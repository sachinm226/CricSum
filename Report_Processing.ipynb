As if losing the series wasn't enough, in the final T20I, they lost 8 for 24 to collapse to 62 all out in a chase of 123. This was their lowest total across limited-overs cricket. It meant Bangladesh took the series 4-1 in Dhaka. Shakib Al Hasan, who nabbed his 100th T20I wicket on the way, led with a haul of 4 for 9, with Mohammad Saifuddin grabbing 3 for 12 as Bangladesh choked Australia, not for the first time, with spin.\n",

The home side made them sweat for it, too, and when the chase subsided to 65 for 6 - with 30 of those runs having come when Dan Christian took Shakib Al Hasan for five sixes in an over - it looked like they could pull off an extraordinary victory. However, Ashton Agar produced a calm and clever innings to take Australia to the brink of the target alongside Ashton Turner. This entire series has been hard work for batters, and this match took it to another level. Bangladesh were set back by the excellent Josh Hazlewood, stumbled against the recalled Mitchell Swepson and only crossed three figures in the final over when Mahedi Hasan struck an enterprising 23 off 16 balls.\n",

While Mahmudullah led from the front by scoring 52 and batting deep to ensure the hosts had some firepower left late in the innings, Mustafizur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan and Nasum Ahmed combined to apply the brakes on Australia's run chase. Debutant Nathan Ellis' hat-trick went in vain for the visitors, for whom Mitchell Marsh continued his fine form and contributed 51, while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa chipped in with the ball. The Fizz delivers again Rahman followed figures of 2 for 16 and 3 for 23 in the series with an exceptional return of 0 for 9 from his four overs. In what was the joint second-most economical effort for a Bangladesh bowler in a completed spell, Rahman turned the game around when he conceded just a single in the 19th over of the Australia innings when they needed an entirely possible 23 from 12 balls with Alex Carey and Dan Christian at the crease.\n",

Bangladesh stumbled but eventually found composure in their chase to take a 2-0 lead in Dhaka with Afif Hossain and Nurul Hasan guiding them home with eight balls to spare. The pitch - a new one - was again slow, although looked rather less slow when Mitchell Starc was racing in with the new ball after Australia's batting had laboured to post 121, in which Mustafizur Rahman was outstanding. At 67 for 5 the chase was wobbling significantly but with such a small target, the required rate was never an issue and the sixth-wicket pair managed to show a calmness that had eluded a few others. After struggling in the Powerplay, Australia had given themselves a foundation to launch in the closing overs with a stand of 57 between Mitchell Marsh and Moises Henriques, and with a fair wind 140 would have been achievable.\n",

Australia had the upper hand at the halfway mark but the dismissal of Alex Carey first ball, followed by two more batters by the third over, meant that they had their backs to the wall early on. After that, though Mitchell Marsh tried to keep Australia in the contest with a patient run-a-ball 45 from No. 3, wickets at regular intervals left them 23 short in the end. Bangladesh used spin right from the first ball.\n",

Nicholas Pooran was bowled without offering a shot AFP Australia's trio of spinners - the recalled Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa and Ashton Turner - shared five wickets with the tally matched by Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood as West Indies could only muster 152 having had the chance to bat first. Evin Lewis, who returned after retiring hurt in the fourth over after a blow on the helmet, was the only batter to pass 18. The chase wobbled to begin with and the spin of Akeal Hosein and Hayden Walsh Jr threatened to undo Australia's good work in the field, but a calculated positive approach from Wade, Alex Carey and Mitchell Marsh paid dividends as the target was quickly whittled down despite the loss of wickets. Marsh's 29 off 21 balls with three sixes made considerable inroads until he fell in a Sheldon Cottrell over that cost 17 - a sizeable chunk of a small chase.\n",

In the end it was Australia's collapse that proved decisive when they crumbled to 45 for 6 as left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein claimed three wickets in six balls. The last four wickets turned the innings around by adding 142, which included a 59-run ninth-wicket stand between Adam Zampa and Wes Agar, then when West Indies slipped to 72 for 5 - with Mitchell Starc again brilliant - there was the chance of a remarkable resurgence. However, Pooran and Holder played with excellent composure knowing that the required rate was never an issue. Pooran was given lives on 26 and 49, the first when Moises Henriques spilled a simple chance at mid-off, and Holder was reprieved by the DRS but it was a well-constructed stand during which Holder brought up his first ODI fifty since the 2019 World Cup while Pooran was unbeaten to finish things off.\n",

Carey, standing in for the injured Aaron Finch, had formed the backbone of Australia's innings with Ashton Turner in a fifth-wicket stand of 104 in 19 overs before Hayden Walsh Jr sparked a late collapse with a career-best five-wicket haul. However, Australia's 252 - which was adjusted to a target of 257 after three rain interruptions cut the match to 49 overs - quickly looked imposing as Starc and Hazlewood got to work with the new ball to leave West Indies in a heap at 27 for 6. Starc took three wickets in his first spell and then returned to end the aggressive rearguard of Kieron Pollard. Pollard hit a 41-ball fifty, but the West Indies captain had been left with far too much ground to regain.\n",

After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Marsh propelled Australia to 189 for 6 with 75 off 44 balls, his third half-century in four innings this series. Defending the total, Marsh followed it up with 3 for 24 including a prized trio of scalps - Chris Gayle, Lendl Simmons and stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran - to stunt momentum in the West Indies chase. Needing 11 off the final over and with Russell on strike, after Riley Meredith had been taken for four sixes by Fabian Allen in the 19th, Starc came around the stumps and bowled four leg stump yorkers that Russell could not get under to elevate and - with only the tail left in at the non-striker's end - resulted in turned down singles on each occasion. On the fifth ball, Russell flubbed a knee-high full toss well short of the rope at deep midwicket before a boundary on the final ball made a cosmetic adjustment to the final margin.\n",

The opener put on a thunderous display, with his first T20I half-century since 2016, to secure a series victory for West Indies as he pummelled the Australia attack around St Lucia in what became a cakewalk of a chase. Having made 102 runs in nine innings since his recall earlier this year, Gayle launched seven sixes in an innings that took him past 14,000 T20 runs. After he departed, stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran ensured there was no hiccup in the chase he closed it out with more than five overs to spare. It is the first time West Indies have won a bilateral series (or more than one match) against Australia in any format since 1995.\n",

The visitors contrived to lose their last six wickets for 19 runs against Obed McCoy and Hayden Walsh Jr having needed less than five over in the second half of the chase. McCoy, who was impressive in the recent series against South Africa, confounded Australia's lower order with his slower-ball variations while Walsh Jr marked his recalled with the key wicket of top-scorer Mitchell Marsh who looked to have put Australia on track with a maiden T20I fifty. In the end it was another maiden T20I half-century, from Andre Russell, which finished on the winning side as his 51 off 28 balls transformed the West Indies innings after they had laboured against an inspired opening burst from Josh Hazlewood who conceded just three runs in his first three overs. Australia surged out of the blocks in the chase with 70 on the board at the end of the powerplay and the loss of three wickets in the same period seemed a reasonable price to pay to be so far ahead of the required run rate.\n",

A pair of wins in spectator-free games had allowed Australia to turn up for the final game with a chance to win from 0-2 down, but on a sunny Sunday afternoon with a crowd again present, Kane Williamson's side scotched early momentum enjoyed by the visitors when Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were in harness to completely dominate the closing overs and leave a target of just 143 to win. Ish Sodhi, Mitchell Santner and Trent Boult all made valuable contributions. Guptill and Conway, joining forces as openers, then powered to a stand worth 101 to mean that a rapid second spell from Riley Meredith was nowhere near enough to prevent the match and series going comfortably New Zealand's way.

On a surface being used for the fourth time in three days (with two more matches to come), scoring was much tougher than when Australia put more than 200 on the board in the previous game. New Zealand had control for the majority of the time in the field - Ish Sodhi and Trent Boult taking five wickets between them - but Finch took full toll in the final over of the innings as Kyle Jamieson was plundered for 26. New Zealand were under pressure from the start of the chase and could not make a dent on the target in the powerplay.

Riley Meredith made an eye-catching debut with his pace helping take crucial early wickets even as New Zealand initially managed to keep up with the steep asking rate, but couldn't maintain it to make a serious dip at the target. In the first half, the foundation for Australia was laid by a stand of 83 between Finch and Josh Philippe, and the latter part of the innings was powered by Maxwell's 31-ball 70 of which 62 runs came in boundaries. The eight overs from 10 to 18 brought 105 runs before New Zealand pulled it back somewhat. Martin Guptill and Devon Conway played well in the chase, but Agar took three wickets in the 13th over to end the contest on his way to a six-wicket haul - just the fourth bowler to achieve that feat in T20Is while also becoming the sixth to take multiple five-wicket hauls in the format.\n",

For most of the day they dominated Australia with the bat and then the ball, to a point when the game looked to be heading for an early finish. Left in a hopeless position, Marcus Stoinis and Daniel Sams chanced their arms to close things up to a realistic scenario, only to lose their poise when the way to victory had re-opened, allowing Kane Williamson's men to hold their nerve in the tight finish that eventuated. New Zealand's momentum began with an overdue return to runs for Martin Guptill, swinging sweetly through the full ball as though on the golf course, with a pair of terrific supporting innings from Williamson and Jimmy Neesham - he and Guptill coshed no fewer than 14 sixes in Dunedin's first game between Australia and New Zealand since 2000.

Devon Conway was calmness and poise personified to maintain his outstanding start to representing New Zealand, compiling an unbeaten 99 to lift his side to 184 for 5 after the Australians had made the swifter start to claim three wickets inside the first four overs. Australia's early success gave way to rather more pedestrian bowling and fielding during the back half of the innings. Chasing at least 20 runs more than they should have been, Aaron Finch's team were never a chance after being left completely bereft by the swinging new ball in the hands of Tim Southee and Trent Boult.

Punctuating the end was Rishabh Pant, newly minted superstar, who could barely hold it together at the presentation when he called this one of the best things to ever happen to him. In cricketing terms, that thing was an expertly paced unbeaten 89 that helped shatter a 32-year streak of Australia not losing at this ground and sealed for India a 2-1 series win with three wickets in hand. Pant's dashing best came during the last hour of play, after a series of partnerships had taken India to within 63 runs of victory at which point they had lost Mayank Agarwal.

A backbone century from Aaron Finch and a blistering one from Steven Smith, coupled with characteristic contributions from David Warner and Glenn Maxwell, vaulted Australia to an imposing 6 for 374, before India's chase was unable to maintain the runaway momentum of a beginning that benefitted from a rare case of Mitchell Starc losing control of the ball.

The home side made them sweat for it, too, and when the chase subsided to 65 for 6 - with 30 of those runs having come when Dan Christian took Shakib Al Hasan for five sixes in an over - it looked like they could pull off an extraordinary victory. However, Ashton Agar produced a calm and clever innings to take Australia to the brink of the target alongside Ashton Turner.

Australia's efforts with the ball were exemplified by Josh Hazlewood, whose spotless 3 for 26 helped keep England just beyond social distance.

ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Jadeja, Chahal, Natarajan help India win series opener (India subcontinent only) Jadeja's exit from the contest - he suffered a hamstring injury first and was then hit on the helmet in the last over of India's innings - allowed India to call upon a wristspinner in Chahal, who had been harshly treated during the ODI series but found himself defending a serviceable total on the night and responding grandly. Yuzvendra Chahal made a big impact after coming on as a concussion substitute Getty Images In contrast, the Australians gradually lost grip of a contest that had appeared more or less in their keeping when India were restricted to 114 for 6 with 19 balls of their innings remaining after Aaron Finch sent them in to bat. A target of 162 should still have been well within the grasp of Finch's team, but their innings sank steadily into the mire thanks to Chahal, T Natarajan's zippy left-armers, and Virat Kohli's growing command of the battlefield. Starc returns in finer fettle Something was not quite right about Mitchell Starc in the first two ODIs, and he was missing from the third with what was described as a minor side and/or rib complaint.\n",

Pandya ended up with a career-best unbeaten 92 off 76, and Jadeja doubled up his 50-ball 66 with the wicket of a set Aaron Finch and a smart low catch in the field. Australia's chase went similar to India's innings - the fourth wickets fell at the exact same point, 123 in 25.3 overs - but the hosts kept losing wickets to fall short by 13 runs. The pitch wasn't as flat as was expected when India won the toss, and it showed in how they managed to successfully defend what was only the third-highest total in a full-length ODI at this heavy-scoring ground.\n",

It was the quick and intense Pat Cummins who precipitated Sri Lanka's collapse, and Cummins who made the greatest impact for Australia through the match. His 6 for 23 in the second innings are his best innings figures, and his 10 for 62 in the match is also a career-best. So outstanding was he late on day two and in day three, that Sri Lanka did not muster a single boundary off his 15 overs, in the second innings. He also essentially sealed the match by removing Sri Lanka's three key batsmen.\n",

But it was given the perfect ending as Yuzvendra Chahal's career-best 6 for 42, the joint best ODI figures in Australia, set up a seven-wicket victory to take the series. Chahal's haul left a modest target but a slow pitch made scoring tricky as MS Dhoni, whose role has dominated the narrative of the series, scored his third half-century in three innings - while being given three lives - and the recalled Kedar Jadhav produced an excellent hand. It's the depth of players available that marks out the best teams and the success of Chahal and Jadhav, playing their first matches of the series in place of the rested Kuldeep Yadav and Ambati Rayudu, slotted in seamlessly. Chahal's second ball of the match began Australia's downfall when he had the in-form Shaun Marsh stumped, and he claimed three wickets in each of his two spells, surpassing his previous best of 5 for 22 against South Africa at Centurion.\n",

The victory set up a series decider in Melbourne on Friday. When Kohli found deep midwicket shortly after reaching his 39th ODI hundred - one he celebrated in animated fashion - India still needed 57 off 38 balls and Dhoni had played a very sedate second fiddle to the captain. He launched Nathan Lyon for six and had just enough in the tank and the legs to ensure a meltdown on social media was perhaps avoided for now.

Those two ingredients combined in Visakhapatnam to produce an intriguing low-scoring thriller, and in the end it was Australia who shaded a tight contest between two imperfect teams. It came down to the last ball, with two runs needed, and Pat Cummins, who had just slapped the previous delivery, a wide full-toss, to the cover boundary, kept his head to complete the job.

Using their pace and bounce to good effect, Cummins and Starc conceded a mere 19 runs from the final four overs of Sri Lanka's innings to restrict Dimuth Karunaratne's team to a mere 239 for 8, after they struggled to build momentum against Australia's varied bowling attack on a slow and wearing pitch - the same one used for Australia's earlier win over England on Saturday.

The warm-up at Southampton, where he was greeted with hostility from a sizable crowd, was no different. He brought up his fourth fifty-plus score since returning from his year-long ban, converting this one into a hundred, which formed the backbone of Australia's 297 for nine.

Australia were so far on top in the first half of the first innings, talk of 350 and 400 rolled easily off the tongue, until a vintage performance from Mohammad Amir curtailed them to 307, his five-for bowling out a side that hadn't lost a single wicket for 22 overs.

This time, mere survival was the limit of England's ambition, but as the tension tightened in another nail-shredding final session, it took an unlikely hero to unlock the resistance of a familiar cult figure.

Smith, the single biggest reason for Australia's Ashes retention, was listed to bat at No. 3 but found himself demoted below Maxwell and Ashton Turner in recognition of their relative hitting power. But on a day where the bowlers followed up by holding the decidedly underwhelming visitors for a mere 9 for 99, in the process securing the home side's biggest ever T20I winning margin and Sri Lanka's biggest ever T20I defeat, the lack of reliance upon Smith augured well for the rest of Australia's summer.\n",

Pakistan went right through to the final session before Australia finally wore them down and succumbed to another convincing innings defeat. A few positives aside, this really has been a bleak series for the visitors. Nathan Lyon enjoyed a bit of personal glory, completing his first five-wicket haul against Pakistan. It will do his confidence much good, given the offspinner's rather ordinary numbers against this particular opposition, and in a contest where every one of Australia's bowlers enjoyed great success, they couldn't have hoped for a better launch pad to the three-match series against New Zealand later this month.\n",

When Pakistan were reduced to 5 for 94 in the morning session - the same position they found themselves in the first innings - the prospect of Australia needing the second new ball or coming close to batting again seemed far-fetched. However, Azam and Rizwan added 132 for the sixth wicket then Rizwan was joined by Yasir Shah to put on 79 for the seventh. The loss of Rizwan for 95, moments before the second new ball was taken, ended the resistance and the Pakistan fast bowlers were in for a good time, not a long time. Josh Hazlewood finished with 4 for 63 in what was Australia's 13th straight victory at home against Pakistan.\n",

In front of a crowd of 22,626, a gleeful Aaron Finch sent the tourists in to bat on a lively Perth Stadium pitch, and Pakistan never recovered from the loss of three wickets inside their Powerplay. Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, the recalled Sean Abbott, Billy Stanlake and Ashton Agar covered for the rested Pat Cummins with ease, sharing wickets and responsibility for strangling the batting in an innings that featured no fewer than 26 plays and misses. Additionally, the Australians fielded and caught with rare polish, ensuring that very few Pakistani mistakes went unpunished. A final tally of 106 was about all that can be expected of Pakistan on days when Babar Azam does not bail them out with a score, as they have fallen into a deep T20I hole that had also seen them whitewashed at home by Sri Lanka prior to this one.\n",

A commanding half-century that combined pugnacity and poise in exactly the right doses steered Australia to what ended up being a stroll of a chase against Pakistan with victory by seven wickets. It needn't have been as easy as that, though, and didn't look nearly as comfortable when they lost David Warner and Aaron Finch inside the powerplay, more than a hundred runs still to get without the comfort blanket of an explosive Glenn Maxwell in the middle order. It was an innings every bit as modern as T20 cricket requires of its players, but the 51-ball 80 Smith struck contained shots that wouldn't have been out of place at this year's Ashes. Eleven fours and a six, exactly a half-century of them, came in boundaries, and by the final two overs, Smith was properly peaking.\n",

Chasing a revised 119 in 15 overs, after Pakistan's innings was interrupted after 12.4 overs, Aaron Finch laid into Mohammad Irfan's second over which cost 26 runs - including two sixes and a no-ball that went for four - and put them well ahead in the chase, with the wicketless par score after five overs being 33. However, with 11 balls still needed to reach the five-over mark and constitute a match the rain returned. At the other end to Finch, David Warner didn't need to do much more than watch as he finished on 2 off 4 deliveries which extended his run of being unbeaten in T20Is.\n",

They held Sri Lanka to a sub-par total of 6 for 142 before mowing it down with seven wickets and 14 balls to spare.

Pattinson's three-wicket pre-lunch burst appeared to be hurtling New Zealand to a swift defeat, but Blundell stood up magnificently to the challenge. However, Lyon's 4 for 81 ensured Australia would not have to return on Monday to wrap things up. After being set a hypothetical 488 for victory - following Australia's declaration 10 overs into the day - New Zealand plummeted to 3 for 35 as Pattinson claimed three wickets in nine balls which included losing Kane Williamson for a duck.

Tim Paine's Australians will be delighted not only to have wrapped up a 296-run win over Kane Williamson's men inside four days, but also to have done so despite losing Josh Hazlewood after the New South Welshman had bowled a mere eight deliveries for the match. James Pattinson looks highly likely to replace Hazlewood for the MCG, though the coach Justin Langer has already hinted that five bowlers may well be chosen in expectation of a \"play it safe\" pitch after last week's abandoned Sheffield Shield game. Either way, Starc, Cummins and Lyon will take some stopping, having rolled New Zealand twice for little more than 300 runs on an excellent Perth pitch that offered runs for quality batting but also provided plenty of pace, bounce and eventual deterioration for the bowlers. And as well as the tourists bowled to Australia, particularly David Warner and Steven Smith, they were left with plenty of hard evidence that Paine's men have decided advantages in depth and suitability to the prevailing conditions.\n",

A trio of players from out west - Mitchell Marsh, AJ Tye and Marcus Stoinis - had prospered earlier in the match, but it was the effervescent Curran who had the final say, years after he had been childhood friends with Marsh when growing up in Zimbabwe. Australia seemed to be travelling comfortably in pursuit of 260 for victory, after England's batsmen had squandered a series of starts, when Stoinis fell within sight of a hundred upon his promotion to No. 3 in the home side's batting order.

The new-ball pair of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood filleted England's top order, but Chris Woakes' doughty rearguard and Adil Rashid's variations allowed the Australia Day ODI to creep into floodlit hours while Travis Head guided his team close to home. A slimmer-than-expected Adelaide Oval crowd of 24,329 seemed destined to be filing out of the exits early when Cummins and Hazlewood combined to have Eoin Morgan's side a sickly 5 for 8 as the new ball swung and seamed, before Woakes delivered his latest outstanding display of a series England had already won. Woakes' innings ensured that Australia needed at least one score of note to register their first ODI win since last year's India tour and only their second since January 2017, and it was Head, returning to the top of the order in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch, who provided it.

Although Marcus Stoinis kept Australia in the hunt until the final over, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes closed the game out with another smart display of death bowling. England had been struggling on 6 for 189 when Buttler and Woakes came together but they put on an unbroken 113-run stand to take the total beyond 300.

Five days later at the Gabba it proved a prescient assessment, as the visitors did without a Jason Roy special to again run rings around a desperately muddled Australia. Clearly, Australia's decision-makers had judged themselves to have not made enough runs in Melbourne - Adam Zampa was out and Cameron White in. As if to take the mickey out of that choice, England employed three spinners to bog down the hosts after Steven Smith won the toss, before taking a horrid toll on Travis Head when he was employed as the quasi-specialist Australian slow bowler.\n",

That expectation was turned dramatically on its head by a rampant Jason Roy, who soared to England's highest ever 50-over score, and in the company of a rejuvenated Joe Root helped England fly to the steepest ever ODI chase on the MCG with seven balls to spare. If this was the first match of a series lacking much in the way of context, Roy's combination of daring and determination - with a dash of good fortune via numerous skiers that landed safely - will allow England to look optimistically towards next year's World Cup. It was on this ground, of course, where Australia had thrashed England in the opening match of the previous tournament, setting the scene for their ultimate success.

Five days on from Australia's world-record T20 chase, New Zealand opted to set a target again; this time, after an excellent bowling display on a less-frisky surface, the requirement over 120 balls was almost 100 runs fewer. D'Arcy Short capped an excellent debut series by crunching his second T20I fifty and the match descended into a hit'n'gurgle as the rain swept in for a second time.

D'Arcy Short and David Warner hammered aggressive fifties to set the tone of the reply and Australia's middle order kept the pedal to the metal at a stage where New Zealand had stuttered to seal victory with more than an over to spare. The stands were peppered for 32 sixes - equalling the T20I record - as the odd-shaped boundaries at Eden Park produced a lop-sided match in which batsman were able to swing with impunity and bowling became an exercise in damage limitation. No team had successfully chased as many in all T20 cricket.

Wickets were followed by runs to guide the Australians home for the second time in as many matches, though Maxwell was fortunate to be reprieved when 53 were still required with six wickets in hand. Lofting Adil Rashid down the ground, he appeared to be caught low down by Jason Roy, but stood his ground for the third umpire to grant Maxwell a second chance as television replays were, as they so often are, inconclusive. He made the most of it, striking a six to win the game and also reach three figures.

On the same Trent Bridge ground where they plundered the previous record - 444 for 3 against Pakistan in August 2016 in the most recent completed ODI on the ground - England thrashed 21 sixes and 41 fours in becoming the first side to reach 450 in ODI history. Only once in the 56-year history of List A cricket - when Surrey scored 496 for 4 against Gloucestershire at The Oval in 2007 - has any side scored more. The result means England have taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Australia have now lost five ODI series in succession and eight of their last nine ODIs against England.\n",

On a day that had already seen Australia's male international teams lose to France (in the football World Cup) and Ireland (in a rugby union international), England registered the highest score they had ever made against Australia in ODI cricket and the highest score made in an ODI in Cardiff. It was enough to see Australia's cricketers suffer the same fate as their compatriots and means that England have now won seven of the last eight ODIs between these sides. It makes Scotland's success over England in Edinburgh a week ago seem ever more impressive. The result was a cruel return for Shaun Marsh after a hugely impressive innings.\n",

Despite their rookie bowling attack mounting a spirited defence of a substandard target of 215, England overcame a double dose of jitters to seal a three-wicket victory in the first ODI at The Kia Oval. Most of the pre-series focus had, rightly, been on the absence of Australia's finest two batsmen, David Warner and Steven Smith, and, as might have been expected, they struggled to mitigate for that void in class. After winning the toss on a bright afternoon in South London, Australia mustered 214 in 47 overs, the sort of slow-death innings that exposed their shortcomings more comprehensively than a full-on batting collapse could have done. Nevertheless, England aren't without a few notable embarrassments in their (very) recent history, and only days after failing to close out a chase of 372 to hand Scotland a famous victory, they came improbably close to stumbling in pursuit of a target of barely half that height.\n",

He was the only one of the Australians' top order not to make a start against Middlesex at Lord's as Travis Head's century anchored the innings before the home side's chase faded away. Maxwell was lbw sweeping at left-arm spinner Ravi Patel as Middlesex's trio of spinners did an excellent job - none more so than 20-year-old Max Holden who bowled his 10 overs for 29 - in throttling the Australians' innings in a similar manner to how Sussex fought back a couple of days ago. On that occasion, Maxwell drove the part-time legspin of Luke Wells to mid-off for 1 and his lack of runs in England follow on from a lean IPL. The Australians shuffled their batting order for this outing with Head promoted to open - back to the position where he finished the previous series against England - Aaron Finch slipping down to the middle and Shaun Marsh replacing Marcus Stoinis at No.\n",

In the end, Australia's attack came through - with help from some poor shot selection by Sussex - to secure a 57-run victory, a margin that flattered them somewhat. Marcus Stoinis' hundred, batting at No. 3, was the highlight for the Australians but their innings faltered badly from 167 for 1 after 30 overs while their pace attack looked thin as the lack of caps would suggest. \"It's good to start a tour like that [with a hundred], but more importantly it's just fun to be out there with our mates,\" Stoinis said.\n",

What with the Wimbledon Championships kicking off and the World Cup approaching its enthralling climax, this T20 tri-series in Harare (which, as far as we can tell, doesn't really have a name) was never destined to be the highlight of July's sporting calendar.

Having beaten Pakistan comfortably in their first meeting, the Australians put in an unfocused performance, dropping far too short with the new ball after Finch sent Sarfraz Ahmed's side in to bat to allow Fakhar Zaman to fire off a succession of pull shots on his way to the highest score of the match. They then lost a series of early wickets to the late moving ball in the hands of Faheem Ashraf and the 18-year-old left-armer Shaheen Afridi. Having slid as low as 75 for 5, Australia never looked likely to get close to their target, though the wicketkeeper and vice-captain Alex Carey played another intelligent innings down the order.

Aaron Finch bludgeoned his way to within three runs of Chris Gayle's world-record Twenty20 score and bettered his own chart-topper in Twenty20 internationals as Australia cantered to a second victory in as many days in the triangular series in Harare. Placing his stamp on the tournament and Australia's short-form captaincy, Finch blazed 10 sixes in an opening stand of 223 - with a more subdued D'Arcy Short - that lasted until the final over of the visitors' innings after they were sent in by Zimbabwe. Left with three balls to make the four runs he required to set a new world record score in all T20 matches, Finch was dismissed hit wicket when aiming for one more mighty blow.

Making the most of what early-morning life existed in a dry surface, Stanlake blasted out the top-four Pakistani batsmen in a spell of 4 for 8, helped by three fine catches from his captain Aaron Finch, who had granted his young spearhead the chance to bowl first by winning the toss and kept him going for four consecutive overs. The game was more or less decided by Stanlake's burst, with all four wickets falling to catches behind the wicket. If Fakhar Zaman seemed nonplussed by his dismissal, adjudged caught down the leg side when attempting a hook shot at another high bouncing Stanlake projectile, then there was no broadcasting budget room for DRS to determine whether or not he was right to quibble.

A 93-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan and Babar Azam - who top-scored for Pakistan yet again with 50 - took Pakistan to a total in a region that's been too good for Australia all series. This time they reached a square 150, and even though the visitors started brightly - Imad Wasim was dispatched for 20 in the first over - the pressure of Pakistan's bowling took its toll on Australia.

UAE batted first and made 117, and later had Australia 32 for 2 in the sixth over. Then their inexperience showed and Australia took the game away, romping to a seven-wicket win with 23 balls remaining.

David Warner and Travis Head gave the Adelaide Oval crowd special reason to enjoy the national holiday by rewriting the record books and compiling the all-time highest ODI partnership for Australia, a 284-run stand that set up a hefty win over Pakistan in the final match of the series. For a dead rubber, this game had plenty of bounce - at least, while Australia were batting. Their 7 for 369 meant Pakistan would have required the third-highest successful chase in ODI history if they were to emerge with a consolation win; it was simply too big a task, despite a century from Babar Azam and a typically entertaining 79 from Sharjeel Khan. Although Pakistan managed their highest total of the series - 312 - they still suffered a 57-run defeat, and will fly home with a 1-4 ODI series loss to sit alongside their 0-3 result in the Tests.\n",

Perhaps what he meant was that he chases pretty well at the WACA. Last summer, Smith plundered 149 as Australia hunted down a target of 310 against India, winning in the last over.

And not since January 2005 had Pakistan beaten Australia in Australia, in any format. Pakistan ended both those dry spells in a contest that illustrated familiar strengths for the visitors and plenty of increasingly tiresome weaknesses among the hosts. On a sluggish surface Australia's batsmen were cornered by Pakistan's spinners, allowing for a chase within the modest reach of their batsmen. Earlier in the day Australia had unveiled their touring party for a Test series in India next month, with the spin bowler Mitchell Swepson speaking outside the MCG.\n",

Defeat may be particularly ruinous for the visitors given an apparent hamstring tear to the captain Azhar Ali, who must now be in grave doubt for the rest of the tour. Azhar suffered the injury early in Pakistan's ultimately doomed pursuit, and did it no favours when coming back out to bat at the fall of the sixth wicket. Brisbane's hot and humid weather also claimed an Australian casualty, with the debutant Billy Stanlake appearing in some distress and unable to add to his initial three overs.

The frequent omission of Zampa from Australia's ODI and Twenty20 sides - despite an excellent record in both formats - has been a mystery for quite some time, and there appeared to be thinly veiled frustration on the part of the bowler as he accounted for the series' pivotal player Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedara and Dasun Shanaka in quick succession to push a target of 188 beyond the reach of the visitors. His wickets came not from any extravagant turn but instead useful changes of pace and unrelenting attack on the stumps, winning a pair of back foot lbw verdicts from the umpire Paul Wilson either side of another slider that bowled Kapugedara between bat and pad. Australia's selectors had admitted to choosing an \"attacking\" spinner in Mitchell Swepson over what the panel's chairman Trevor Hohns called a more \"defensive\" operator in Zampa. Sri Lanka made a rapid start to their chase but a sturdy Australian effort with the bat meant that they did not have much room to lose momentum.\n",

For the second time in three days, Sri Lanka reached their target from the final ball of their chase, but whereas at the MCG they had needed only 18 off the last three overs, here they needed 48. Gunaratne ensured that they did it in style. Forty-eight off 18 balls became 36 off 12, and then came the over that turned things firmly in Sri Lanka's favour. Moises Henriques, who earlier had struck an unbeaten half-century to set Sri Lanka a target of 174, failed to find the right lengths and was plundered for three consecutive sixes by Gunaratne, as well as a four, and it left them requiring 14 from the final over, to be bowled by Andrew Tye.\n",

The hosts and their three debutants fought to the finish against the visitors in front of a raucous crowd at the MCG, but a win offered Sri Lanka the chance to wrap up the series at Kardinia Park on Sunday. The Perth Scorchers' Andrew Tye was left with six runs to defend from the final over, and one from the final ball. Chamara Kapugedara surveyed the ring field then punched the winning boundary through the covers to secure the result.

That they are doing so has less to do with damp English weather than the verve of the home side, personified by the pace of Mark Wood, the guile of Adil Rashid, the leadership of Eoin Morgan and the raw power of Ben Stokes. This was a meeting between a confident, aggressive England favoured to lift the Champions Trophy and an out-of-season Australia playing their first completed match of the trip.

In failing to capitalise fully on a 231-run opening stand, they left themselves susceptible to a fourth such reversal, but better fielding than India and excellent bowling from their quicks made sure India's ODI juggernaut was halted at nine wins in a row, still their longest streak. David Warner scored a hundred in his 100th ODI, Aaron Finch biffed his way to 94 and to the top of the runs chart this series despite playing only two matches, but Australia managed just 102 runs in the last 15 overs, setting India 335. For a good part of the chase, India seemed on course to add to their record of five successful chases of 330 or more and Australia's unwanted record of eight unsuccessful defences of 330 or more, but their fielders and bowlers redeemed themselves on a damp outfield where it couldn't have been easy to grip the ball.

The first two ODIs bucked that high-scoring trend, with India defending 281 and then 252, but a belter of a pitch in Indore seemed set to catalyse a return to the old order. Coming back from a calf injury, Aaron Finch scored his eighth ODI hundred and put on 154 for the second wicket with Steven Smith to project visions of 350 into Australia's minds. But thanks to their wristspinners, and then their two expert death bowlers, India kept them to 293 for 6, taking five wickets and only conceding 77 in the last 14 overs.

On a pitch with more bounce than an average Indian ODI surface, Pandya's sensational six-hitting combined with MS Dhoni's pragmatism to lift India from 87 for 5 to 281, but persistent drizzle converted the 282-run target into a theoretically-easier 164 in 21 overs. Pandya then introduced the world to his knuckle ball to send back Steven Smith and Travis Head. Smith had a rare shocker of a match, dropping two catches at slip, including Pandya, who went on to score 83 off 67 balls, and made Adam Zampa his fourth victim of three successive sixes in three months in international cricket.

Warner raced to 64 off 48 balls and dominated the partnership of 106 before Kushang Patel, another medium-pacer, had him caught behind.

But for a short while it looked like India's 295 in Melbourne might have been enough to keep this series alive. That was until Glenn Maxwell took it upon himself to bat India out of the match, his 96 steering Australia to a third successive record chase to seal the five-match one-day series with two to play. Though Maxwell fell with one run still required, James Faulkner finished the deal with seven balls to spare.

A draw was the inevitable result of a Test in which only 150.1 overs were bowled due to wet weather, but Warner's 82-ball hundred at least ensured there was good reason to watch the final day's play. Cricket Australia had thrown open the gates and declared free entry, and the local fans hoped they would see the Australians bat early in the day.

MS Dhoni perhaps? It was a good thing for India the two of them were together in the dying stages of their quasi quarter-final against Australia in Mohali. Dhoni's men progressed to a semi-final, against West Indies, and ended Australia's World T20 campaign, and the international career of Shane Watson, with a chase of impeccable timing led by Kohli. Set 161 for victory, India saw their required run-rate balloon up past 10 an over, up towards 12 an over, but Kohli was always poised to prick the balloon. He did so with such perfect timing - 19 runs coming off the 18th over from James Faulkner and then 16 off the next from Nathan Coulter-Nile - that you felt he never doubted himself.

A storming display with the bat was followed by an improved showing with the ball, setting up what will be effectively an elimination match against India in the final match of the Super 10s on Sunday. The captain Steven Smith chose Mohali as the venue where he found his rhythm, in turn modulated then audacious in an innings that controlled the tempo of a strong total. He was helped in large part by Shane Watson, who batted with the air of a man freed of tension by his retirement announcement on match eve.

Adam Zampa and Usman Khawaja produced noteworthy performances at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, but others were less convincing ahead of more demanding meetings with Pakistan and India. Bangladesh never quite seemed confident enough to push through for victory, particularly after the the loss of Taskin Ahmed and Arafat Sunny due to queries over their bowling actions. Mustafizur Rahman bowled beautifully for his captain Mashrafe Mortaza, however, and in doing so delivered another low score for Australia's leader Steven Smith, who seems to be wrestling with his game only a matter of weeks after being thrust into the T20 captaincy ahead of Aaron Finch.

Having spun India out in Nagpur, New Zealand made one change to their side, bringing in the fast bowler Mitchell McClenaghan to replace the spinner Nathan McCullum. McClenaghan duly took 3 for 17 and played a significant role in derailing Australia's innings. Australia, by comparison, seemed confused at the selection table.

The result means that the same puzzle that has faced South Africa all summer remains unsolved. Their middle-order is still missing some reliability and they have yet to decide who to anoint as their fifth bowler. Australia, on the other hand, have answered some of their own questions.

Australia had slipped to 32 for 3 in pursuit of 205 before David Warner and Glenn Maxwell posted a record fourth-wicket partnership of 161 but were both dismissed to set up a thrilling, last-ball finish.

Marsh's emergence as a performer under pressure was a major positive of Australia's otherwise workman-like defeat of West Indies and the already vanquished South Africa, making it fitting that he landed the decisive blows against a doughty home side. A spell of 3 for 6 featured the wickets of Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Johnson Charles in successive overs, breaking the back of the West Indies chase and leaving too much for their heavy-hitting lower order to do. Josh Hazlewood followed up with five wickets of his own, the finishing touch arriving with a typically mercurial catch by Glenn Maxwell. Australia also owed much to the wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, who muscled his way to a half-century with the tail that atoned for earlier wasted starts by the top order, while also reaffirming his place in the team.\n",

Interim coach Justin Langer had been eager to see how his team responded under the pressure of possible tournament elimination, and Marlon Samuels' fine hundred in partnership with Denesh Ramdin ensured Australia's batsmen had little margin for error at Kensington Oval. However, Smith produced the workmanlike innings of a leader and was able to coax Marsh into one of his best and most complete international innings, albeit on a surface that bore closer resemblance to Australian climes than any other in this series. Maxwell then came in with the game still in the balance - Australia needed 62 off 50 balls - and responded with a starburst of shots that will help his own sense of esteem enormously after a series in which he was dropped for two matches.

Just as November's Bangalore Test involved long periods of watching and waiting, the first game of the series in Barbados dragged on for over five hours because of intermittent rain, which denied South Africa an opportunity to qualify for the final. Instead they shared points with Australia, who now face a must-win clash against hosts West Indies in their final league fixture at the same venue on Tuesday.

From a strong platform of 139 for 1 after 27 overs the visitors' innings lost momentum, and the target of 266 was vulnerable to an early assault on the short boundaries of Warner Park. Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher duly hurled themselves at a bowling attack that was missing Mitchell Starc, and were helped by a pair of dropped catches from Usman Khawaja. Those misses helped take West Indies to an opening stand of 74 inside 10 overs, and that early acceleration allowed Samuels to sculpt an innings in his familiar style - long periods of inactivity mixed with brief bursts of power and inspiration.

Facing a South African side resting three first-choice bowlers in a dead rubber, Steven Smith's side were shot out for a mere 167 to set-up a six-wicket win. Kyle Abbott and Tabraiz Shamsi were the chief tormentors of the tourists, the former finding exactly the right length to best use the early movement on offer, the latter re-opening the sorts of wounds inflicted by Sri Lanka's spin bowlers on Australia's previous tour with a clever spell of left arm wrist-spin. Neither had been needed in the live matches. Save for a 50 by Mitchell Marsh and a punchy contribution from Matthew Wade, the most notable moment for Australia was Wade's running battle with Shamsi.\n",

Miller has chosen not to play his domestic cricket at the Durban-based Dolphins this summer but thrilled his former home crowd during the highest successful chase at Kingsmead with a heroic knock that will become the stuff of legend. In the 31st over, with Miller on 26 and South Africa needing to score at more than eight runs an over, he tweaked a groin muscle running between the wickets. At the start of the next over, South Africa lost their fifth wicket and their last specialist batsmen when JP Duminy holed out. They were 217 for 5 and victory was 155 runs away.\n",

Instead, the dead-rubber bounce that Test cricket so often produces again manifested itself as Australia chased down 127 to win the third Test against South Africa at Adelaide Oval.

Asad Shafiq's sublime century and sturdy support from Yasir Shah took Steven Smith's men close to their wit's end, but a Mitchell Starc short ball did for Shafiq when the visitors needed only 41 runs to steal the most fanciful of victories.

Australia returned to the scene of their 2015 World Cup final hiding of New Zealand and duly inflicted another enormous defeat on the visitors, completing the first clean sweep of a Chappell-Hadlee series in a decade, in front of a far smaller gathering than last time. Only 20,591 spectators were on hand to see the heavy lifting done by the vice-captain David Warner, who soared to his second ODI hundred in as many innings and seventh of the year, in conditions far more challenging than those prepared for either of the first two matches of the series. Warner's innings was all the more laudable for the fact that most batsmen found scoring difficult on a slow and capricious pitch.

Now, as then, there were mitigating circumstances: the pitch looked to have something in it after rain, and humid, overcast weather suggested apt conditions for swing. But after a couple of useful early deliveries things cleared for Australia's batsmen; so much so that they accelerated to the team's second highest total on home soil. David Warner and Steven Smith set a platform that a supercharged Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh took full advantage of, leaving Williamson's visitors to chase in hope rather than expectation.

Aaron Finch twanged a hamstring as his side fell apart under the pressure of a chase for the second time in as many matches. The game evolved in a near action replay of the opening match in Adelaide, as Australia were unable to capitalise on a strong start by Finch and Shaun Marsh in pursuit of a strong Indian total built upon the batting of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

David Warner and Mitchell Marsh had made centuries for Australia, but the allrounder conceded 13 from the final over of the night to allow the visitors avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 series sweep.

John Hastings and Kane Richardson were the architects of a staggering passage of implosion by the visitors - losing 9 for 46 after centuries from Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan had taken India to a mere 72 runs shy of victory with 75 balls remaining.

Professional sport, though, is about pushing through all distractions and preparing for what lies ahead.

There has been much to enjoy over the five Tests in a series watched by capacity crowds - and lovers of Test cricket will delight in that - but history is likely to judge this hit-and-miss series one of the more insubstantial affairs between two teams possessing striking inconsistencies - loved for their skill, unlikely to be hailed for their resilience. Alastair Cook, England's captain, will make light of that, content that after a 5-0 whitewash in Australia the Ashes have been regained. \"I honestly believe this is a highly-talented group of players,\" he said. \"Being underdogs helped us and allowed us to play with a bit of freedom.\n",

If so, events at Wantage Road gave some indication of exactly how much he will be missed by the remainder of the batting order.

Led by a strong performance from their fast bowlers, who rolled England for 138, Australia cruised to an eight-wicket victory in the final ODI Old Trafford and ended their three-month tour of England, which featured the disappointment of another failed Ashes campaign, with a 3-2 win in the one-day series. Mitchell Marsh and John Hastings might hardly be the most intimidating pair of fast bowlers but it was they who caused England's collapse, between them collecting seven of the nine wickets that fell.

It was, in the end, a near perfectly judged run chase. England needed 300, exactly a run a ball in 50 overs, and Morgan showed his team-mates how to pace the pursuit, with 92 off 92 balls himself.

A maiden international century from Man of the Match James Taylor provided the bedrock of England's total of 300, before their spinners went to work on a dry surface, claiming 5 for 73 between them in 20 overs.

Eoin Morgan, who had sent the Australians in under cloudy skies, then did his best to salvage England's chase with a near-run-a-ball 85, but just like in the first ODI, wickets fell and the target was too big.

When the pair came together Australia were precariously placed on 193 for 6 and had just lost three wickets for 15 runs. But Wade, timing the ball as well as anyone, produced his highest ODI score since August 2012 - and his highest ever against a Full Member nation - as Australia added 93 from the final 10 overs.

Johnson's final acts in Test cricket were to take two wickets in the last session as New Zealand's batsmen played out a draw, but it was a result that meant Australia retained the Trans-Tasman Trophy after their win in the first Test in Brisbane. Johnson departed from Test cricket to the cheers of his adopted home crowd, with 313 Test victims to his name. The WACA is a venue where Johnson has previously taken clumps of wickets quickly, sometimes late in the day, but New Zealand began the final session with all ten wickets in hand.

The steep and increasingly variable bounce of the pitch accounted for most of New Zealand's last seven wickets, while Nathan Lyon's growing fourth-innings expertise was demonstrated by his three wickets and constant threat to the batsmen. Brendon McCullum offered a typically defiant riposte but lacked support, and then found his innings ended by one of two umpiring calls that left a bitter taste in New Zealand mouths. However, there was evidence that McCullum's men would fight this series out as the last pair of Mark Craig and Trent Boult hammered a partnership of 46 that entertained the smallest of crowds while also causing the red mist to descend upon several Australian players. All this left Australia in possession of a 1-0 series lead but a feeling that New Zealand will be a more difficult proposition in the second Test at the WACA Ground next week, even if they have lost the allrounder Jimmy Neesham to a back ailment and will be in some doubt about being able to choose Tim Southee for Perth due to a similar problem.\n",

Having fought hard over the final two days of the Test, West Indies lost their final four wickets for 32 in ten overs, allowing Steven Smith's team to enjoy success inside four days after they declared before play began to set Jason Holder's men a target of 460. With the benefit of more time in Australia, the visitors put up a better show than they managed in Hobart, though the hosts were never in any danger of losing the match. It was more a question of time, and Holder was despondent at a checked drive to mid-off that opened up the tail to the second new ball with a handful of overs remaining in the day.

Hapless, hopeless and helpless, West Indies collapsed to their second-heaviest defeat in Tests against Australia as James Pattinson marked his return with a five-wicket haul that destroyed the top order. Australia batted for the first four sessions of the match and lost only four wickets; West Indies batted less than four sessions and lost all their wickets, for both innings, crushed by an innings and 212 runs before tea on the third afternoon.

By the time Ravi Bopara went on a late six-hitting surge, England (who would dearly have loved one of those blows the other night in Adelaide) were out of contention although Australia will have been grateful that they had as many as 4 for 213 to work with. Their total, on a pristine pitch and with one boundary of barely 50 yards towards the building site, was set up by an opening stand of 106 in less than 10 overs between Aaron Finch and Cameron White. Who needs David Warner? For a while it looked like Finch would replicate his record-breaking hundred at the Ageas Bowl last year, when he slammed 156, so there will have been a degree of relief from England when he was cut-off for the small matter of 52 off 31 balls but considerable damage had already been done.

In a scrappy contest dictated largely by the sluggishness of Adelaide Oval's drop-in pitch, Australia posted a mediocre total but defended it grandly against an England team who threatened to take control at several stages of the chase but could never quite manage to wrest command of the evening. Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan all contributed useful scores to take England close, but it was left to Ravi Bopara to try to take his team to a second win in a row. He seemed likely to carry them there, until falling victim to a most unfortunate end, as Matthew Wade's fumble behind the stumps bounced back onto the leg bail with the batsman's foot barely raised.

On the evidence of an SCG contest that ended with Australia wrapping up their second consecutive ODI series victory over England in the minimum three matches, the hosts' predilection for the former is matched by their visitors' weakness for the latter. Though less dramatic and perhaps less demoralising than James Faulkner's Gabba heist had been, this defeat underlined England's rut and Australia's peak as well as any of the seven previous matches on the tour. Alastair Cook's side won the toss on a pitch favouring the side batting first and made a swift start, yet found themselves fatally slowed as much by their own lack of conviction as Australia's neat bowling and high class fielding. Australia's chase was not quite perfect, as no batsman made a hundred and wickets were lost to loose strokes, but the belief surging through the team was demonstrated by the jaunty run rate pursued throughout, and best exemplified by the sight of David Warner swinging a six down the ground the over after Aaron Finch's dismissal playing a similarly full-blooded stroke.\n",

Just when England's grim, debilitating tour looked as though it would have a moment of relief, James Faulkner carried Australia to a heart-stopping one-wicket victory at the Gabba with three balls to spare. Left with No. 11 Clint McKay for company and 57 runs still needed, Faulkner calmly turned down singles and backed himself to find the required boundaries, which he did with regularity as he knocked off the final 25 needed in seven deliveries. He hit five sixes in total, including two in the penultimate over off Ben Stokes (who Faulkner hit for all his sixes), then closed out the match with three consecutive boundaries in the final over from Tim Bresnan to leave England shattered and now facing the prospect of another whitewash.

They overwhelmed the hosts in the longest and shortest format at the venue to claim both trophies on offer in their month-long visit and winning the T20 series by a 2-0 margin. In conditions that offered swing and seam movement, Australia's bowlers restricted South Africa to a below-par total. Their batsmen, sans David Warner who was rested for the final game, chased it down like a team in a hurry and they are - to get to the World T20 in Bangladesh. Australia will go there far more prepared than South Africa after a clinical performance that exposed South Africa's vulnerabilities, especially without their two pace spearheads.\n",

Steady rain had threatened successive washouts in the series but relented to allow a sizeable crowd some action. Australia needed 15 going into the final over and Wayne Parnell conceded only a run each off the first two deliveries, but Hodge was to seal it with two balls to spare, the couple of sixes followed by one called wide for height. David Warner was South Africa's tormentor again at the start of the chase, as he and Aaron Finch took 21 off Lonwabo Tsotsobe's first over. Warner then hit debutant Beuran Hendricks for three successive boundaries in the third over as Australia surged to 44 for 1 in three overs.\n",

The captain Elton Chigumbura engineered the chase that changed 11,406 days of history, after his spinners had applied a stranglehold that kept Australia to their lowest total against Zimbabwe, and achieved only their second win against these opponents. Chigumbura's opposite number, Michael Clarke, battled a hamstring niggle that ruled him out of the rest of the tri-series, and held his side together on a spin-friendly surface on which none of the other Australian batsmen settled. But Zimbabwe's challenge was always going to be chasing a total over 200 - they were dismissed for less in their last four ODIs - and when Nathan Lyon picked up career-best figures and they were reduced to 156 for 7, another collapse seemed likely. A 55-run stand between Chigumbura and Prosper Utseya for the eighth wicket ensured Zimbabwe did not fold and sent Harare Sports Club into frenzied celebration.\n",

In that one shot, all the questions about South Africa's ability to take on the best were answered. De Villiers saw his childhood friend Faf du Plessis record his first ODI century in his 51st game, scored a hundred of his own and was there to scamper the winning single when JP Duminy called for it with 21 balls remaining. The seven-wicket win in a 300-plus chase was as comprehensive as South Africa could have wanted after Australia controlled most of first half. Aaron Finch's fourth ODI century saw them through the middle-over squeeze and set up for a strong finish.\n"

Steyn's four wickets, which included two in two balls, led a surge through the Australian middle-order in which South Africa plucked five wickets for 29 runs.

The Australia lower order battled manfully but could not erase the sins of the top six, who apart from David Warner failed utterly in conditions that have become an all too familiar source of trouble.

The result was not so much the issue for the Australians as giving players the chance for some match practice; on that front the last day was disappointing as well. Mitchell Marsh, who had made a third-ball duck in the first innings, stuck around for 35 from 54 deliveries as his audition for a Test debut gradually improved, but he was unable to post an attention-grabbing score.

Smith struck 101 to set up Australia's comfortable 93-run victory over Pakistan in the first ODI in Sharjah, where Nathan Lyon, another man just establishing himself in the one-day team, also made an important contribution. Smith was the only batsman from either side who passed 50 and it was thanks to his confident work against spin that Australia reached a competitive 255 for 8. Still, it was a total that Pakistan would have fancied their chances of overhauling had Lyon not struck twice in the 13th over to reduce them from 59 for 1 to 59 for 3 during an excellent spell of off-spin bowling.

The hosts had more to play for in this fixture than the visitors, and it showed during their chase of 275, reduced from 281 by the second of two brief showers for the day. Finch, Watson and Smith all struck the ball cleanly, though the latter's sublime run of scores was maintained partly by some ordinary work in the field by a South African side missing AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn. Morne Morkel's confidence ebbed away, as epitomised by a dreadful misfield to concede a boundary to Smith, who was also bowled off a Kyle Abbott no-ball and edged Morkel behind though the South Africans did not deign to appeal.

In front of a crowd of 10,583 at Manuka Oval, Finch set the platform and Smith capitalised fully upon it against a South African bowling attack that found less assistance than they enjoyed in Perth but also did not help their cause with a quartet of no-balls. Dale Steyn was the lone exemplar of parsimony for the visitors, but even his 10 overs ultimately yielded 53 runs, and he was unable to take the wickets he had yearned for when describing a new attack role for himself on match eve.

Morkel's career-best 5 for 21 helped to skittle Australia for 154, a total that was barely half of what they made in the first game on Friday and showed how fortunate they were that South Africa dropped so many chances on that occasion.

The chase was not entirely straightforward for South Africa, who were 2 for 21 after losing both openers early, and wobbled towards the end as Josh Hazlewood completed his first five-wicket haul in ODI cricket.

Ultimately the difference was in the fortunes of Bailey and de Villiers: Bailey was dropped four times on his way to 70; de Villiers made a chanceless 80, then was run out in a mix-up with a tail-ender. The loss of de Villiers ended any hope South Africa had of overtaking Australia's 8 for 300. Never before had a team made that many to win a one-day international at the WACA, and in the end South Africa didn't get especially close.

Another underwhelming crowd - this time 24,187 against a capacity of about 80,000 - confirmed that cricket is more readily appreciated on television than at the ground in early November, irrespective of the format, but Australia's steady improvement after a heavy loss in the first match in Adelaide was a vindication of a somewhat experimental squad and their interim coach Trevor Bayliss. White is not yet a part of Australia's ODI squad with the World Cup now a matter of months away, but Mark Waugh, the selector on duty, could file a glowing report of his cool head to seal this result when others, including Glenn Maxwell and Shane Watson, may have chosen wiser strokes in pursuit of a modest total. Handy stands with Maxwell and James Faulkner, who also bowled neatly in helping restrict South Africa to a mere 6 for 145, allowed White and Australia to creep within sight, though the late wickets of Pat Cummins and Sean Abbott left South Africa in with a chance of stealing a tie or even a win.

Cameron Boyce, Pat Cummins and James Faulkner were all key members of the attack and left little work for the batsmen, who cruised past their target for the loss of only three wickets, with 44 balls remaining. A slightly disappointing crowd of 21,415 saw their fellow Victorian Aaron Finch register his first home victory as the national T20 captain as he steered the chase with an unbeaten 44 from 30 deliveries. Ben Dunk was promoted to open with Finch and moved to 23 from 20 balls before he was caught at mid-on off Wayne Parnell, who also picked up the wicket of Shane Watson for 30.

Three days after they were comfortably beaten by a Cricket Australia Invitational XI in Sydney, the tourists combined impressively with ball and bat to deliver Australia's third consecutive international defeat, albeit against two distinctly different teams in two vastly different formats on opposite sides of the globe. The likes of David Warner, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell were missed by the Australians, but it must also be acknowledged that Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers were among South Africa's absentees.

Hazlewood's recovery from full-body cramps to prise out India on the second morning set-up the match, and the combined efforts of the new captain Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Chris Rogers, Starc and Nathan Lyon ultimately allowed the hosts to overwhelm India by a greater margin than the first Test in Adelaide. For Smith it was a significant triumph, emerging victorious after a first day he described among the toughest he had ever endured, as either player or captain. MS Dhoni's men were adequately placed to fight their corner when day four began, but they crumbled in the face of concerted pace and pressure from Johnson on a pitch that had begun to deteriorate.

India's champion was Virat Kohli, a debutant captain with his sight fixed on a formidable target while all but one of his team-mates failed to show similar steel.

In a heated finale, Glenn Maxwell needed four runs from the last ball for victory and was frustrated by a long conference held by several Sri Lanka players before the delivery was bowled, and when Perera sent down the ball wide of off Maxwell missed and all the batsmen could manage was a bye. The Sri Lanka players were jubilant but there were tense scenes as the players walked off, Maxwell clearly annoyed at the Sri Lankans, and even the handshakes involving players who weren't on the field at the end became testy. It became that kind of night when rain interrupted Australia's chase of 162 and despite the shower being short, the umpires did not allow play to restart for 45 minutes due to difficulties drying the outfield. When the rain arrived after 10 overs, Australia were 15 runs behind on the Duckworth-Lewis score at 2 for 60.\n",

After their bowlers had been brilliantly supported in the field to restrict Australia to 3 for 137 - of which Warner made no fewer than 90 - the Sri Lankans made a rapid start to the chase and then steadied against the loss of mid-innings wickets to take a 1-0 lead with seven balls to spare. Angelo Mathews showed the cool head that has him marked as his nation's long-term leader to finish off the innings. There were cameos, too, from Kushal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne and Thisara Perera, all of whom will be happy that Sri Lanka cannot now lose this series after also tying the ODI matches. Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera were both exemplary with the ball, though Kulasekara undid much of his good work by turfing the simplest of chances at deep midwicket when Warner had made only 69.\n",

In the final game, he made another hundred to save Australia from series defeat and salvage a 2-2 result. Set 248 to win the game and the five-match contest, Sri Lanka struggled early, staged a plucky fightback led by Angelo Mathews, and ultimately fell short as Australia's bowlers backed up the fine work of Hughes, whose unbeaten 138 was all the more important in a batting line-up missing Michael Clarke. Australia's captain had been ruled out due to an ankle injury suffered at training on the day before the match and it left the Australians with a flimsy looking batting order that featured the allrounders Glenn Maxwell and Moises Henriques at Nos. 6 and 7.\n",

Australia's batsmen were again exposed by the moving ball in the hands of Sri Lanka's seamers before the fourth ODI at the SCG was washed out. The Sri Lankan chase was at first delayed, then abandoned due to an outfield tardy in drying, after only 3.2 overs.

Kulasekara took a career-best 5 for 22 as he damned Australia to 74 all out, with the aid of Lasith Malinga, who tore down the tail. Sri Lanka's run chase shaped as a straightforward one, but they lost six wickets before they reached their target, meaning 16 wickets had been lost in the day for 149 runs. Had Australia held early chances off Tillakaratne Dilshan and Lahiru Thirimanne, they may have won early the momentum to spark a heavier collapse, but instead the visitors limped home in the 20th over, with their last recognised batting pair at the crease.

A highly disciplined bowling ensemble laid bare Australian frailty against the seaming ball before Lahiru Thirimanne anchored a comfortable chase on a tacky pitch in the second match of the series at Adelaide Oval. The visitors lost Upul Tharanga in the first over of their chase but were largely untroubled thereafter, as the surface eased after earlier offering helpful seam movement for Sri Lanka's bowlers. Thirimanne reached a deserved century by cutting Xavier Doherty backward of point for the winning runs with eight wickets and 59 balls to spare, having been accompanied for much of the pursuit by an uncharacteristically reserved Tillakaratne Dilshan. Particular praise was also due to Nuwan Kulasekara and Angelo Mathews, who took the new balls and set Australia on the defensive by moving the ball just enough through the air and off the seam, while keeping the runs down.\n",

An Australian outfit led by George Bailey in his 14th ODI and featuring three debutants did what sides captained by Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Shane Watson have not managed to do in the past three one-day international encounters against Sri Lanka at the MCG: win. One of those first-gamers, Phillip Hughes, became the first Australian to score a century on ODI debut and Bailey fell just short of a captain's hundred to drive Australia to 5 for 305, before a series of run-outs derailed Sri Lanka's chase. In the end, the Australians - without Clarke, Watson, David Warner, Michael Hussey and Matthew Wade - cruised to victory by 107 runs. If they can do something similar in the second match in Adelaide on Sunday, it might be hard for the selectors to make too many changes.

Despite the best efforts of his partner Mitchell Johnson to dead-bat the ball with one run needed, Hussey was not able to hit the winning run, instead sprinting through for a single as the ball ran off Johnson's thick edge and away to point off Rangana Herath.

Australia's resistance over that period arrived too late to change the result, but in it may be found the clues to a tighter contest when the second match begins in Hyderabad on Saturday. MS Dhoni, R Ashwin, Virat Kohli and Tendulkar were the pivotal contributors to India's 1-0 series lead, showing greater discipline and awareness of the sort of cricket best played on the MA Chidambaram Stadium's clay court. Save for Michael Clarke's first-day century and James Pattinson's fiery pace, it was not until Moises Henriques stood up with the bat in the second innings that the tourists showed evidence of catching up. A target of only 50 to win was reached with the help of some Tendulkar fireworks - towering sixes from his first two deliveries against Nathan Lyon - but Pattinson again bowled well to the openers and Lyon showed far greater consistency of line and control of length than he had managed while being taken for 3 for 215 in the first innings.\n",

For much of the second half of this game, it appeared that Charles was going to ride his luck and steer West Indies to victory but not even his maiden century could end 16 years of Australian dominance at home. Under the captaincy of Shane Watson and without several of their best players, Australia completed a 5-0 clean-sweep thanks largely to Adam Voges and his first international hundred. Voges scored an unbeaten 112 that rescued Australia from a shaky start after they were sent in by Darren Sammy and they were able to post 5 for 274, a very competitive total given the absence of the injured Michael Clarke, David Warner and George Bailey, as well as Matthew Wade and Glenn Maxwell, who have already flown to India for the Test series.

Another fluent innings from Watson set the hosts on the path to a leisurely five-wicket victory over the West Indies at the SCG, thus extending the series ledger to 4-0 in favour of Michael Clarke's team as they begin to be fragmented by departures for the imminent tour of India. Forming important early stands with Aaron Finch and Phillip Hughes, Watson showed there was little bowling joy to be found in a pitch on which the visitors earlier slipped to 6 for 55. Kieron Pollard's admirable rearguard had dragged the visitors' tally to 220 and at least ensured the lights would be required before 18,161 spectators watched Australia strolling home with 31 balls to spare.

The 39-run victory sealed the series for the hosts, but they were as satisfied by the fact that minus the distraction of allround duties Watson was able to sail to three figures on an amiable pitch. His free-scoring was followed up by a contrasting innings from Phillip Hughes, scratchy early but sublime later, while George Bailey clattered 44 from a mere 22 balls before leaving the field with a tight hamstring in the evening.

Two days later, Australia were sent in at the same ground and were 6 for 98. Another short day's play loomed. But George Bailey's maiden international century changed all of that and drove Australia to a scarcely believable 7 for 266 - after the match he said he had considered anything more than 200 a bonus - and Mitchell Starc's second consecutive five-wicket haul confirmed Australia's 54-run victory.

That they can produce batsmen who give it an almighty thump there is no doubt. Aaron Finch, the 26-year-old Victorian, ransacked England's bowling with an eye-popping world record 156 as Australia secured their first victory in any format for 200 days. It was a ferocious display of hitting from Finch, who had six previous T20 caps, as he tore England's attack to shreds with a brutal display, in the process going well past Brendon McCullum's 123 as the highest score in an international Twenty20. Australia's eventual 248 for 6 was the second-highest total in a T20 international - and the highest in a match involving two Test nations - only Sri Lanka's 260 against Kenya was out of reach and for a while it appeared they may cross that landmark too.\n",

Then, with England needing 21 runs from four overs with six wickets in hand, a capacity crowd in a state of high excitement and Clarke no longer fancying a game of cricket quite as much anymore, the umpires took out their light meters and they all walked off.

As happened 32 years ago, Australia tossed away day upon day of diligent cricket with a crowded hour or so of batting calamity, against bowling of high quality from an England team that had looked momentarily bereft of inspiration. Where in 1981 Bob Willis and Ian Botham had rained blows on their antipodean rivals, this time it was Stuart Broad, aided by a critical cameo from Tim Bresnan. Back then, England had been marshalled expertly by Mike Brearley; now it was Alastair Cook who pulled the right rein by replacing Graeme Swann with Bresnan when Australia were 167 for 2 and hurtling towards 299 to win.

The retention of the urn arrived formally via the underwhelming circumstances of an announcement that play had been abandoned at 4.39pm local time, due to a solid belt of rain that could delay its arrival no further than three balls into the afternoon session. By that time England had lurched to 37 for 3, Ian Bell stung on the thumb by a prancing delivery from Peter Siddle that rather summed up the danger posed by a committed and skilful Australian attack, who have grown increasingly confident in their ability to snip the top off their opponents' batting.

Watson's 143 provided nearly half of Australia's total and his stand of 163 with Michael Clarke, who battled through with his troublesome back, was the defining period of the match and series. England's chase only ignited when Ravi Bopara and Jos Buttler were adding 92 in 13 overs; perhaps it was the autumnal chill which descended and left spectators huddle up in jacks that prevented an early spark. But by then it was a monumental task, even for Buttler's nerves of steel.

On a surface where free-scoring was a rarity England struggled in their chase of 228, dented early on by Clint McKay's hat-trick, but just when the requirement was getting out of hand Buttler and Ben Stokes produced a strong argument as to why they have packed the batting order. Buttler had earlier been given out lbw on 8 but was saved by the DRS when it showed the ball sliding down the leg side. When the seventh-wicket pair joined forces England still needed 84 off 68 balls but overs 39 to 43 brought 40 runs as the equation started to favour the home side.

A graceful first hundred against England in one-day internationals was followed by an overwhelming victory. For Australia's captain, it was a rare visit this summer to the pleasure palace. England's pursuit of 316 for victory was a non-event, their defeat every bit as comprehensive as the 88-run margin indicates.

Their batsmen powered their side over 300 on a slow and, at times, uneven pitch. Their fast bowlers then extracted appreciable bite from the same pitch and used the short ball intelligently to finish the contest by the end of the batting Powerplay. Tellingly, India have never successfully chased 300-plus against Australia, and this was their 11th failed attempt, this time against a side lacking several first-choice players.

Australia pushed their score up to 5 for 216 after a shaky start and the total remained unchanged under Duckworth-Lewis, but it was the sort of target India should have felt was achievable. But two early wickets to Mitchell Starc, followed by a pair of strikes in Clint McKay's first over left India expecting too much of MS Dhoni and the lower order.\n",

Ravindra Jadeja provided the spark - and did no harm to his chances in Saturday's IPL auction - with a pair of run-outs as Australia's batsmen were constricted by intense pressure from the fielders, and were dismissed in the 20th over for 131. That was always going to be hard to defend and so it proved, India reaching the target with two balls to spare and eight wickets in hand to draw the series 1-1. They began the chase needing only a fraction above six an over and as a result spent much of their innings in cruise control, Gautam Gambhir able to amble along at less than a run a ball without ever letting the pressure build. The only time a hint of worry might have entered the Indian camp was when five dot balls came towards the end of the chase, and George Bailey had all his fielders in the ring in the final over with one run required.\n",

Watched by a crowd of 59,659, the largest ever for a cricket match in Sydney, Australia's new Twenty20 captain George Bailey enjoyed the winner's plaudits in his first match, just as Dave Gregory had done in the very first Test in 1877 when he was the last Australian to make his debut as captain. His ingenuity in the field rather contrasted with India's captain, MS Dhoni. In the penultimate over, with the target well out of reach, Dhoni's bat flew from his hands as he attempted to make a defiant swing at Brett Lee. The tour has gone the same way, and it did not improve in the format of the IPL.\n",

Dwayne Smith and Johnson Charles started the day with a strong, aggressive opening partnership and despite Australia's bowlers fighting back to dismiss West Indies for 160, it proved to be sufficient for the hosts as Australia's batsmen stalled in the chase after David Warner's quick opening. Too much was left for the final few overs for Australia, who needed 50 from the last five overs and then 19 from the last six balls, bowled by Dwayne Bravo. David Hussey was the only specialist batsmen left at the crease but he couldn't launch the boundaries required off Bravo, who picked up two wickets in that final over as Australia fell well short of their target. Hussey was caught at deep midwicket for 19 trying to clear the boundary and Clint McKay was bowled next ball by Bravo, who finished with 2 for 27 from his four overs and changed the course of the match by running out Warner with a direct hit from side-on.\n",

Kieron Pollard's 20-ball fifty, the fastest by a West Indian player in a Twenty20 international, proved to be in vain as the target of 151 was easily overhauled by the Australians with 11 balls to spare. West Indies were left to rue their slow start, and in particular their struggle to rotate the strike in the first half of their innings after Darren Sammy won the toss and chose to bat. It was not until Pollard arrived at the crease that their run-rate started to lift but he ran out of time, finishing unbeaten on 54 from 26 deliveries, and Australia's innings was more complete than that of their opponents.

That was the outcome after Australia's best all-round performance of the tour so far finished in a 30-run win, although the West Indies captain Darren Sammy did his best to carry the hosts home on his shoulders with a powerful 84 that gave his team unexpected hope. But in the end, Australia had more performers: half-centuries to David Warner, Shane Watson and Peter Forrest set up a big total of 281 for 9 and Brett Lee led a disciplined bowling display to wrap up the victory. It left the series with a sense of symmetry: it began with an Australian win, then a West Indian victory, then a tie, then a West Indies win and ended as it started, with an Australian victory.

Pollard produced a memorable display of power hitting, 102 slugged from 70 balls to vanquish an Australian side that West Indies had come to regard as virtually unbeatable. After a demoralising run against Australia of 13 defeats in 14 ODIs (the other being a no-result), West Indies now have two wins and a tie from their last three games. No side had ever scored more on this ground batting second than West Indies' 284 for 5 to beat England in 2004 and Australia had little chance to buck the trend once they had lost half their side for 112. That they got so close owed much to a considered half-century by David Hussey and a wrathful late assault by Brett Lee, who was struck on the arm by a beamer from Kemar Roach and, despite fulsome apologies, was sore enough in mind and body to take 24 from Roach's next over, following three fours with two sixes flayed over long-on.\n",

Tuesday had been declared a public holiday in St Vincent and a sold-out crowd was kept on its feet throughout as the two sides finished locked on 220 apiece on a pitch almost as lively for spin bowling as for dancing at the boundary's edge. The West Indies needed only one run from the final three deliveries to be bowled by Brett Lee, but a mix-up between the captain Darren Sammy and the last man Kemar Roach saw both stranded at the striker's end as Lee broke the stumps at his. However, the hosts' fight to level the scores having been mired as deeply as 78 for 5 will provide plenty of belief for Sammy's men, while also showing Australia's players that they cannot afford to misstep quite so badly as they have done at times in the three matches so far. This time the fault lay with the batsmen, who squandered the best of the conditions and failed completely to cope with the crafty spin of Sunil Narine.\n",

Set the Duckworth/Lewis-adjusted target of 158 from 40 overs after holding Australia to 154 for 9, the hosts made the worst possible start when Kieran Powell shouldered arms to Brett Lee's first ball of the innings and was palpably lbw. But from an uncertain 74 for 4, Pollard and Dwayne Bravo constructed the most assured stand of the match, and took West Indies to a deserved win with five wickets and 11 balls to spare.

After the debutant George Bailey top scored in Australia's 204 for 8, a total that was difficult to assess at the halfway point on a sluggish pitch, West Indies capitulated to be all out for 140, and their failure was all the more disappointing for the self-inflicted nature of several of the dismissals. Batting was clearly not easy on a surface with such little pace, but too few of the West Indian batsmen showed the discipline required to stick around and chip away at the target. Darren Sammy displayed some late fight and compiled a 36-run partnership for the last wicket with Kemar Roach, but until that point they had lost their previous six wickets for seven runs.

Instead, Michael Clarke's second five-wicket haul in Tests helped the Australians wrap up a 75-run victory and they took the series 2-0, despite some powerful striking from the West Indies captain Darren Sammy. It took Australia two hours on the fifth morning to take the five wickets that remained after the critical breakthrough in the last over of the fourth day, when Shivnarine Chanderpaul was lbw.

Set 192 to win in two sessions, the Australians started their chase slowly and were almost derailed by middle-order wickets, but Michael Hussey's calm and rational approach ensured they narrowly outpaced the setting sun to win by three wickets. In a tense conclusion, Hussey was bowled by Kemar Roach for 32 from 26 balls with three runs still required, but Ryan Harris and Ben Hilfenhaus saw the Australians home and denied West Indies a satisfactory outcome despite them dominating the first three days.

First blood in the NatWest series went to England, but the match felt closer than the final 15-run margin would indicate. Australia's chances departed with their captain, Michael Clarke, who had made 61 from 67 balls when he walked across his stumps, not for the first time, and was aghast to fall plumb lbw to a swinging, low full toss from Tim Bresnan.

The frenzied conclusion of Pakistan's innings contrasted with the composure shown by Michael Clarke's team, who took a major step towards preserving an unbeaten record against the subcontinental side that has lasted since 2002.

Watson picked up two wickets to help restrict South Africa and then crunched 70 from 47 balls to set up their successful chase of 147, as the Australians cruised to victory with 14 balls to spare. The South Africans were lacklustre with the bat and sloppy in the field, and while the result has not yet knocked them out of the tournament, they will need other results to fall their way if they are to progress to the semi-finals. For that to happen, Pakistan would need to lose to both India and Australia, and South Africa would need to beat India and then hope their net run-rate was good enough to sneak them ahead of Pakistan and India. By the same token, the win has not technically confirmed Australia's place in the semi-finals, but their very strong net run-rate meant that for them to miss out, not only would India need to beat both Pakistan and South Africa but Australia would also need a disaster in their last match against Pakistan.\n",

Who'd be able to tell? Watson has hardly given any of his team-mates a chance so far in this tournament, and that continued in Australia's first Super Eights match as they crushed India by nine wickets in Colombo. To be fair, David Warner was also outstanding and Pat Cummins played a key role with the ball. But Watson was again the stand-out performer, as he has been in all of Australia's matches in the World Twenty20. Chasing 141, the Australians reached their target with 31 balls to spare.\n",

Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels both scored quick half-centuries to put up a hefty score of 191 but a strong start from Australia, who reached 100 for 1, was enough to ensure they were ahead when the rain started bucketing down in the tenth over of the chase. On a day when South Africa and Sri Lanka's match was reduced to an absurd seven-over-a-side battle, this game had all the ingredients for a thriller until the weather intervened. Australia were pursuing what would have been the fifth-highest successful run chase in T20 international history, while West Indies at the halfway mark appeared well-placed to open their campaign with a victory.

Ireland had fancied their chances of upsetting Australia, but were left with their odds of progression diminished and their ears ringing from a few verbal barbs delivered by opponents in no mood to be accommodating to a team they had briefly been ranked below on the ICC's T20 rankings earlier this month. Watson influenced proceedings from the first ball of the match, a bouncer Ireland's captain Will Porterfield hooked to fine leg. He returned to the bowling crease to snuff out a mid-innings revival, then smashed 51 to ensure a modest chase that never assumed anything more than nuisance dimensions. Mitchell Starc and Hogg also delivered telling spells to help keep Ireland quiet, their 20 overs devoid of sustained momentum save for a rearguard stand of 50 between Kevin and Niall O'Brien from the depths of 33 for 4.\n",

The only resistance came during a 31-run stand for the fourth wicket between captain Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson.

David Warner and Shane Watson set up the victory with an Australian-record opening partnership before Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc ran through Pakistan, who suffered their worst defeat in a T20 international and were all out for 74, their lowest total in the format. Pakistan still won the series 2-1 but if the old sporting clich? that you're only as good as your last performance can be trusted, the Australians will be reasonably happy when they arrive in Sri Lanka in the next few days for the ICC World Twenty20. The fact that Warner and Watson both fired and found their six-hitting rhythm would be especially pleasing for the captain George Bailey, although some more runs from the middle order would have been preferable. Cummins was outstanding with the new ball as Pakistan slumped to 19 for 5 in the chase, and Brad Hogg's 1 for 11 - the most economical four-over spell by an Australian in a T20 international - was another positive sign for the Australians.\n",

Pakistan claimed the series against Australia, but did so in circumstances as far removed from the hiding dealt out in the first match as could be imagined. Mohammad Hafeez's team celebrated their victory in the minutes after midnight in Dubai, yet George Bailey's Australians could also take solace from a much-improved display. Two days after being routed for 89 on the way to a seven-wicket hiding, Australia scrapped to an enthralling tie. They owed much to the captain George Bailey, who on his 30th birthday compiled the most critical and substantial innings of his T20 career to date, proving his worth as a batsman as well as a captain in the process.\n",

Not since the second T20 international ever played had Australia scored as few in an innings as the 89 for which they were dismissed in this match, and although Pakistan lost three wickets in the chase they were never in danger of losing. They cruised to the target with 31 balls to spare. Statistics don't always mean much in T20 but the story of this match could be summed up with a few numbers.

It was a result achieved as much by perspiration as inspiration, Michael Hussey and the nerveless tyro Glenn Maxwell forming the critical union to rescue their team from the uncertainty of 159 for 5 when Matthew Wade fell to Abdur Rehman. Michael Hussey could so easily have been out lbw to Saeed Ajmal before he had scored, amid a mesmerising spell in which the offspinner claimed what appeared a pivotal 3 for 11. But Misbah-ul-Haq made a pair of judgements that were to prove too timid - failing to refer the umpire Billy Bowden's decision, and then taking Ajmal off after five overs when another wicket or two might have sealed Australia's fate.

Matthew Wade's departure in the eighth over of Australia's reply to 205 for 4 left George Bailey's team at a forlorn 43 for 6, their campaign collapsing in a few fevered minutes. Bailey was left to offer his team's last gesture of defiance, a breathless 63 from 29 balls, but it served only to narrow the margin. That they were chasing such a tall tally was down to Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard.

South Africa embossed their No. 1 ranking with a fearful hiding of Australia in the series-deciding third Test in Perth, and not even the torrent of goodwill sent Ricky Ponting's way on his final day as an international cricketer could prevent resounding confirmation that the hosts remain a long way short of genuine aspirations to be the best team in the world.\n",

And just as Duminy did on debut in Perth four years ago, du Plessis has grabbed his first chance at Test cricket to provide a remarkable result for the South Africans.

The loss of Saturday's play due to persistent rain deprived the match of enough time for a result given the benign nature of curator Kevin Mitchell's pitch, but Michael Clarke's team will depart Brisbane with the kind of spring in their step that England took from the Gabba after a similar recovery at the outset of the 2010-11 Ashes. Such confidence will be derived as much from how James Pattinson and Peter Siddle discomforted South Africa's batsmen on the final afternoon as from the way Clarke, Ed Cowan and Michael Hussey dominated the visiting bowlers.

The fall of Sri Lanka's seventh wicket, fittingly to a short-pitched ball, meant the end of the contest, as none of Prasanna Jayawardene, Chanaka Welegedara or Kumar Sangakkara were fit to bat. Sangakkara had suffered a suspected finger fracture at the hands of the man of the match Mitchell Johnson, who began the day by guiding Australia's tail to a lead of 304 and ended it as the chief inflictor of pain on a Sri Lankan team that was overwhelmed even more comprehensively than India had been last year.\n",

At last Australia have tasted victory this summer. It took until the fourth Test of their home campaign, and into the final hour at that, but Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle delivered a 137-run win for Clarke and their team-mates as Sri Lanka's tail-enders narrowly failed to hold on for a draw at Bellerive Oval.

The top order was rocked by the pace of Brett Lee, then John Hastings removed the key pair of Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell before the innings subsided rapidly to give Australia their first piece of silverware since March last year.

The tourists began the game needing to win and the scenario won't change when they head to Brisbane for Sunday's fifth ODI, but they have been boosted by an end to four consecutive limited-overs losses. Trott's perfectly timed 102 off 126 balls stood tall on a day that was meant to be a celebration of all things Australia, but the home supporters left unhappy as the series score-line in the seven-game contest settled at 3-1. Trott, bowling his steady medium pace, even managed the valuable breakthroughs of Cameron White (44) and David Hussey (28) to end the pair's rescue act.

Marsh's 110 rescued the hosts from two collapses, then England put together a poor run chase as Doug Bollinger completed a fine all-round match with four wickets. Australia's top order slumped to 4 for 33 and, following a 100-run stand between Marsh and Cameron White, they slipped to 8 for 142, before Marsh turned the game on its head. But his matchwinning effort wouldn't have been possible without Bollinger, who showed previously unknown batting prowess to hit 30 in an Australia record ninth-wicket stand of 88. Marsh was given a life on 61 when Ajmal Shahzad dropped a return chance and went from 84 to 101 in the space of one Michael Yardy over, the 45th of the innings, with two boundaries through midwicket followed by a six in the same direction to bring up his hundred from 101 balls.\n",

In his second game for his country, the hometown batsman Aaron Finch muscled a promising unbeaten half-century that pushed the total to 7 for 147, and the seamers held their nerve to give Cameron White his first victory as Australia's captain. In another tense finale after the final-ball thriller in Adelaide, England needed 13 off the last three deliveries, and Chris Woakes slammed Brett Lee over long-on for a crowd-silencing six that made the equation seven from two balls. But Woakes and Tim Bresnan couldn't repeat the dose against the pace of Lee, who bowled short at the end, and Australia's four-run win was confirmed with a pair of singles.

Woakes finished unbeaten on 19 from 15 balls as he struck the final ball over midwicket having lost Graeme Swann at the start of the last over with four needed. Ajmal Shahzad faced two dot balls before scrambling to the non-striker's end then Woakes scythed Shane Watson, who produced an outstanding all-round display with 59 and four wickets, through backward point to level the scores and ensure, at worst, England couldn't lose. They really shouldn't have pushed it so close having always been in control of the asking rate, but it's a credit to their belief that they could still pull through for victory despite a late clatter of wickets.

It wasn't a high-quality match, with the exception of the batting from Adam Voges and David Hussey, as a long season drew to a close with two patched-up sides on show. However, Australia's depth came to the fore again as Voges hit a career-best 80 before England's mentally-finished top order was blown away to end hopes of a face-saving win. Nothing will compensate for the crushing loss in the Ashes series, but Australia's resurgent one-day form has suggested a fourth consecutive World Cup title isn't out of reach, especially if key players return from injury. Even taking into account England's own injury problems and declining form, the home side's performances have boded well in the absence of Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey and Nathan Hauritz - all key figures in the one-day side.\n",

However, it was a tense finish after Clarke was run out for 82 with seven needed but John Hastings and Brett Lee held their nerve to see the home side across the line and leave a weary England with plenty of soul-searching to do That will be particularly true of Jonathan Trott, who was involved in key pieces of action in the closing stages after earlier scoring a career-best 137 to anchor England's highest score in Australia and their highest total in a defeat. Then, in the space of five balls, he lost and almost won the match with two contrasting pieces of fielding. Firstly he failed to hold onto Clarke's clip at short fine-leg which burst through his hands for four, but he then produced a pin-point throw to find the Australian captain short as he came back for a second. It was the third wicket to fall quickly with Australia faltering as the target approached.\n",

On a dry pitch, aiding turn, India couldn't remove a wonderfully solid Ponting, but found a way around him to hold Australia to a competitive 260. Tendulkar set the base and the middle order threatened to choke, but Yuvraj played a blinder to charge India to a famous win. Sometimes, they say, one four can change things around.

An impressive display in the field laid the foundations as the reigning champions were bundled out for 176 on a difficult surface, their lowest total in a World Cup since 1992, and despite a mighty effort from Brett Lee Pakistan were guided home by Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq. Despite not having either team's progression at stake, the final group positions determine quarter-final opposition while momentum is also a factor.

Though the margin of victory - seven wickets with 91 balls to spare - was huge, they did not have it easy throughout. Canada ambushed them with the bat, and then created some chances with the new ball. Australia's pace and power eventually swamped them but Ashish Bagai's team exceeded expectations in their final World Cup appearance. When Bagai chose to bat, the probability of an early finish in Bangalore increased significantly, but Australia's inevitable supremacy was delayed by an extraordinary attack from 19-year-old Hiral Patel, who batted fearlessly to score a rapid half-century off the world's fastest bowlers.\n",

An upset was never on the cards but Kenya put in their best performance of the tournament with the highlight being the 115-run stand between Obuya and Tanmay Mishra. The imposing run chase had been set up by a 114-run partnership between Michael Clarke and the returning Michael Hussey in his first innings of the World Cup. It actually gave Australia some important breathing space, but Kenya had long-since given up any hope of chasing down 325 on the ground where Ireland shocked England earlier in the tournament.

Michael Hussey's century and another Shane Watson blitz set Australia on the path to their fourth-highest ODI total of all time, and while the final margin of 66 runs may appear comfortable, Bangladesh put up a feisty chase. The hosts needed 362 for victory, which even their most ardent fans must have felt was unachievable after they managed only 210 and 229 in the first two matches. But Imrul Kayes and his top-order colleagues gave the Mirpur crowd something to cheer about, pushing the score to 179 for 1 with 20 overs remaining, and Clarke was scratching his head for an answer. It came in the form of the debutant fast bowler James Pattinson, who picked up his first wicket for his country - not the same country his brother Darren represented - when Kayes edged behind for 93, and the required run-rate crept into unrealistic territory.\n",

The target of 230 had appeared a possible banana skin on a slow pitch offering some turn, but Watson made such light work of it, that his unbeaten185 from 96 balls now stands as the highest ODI score by an Australian, overtaking Matthew Hayden's 181 against New Zealand in 2007.

Australia have a 1-0 lead in the three-match series and while the results might seem inconsequential after the World Cup, the subplot of Clarke taking over the leadership from Ricky Ponting has created some interest. Clarke's 101 suggested that the responsibility could sit well with him, and he needed to anchor the innings after Australia lost three wickets in their first 14 overs having been sent in on a good batting pitch. He helped get the Australians to a strong total of 270 for 7 and Bangladesh, who only twice in their ODI history have successfully chased totals of that size, were not up to the task.

His determined and at times handsome innings also served to cloud Australia's spin bowling plans for the first Test at Galle, as neither Michael Beer nor Nathan Lyon were able to pose too great a threat on a pitch that offered sizeable rough and some sharp turn. The Australians had been bowled out for 393, the captain Michael Clarke retiring after a suave 104, before the Board XI sailed smoothly to 174 for 2 by the time the teams agreed to an early close at about 4pm local time.

Australia might have won the series 3-2 but with the first Test just over a week away, it was important for Sri Lanka to finish on a high, and they did that through Malinga with the ball, and then Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva with the bat.

After two substandard batting performances in the opening matches, Sri Lanka finally found their rhythm and their 286 was too tall a target for Australia, who lead 2-1 as the teams head to Colombo for the final two games in the series. It was a solid all-round performance from Sri Lanka: Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara contributed useful runs and the work of the batsmen was well backed up by the outstanding Malinga and his bowling colleagues. Especially impressive was the debutant seamer Shaminda Eranga, who struck in his first over and deceived Ricky Ponting to keep Australia on the back foot early in their chase.

All this after Shane Watson's belligerent 57 from 24 balls seemed to have set the visitors up for a series-levelling victory.

Dilshan hammered 67 from his final 23 deliveries, a sequence that effectively decided the match.

Another day's play could have been a useful tune-up before the team heads to Cape Town, but there were only a few men who failed to make the most of the game. Mitchell Johnson showed signs of his best form with a nine-wicket match-haul, Shane Watson muscled his way to 77 in the second innings, Shaun Marsh scored a pair of half-centuries, Peter Siddle made a strong case for Test selection, Michael Clarke was fluent in his first-innings 76 and Nathan Lyon improved as the match went on. But Phillip Hughes and Ricky Ponting would have wanted more time in the middle and Trent Copeland's lack of penetration may have put him in danger of losing his spot. However, a seven-wicket victory was an encouraging result for the Australians, who were set 212 to win on the third day, after Johnson's five-wicket haul in the second innings, and they got there with ease.\n",

James Pattinson, Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle made a fearful mess of India's batting, sharing nine wickets between them to bring a swift conclusion to a match that had fluctuated often over the course of the previous three days. In doing so they finished with the ball what had started with the bat - Australia's tail deflated India in the morning by stretching the target to 292. Pattinson's contribution on his home ground was telling, first stroking an unbeaten 37 then firing out Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman while also softening up Sachin Tendulkar for Siddle, who claimed him with his first ball after relieving the younger Victorian. The end arrived 70 minutes after tea, Australia claiming a 1-0 series lead in their quest to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n",

The hosts' chase of 241 had been guided expertly by David Warner, but Bracewell's removal of Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey, all on 159, left Australia a nervous 5 for 173 at lunch, and on resumption the remaining five went down for a mere 60. In all it was a collapse of 8 for 74, Warner left marooned on 123 when the last man, Nathan Lyon, was bowled by Bracewell. Bracewell's display, characterised by swing, bounce and sharp variation, confirmed his pre-series billing by the New Zealand captain Ross Taylor as a cricketer of enormous potential. It also branded Australia as a team of profound vulnerability with the bat, a problem made doubly vexing by the fact the top seven is populated as much by experience as callow youth.\n",

He is also the third Australia bowler after Nathan Lyon and Pat Cummins to achieve the feat in 2011. Pattinson's haul of 5 for 27 is the second-best bowling performance by an Australia bowler against New Zealand in Tests in Brisbane after Dennis Lillee's 6 for 53 in 1980.

Having bowled out Pakistan for 212, Australia were made to fight every inch for the two-wicket win that handed Pakistan their second 5-0 sweep in history. Fittingly, it was Michael Hussey, Australia's most valuable player for a scrap, who steered them home with an unbeaten 40.

Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz starred with the bat, before Ryan Harris tore through the batting with a second successive five-for to set up a crushing 135-run win. Remarkably, given how poor Pakistan have been in this country, this was Australia's first win over them in an ODI in Perth. Pakistan's tour has been one long, dark and miserable spiral since the fourth day of the second Test in Sydney and it continued with another dispirited, stuttering performance. They did battle in the field but let Australia get away at a critical stage once again, and contrasting fifties from Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz then took them to 277.\n",

Workmanlike half-centuries from Shaun Marsh and Michael Clarke, and a late Michael Hussey blitz, set up Australia's 6 for 286 before Harris grabbed 5 for 43 to confirm Australia's win. It was a remarkable effort from Harris, who finished up as the Man of the Match having only been called into the squad late on match eve as cover for Peter Siddle, who had a sore back. He began with a wicket in his first over and returned with three in two overs during the batting Powerplay when Afridi and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan were giving Pakistan hope of a famous fightback.

After being led by Shane Watson and Cameron White in their 6 for 267, the hosts delivered a stinging bowling display to knock over the tourists for 127 in 37.3 overs.

McCullum became the second-highest scorer in a Twenty20 international with an unbeaten 116, but after Michael Clarke and Cameron White exploded in the reply the scores were tied at 214 after 40 overs. A six-ball tiebreaker was required and the calm Tim Southee delivered another tight over to allow only six runs for White, David Warner and Brad Haddin.

After an unbeaten home summer the visitors started their tour with another convincing display built on very fast bowling and powerful opening batting. New Zealand were knocked over for 118 by the speed of Shaun Tait, Dirk Nannes and Mitchell Johnson and their chances of defending the small total were basically extinguished as soon as David Warner and Shane Watson blasted 28 from the first two overs.

Warner raced to fifty from 18 deliveries, beating his own 19-ball effort from last season, as Australia reeled in the target of 139 with a ridiculous 50 deliveries to spare. West Indies' total looked semi-competitive until the first over of the chase when Warner and Shane Watson took 26 off Kemar Roach, who bowled too short and allowed Warner to swing through midwicket. There were three sixes in the over - as many as the visitors hit in their entire innings - and the contest was all but decided. By the time Warner had cleared the boundary off Darren Sammy in the second over, he had 33 from eight deliveries and Yuvraj Singh's 12-ball half-century record was conceivably in danger.\n",

Warner provided the early thrills with a brutal batting display before the Man of the Match Tait destroyed West Indies' top order as Australia's plans for the ICC World Twenty20 took a step in the right direction. Warner and Shane Watson lit up Bellerive Oval, which was hosting its first night international, by taking Australia to 0 for 83 in the eighth over and some late fireworks from Brad Haddin pushed them to 8 for 179. It was a good but gettable total, until two wickets in Tait's first over knocked the life out of the chase.

After Ricky Ponting, James Hopes and Shane Watson set up a daunting 5 for 324, Doug Bollinger continued his torment of Chris Gayle and the West Indies top order crumbled - again - to leave the crowd in no doubt about the approaching result less than five overs in to the chase. The 125-run triumph maintained Australia's chances of going through the summer undefeated in all forms of the game, with two Twenty20s against West Indies all that remain. Already they have equalled their effort of 2000-01, the only other home season when they did not lose a Test or ODI.

Ponting's side has out-played both touring teams this summer and the captain stepped up with an outstanding 106 as his side posted a ground-record 324. Even if Chris Gayle had fired his outfit would have found the chase difficult and when he went for 34 off 27 balls the game was gone. Narsingh Deonarine's maiden half-century kept the tourists going for a while before Kieron Pollard showed some muscle with a personal best of 62 and Dwayne Smith chipped in an unbeaten 58.

The desperate tourists, who now have to win the final two matches to level the five-game contest, were hopeful of victory after Ravi Rampaul's 4 for 61 restricted Australia to 225.

The tourists were out-classed by Doug Bollinger in the early stages and slumped to 4 for 16 before scrambling to 170, a total which was never going to be large enough. Australia were not intimidated and Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting skipped to half-centuries as the win came in the 27th over.

Chris Gayle's prediction of a 4-1 West Indies win can still come true but they have only one day to regroup before Tuesday's second match in Adelaide. The result was understandable given the number of stars missing from West Indies' line-up through injury, but disappointing after Kieron Pollard's career-best bowling performance helped peg Australia back following a strong start from Watson and Ricky Ponting.

Tait bowled the fastest ball ever recorded in Australia and grabbed 3 for 13 including the key wicket of Kamran Akmal, who had threatened to end Australia's streak with his highest Twenty20 score. Pakistan's trip has been notable for terrible fielding and the inability to capitalise whenever they got on top of Australia. This time their fielding was sharper than it had been at any stage over the past couple of months but their failure to keep Australia down remained a major issue.

Brendon McCullum's inspired 104 forced the visitors to chase 106, a target they achieved without loss before lunch thanks to Hughes' aggressive 86 off 75 balls. After spending time in the field over four days, Ryan Harris, the debutant, sealed a quick finish of New Zealand's second innings, taking 4 for 77 as the hosts were dismissed for 407.

The 51-run triumph might at least give New Zealand some spark heading in to the Test series, which begins up the road at the Basin Reserve on Friday, and it left the ODI scoreline at 3-2. Ricky Ponting didn't lose a toss for the whole series and again made New Zealand set a target, but this time on a two-paced pitch their 241 for 9 appeared competitive.

Rain played some part in the outcome but it was mostly New Zealand's watered-down batting display that left their fans feeling gloomy and consigned Saturday's fifth match in Wellington to dead-rubber status. The hosts had only themselves to blame for failing to bat out their overs and after rain reduced the target from 239 off 50 overs to 200 from 34 overs, Australia found their way home with 17 balls to spare.

Haddin's 110 was his highest ODI score and he ended Daniel Vettori's hopes of winning what he said before the match was \"the most important game of the series\". Ricky Ponting was annoyed in the opening two games at his batsmen's inability to capitalise on their starts, and they resolved that problem at Seddon Park.

Styris began the day outside New Zealand's starting XI but was called in late due to Daniel Vettori's stiff neck, and the inclusion helped Ross Taylor start his international captaincy career on a high. Styris sealed the win with a six over long-off from the second ball of the 50th over from Doug Bollinger and finished unbeaten on 49 from 34 deliveries. He roared as the ball sailed over the boundary and was pumped up after he and Mitchell Johnson appeared to clash head and helmet in the 46th over, in which Styris slogged two boundaries.

The contest provided little more than a run around for the Australians as they swept past an outfit including their squad mates Daniel Christian, Tim Paine and Nathan Hauritz. Warner, who scored 72 in the loss to Zimbabwe on Tuesday, backed up with 51 off 41 balls and David Hussey raced to 49 to set up Australia's 189 for 8. Clarke (30), Cameron White (24) and Shane Watson (17) also contributed as the side tried to find a successful method to prevent a repeat of last year's first-round exit.

Australia were on track chasing Zimbabwe's 173 for 7 when David Warner smashed 72 off 49 and the captain Michael Clarke took them to the verge of victory with 49 from 42. Australia wanted 13 from the final over but the task became too difficult when Clarke was bowled from the second-last ball by Chris Mpofu. Mitchell Johnson was then run-out from a wide and Brett Lee could only manage a bye from the final delivery.

Despite a brave recovery led by David Hussey, who made 59 from 54 balls, Australia's hopes of claiming the only world title to have eluded them were devastated from the moment they lost three wickets in 13 legitimate deliveries in a stunning start to the contest. Chasing a target of 148, Kieswetter and Pietersen broke the back of the chase in an 11-over alliance, but fittingly it was left to England's captain, Paul Collingwood, to seal the victory with 18 balls to spare. At the moment of victory, he was mobbed by his jubilant team-mates as they poured out of the dug-out, with incredulity and triumph writ large on their features.

In 40 overs Australia re-taught their opponents the lessons of four days in Sydney from earlier this year, the moral of which remains that till the precise moment Australia are out, they are never out. Pakistan were on top for three days in Sydney, and 39 overs here, but Australia hunted away, gripped in, stuck at it. And with one ball to go, they pulled off an astonishing chase of 192 to enter Sunday's final, leaving on Pakistan the deepest kind of scars in an already abusive relationship.

Dirk Nannes and Mitchell Johnson were the main destroyers of the Sri Lankan batting line-up, but the win was made possible by Cameron White's unstoppable 85 from 49 balls, which rescued his side from a perilous 67 for 5. White was ably aided by Michael Hussey in an unbroken stand of 101 in less than ten overs, and when the Sri Lankan top order was bullied out by a formidable Australian pace attack in quick succession, the rest of the batsmen collapsed in a heap. Australia had been in a similar situation against Bangladesh in the group stage, sinking to 65 for 6 before they were saved by a 74-run partnership between Hussey and Steven Smith. Today, they had White to thank, as he saw off the threatening Suraj Randiv, making the most of a missed chance on 23 to establish his dominance over the rest of the attack, as he passed 50 from 32 balls.\n",

Bangladesh's defeat also meant defending champions Pakistan, the team most likely to take the flight home in case Group A was decided on net run-rate, also progressed to the Super Eights.

They wear a fresh look about them in this tournament, under a new captain in Michael Clarke at a global event for the first time since 1999 and with some very handy specialists in the squad. They went about their opening game in merciless fashion, echoing their dominance over Pakistan months earlier. Brutal half-centuries from Shane Watson and David Hussey set them up, before equally brutal pace shoved aside Pakistan's batsmen.

After Graeme Swann's 4 for 37 had limited the Aussies to an eminently gettable 212, England had at one stage been coasting to victory on 185 for 3 with eight-and-a-half overs in hand, but a sensational collapse of six wickets for 18 in 38 balls meant their victory bunting had been somewhat frayed around the edges by the time Tim Bresnan slashed two desperate boundaries in the space of three deliveries to seal a one-wicket victory with five balls to spare. The catalyst for the collapse was the dismissal of Eoin Morgan, England's star finisher from the first two games at the Rose Bowl and Cardiff. He had joined forces with his captain, Andrew Strauss, to take England to the brink of a thumping victory when he swatted a tame pull to midwicket off Steven Smith to give Australia a sniff of an opening.

From Stuart Broad's three early wickets to an impressive Andrew Strauss half-century, to a coasting partnership from Paul Collingwood and Morgan to confirm the result, it was a thoroughly professional victory for the hosts. On a day when Australia installed a Labor prime minister born in Wales, the nation's cricketers laboured in Wales for no such reward.

Morgan's unbeaten 103 was the standout performance of the match, more authoritative than Michael Clarke's anchoring role for Australia, and it was enough to separate two sides that otherwise mirrored each other.

After being made to sweat by Ireland on Thursday this wasn't a comfortable outing, either, as a rusty attack was taken for 273 before the reply slipped to 64 for 4. A little over a month ago Hussey played one of most extraordinary innings imaginable to take Australia home in the World Twenty20 semi-final against Pakistan in St Lucia, while White also played a vital hand in a run chase that seem impossible. The outcome of this match held far less significance and, having steadied the innings from the early wobble, the pair constructed their stand with consummate ease against a weak bowling line-up with the honourable exception of Tim Murtagh.

It was an ODI that was meant to be a warm-up for Ricky Ponting's side, but it was rightly treated as a full-scale international by Ireland and the highly-fancied visitors were almost embarrassed. The captain William Porterfield started the dramatic chase of Australia's 232 by blasting three fours off Ryan Harris' first over and he later pulled a six off Clint McKay during a frenetic 80-run opening partnership with Paul Stirling.

They eventually crept home with three men still standing, but their collective nerves in tatters, as Umar Gul launched the winning shot through the covers with the scores already level. The margin of victory looked more comfortable than it felt, and that's putting it mildly. The eventual difference between the sides was the wicketkeeper, Kamran Akmal, whose 13 from 26 balls was as close as Pakistan came to a composed fourth-day performance.

Set an improbable 440 for victory, Pakistan began their chase boldly through the efforts of Salman Butt, who made a fluent 92 in a 102-run stand for the second wicket with the debutant Azhar Ali, and at 152 for 1 with more than five sessions of the match remaining, there was an outside chance of a miracle taking place. But North's introduction transformed the contest shortly before lunch. With his eyes lighting up as North floated his first delivery gently towards his pads, Butt toppled out of his crease to be stumped down the leg-side by Tim Paine, before Umar Akmal jabbed a lifter to slip on the stroke of lunch.

On their only day of match bowling before the first Test against Pakistan, the Australians took a while to work into their rhythm but gradually chipped away and when play was called off they had Derbyshire at 235 for 5. In his return to the senior Australian side, Ben Hilfenhaus worked hard and was eventually rewarded with the wicket of Dan Redfern, who cut to gully and was caught by a juggling Marcus North.

Again, a vigorous Umar Akmal half-century set up Pakistan's innings but this time their bowlers, led by Mohammad Aamer, did enough to strangle Australia's run-rate and deny Michael Clarke's men, who couldn't chase down 168. In May, it took something special from Michael Hussey to drive Australia into the decider against England, as he monstered the 18 needed off the last over, bowled by Saeed Ajmal.

Getty Images Cricket Australia has apologised to the South Africans for members of the crowd who used a green laser to put off Wayne Parnell in the closing stages of Australia's six-wicket win in Brisbane on Tuesday night. In the 18th over of Australia's pursuit of 5 for 157 Michael Hussey hit a catch to Parnell at long-off, which he dropped, but television replays showed lights flashing from the stands that might have distracted him. \"There was a green flash and it was pretty bright and the light seemed to be pointing towards me,\" Parnell told the Herald Sun. \"It was all a bit strange.

PA Photos David Warner made one of the most memorable international debuts imaginable as he lit up the MCG with 89 from 43 balls to set up Australia's 52-run win over South Africa. Not even a superb 78 from JP Duminy could rescue South Africa's chase and he watched his partners fall around him as they fizzled out for 130 in the 18th over. The crowd appreciated Duminy's brilliance, particularly when he scooped a Shaun Tait half-volley over the wicketkeeper's head for six, but it was Warner who was undeniably the star of the show. It was an incredible situation for a man previously so unknown that the scoreboard operators didn't have a photo of him when the teams were displayed. Warner, 22, had already created history by simply playing the match; he was the first man to debut for Australia in any format without first-class experience since 1877.\n",

PA Photos For the second consecutive year Australia have pulled off a last-minute victory in the Sydney Test, this time despite a courageous and painful batting effort from the injured Graeme Smith. Last season it was Michael Clarke who bowled Australia home nine minutes from stumps and on this occasion Mitchell Johnson picked up the final wicket with five minutes remaining to give Australia a consolation win that left the series ledger a little less lopsided at 2-1. The last breakthrough came when Johnson nipped a ball back off a crack in the wearing pitch to bowl Smith, who had been incredibly gutsy in coming to the crease at No. 11 with a broken left hand and a right elbow so sore he said he could barely brush his teeth in the morning. Smith survived for 29 minutes with Makhaya Ntini as he aimed to salvage a draw but every fast ball he faced drew winces around the ground as he quickly released his left hand and gritted his teeth.\n",

Getty Images Australia clung to the Chappell-Hadlee Series despite a brave push from New Zealand after the final game was spoilt by rain. Martin Guptill's fighting half-century was in vain as the visitors finished at 6 for 123; they were ahead on Duckworth-Lewis but needed to make the target of 156 in 20 overs to qualify the contest as a match. The result left the series drawn at 2-2 and Australia kept the prize after their win in 2007-08. It was a sad end for New Zealand after a day that swung from saturated to soggy and slippery.

Getty Images The Hussey brothers ensured the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy would be decided by Friday's final match in Brisbane after they helped Australia to a six-wicket win that levelled the series 2-2. For the first time in the series New Zealand batted first and they posted a moderate 244, which on a good pitch was not enough against an Australian batting order starting to find form. The game was to some degree overshadowed by the Victorian bushfire appeal that surrounded it, with contributions from players, sponsors, spectators and administrators totalling just over $6 million. But while Australia had failed to beat South Africa at the same venue on Australia Day, this time they did get over the line at Adelaide on another special, if more sombre, occasion.

Getty Images Australia's influx of youth has dominated discussion of late, but it was the team's mainstays who completed a successful series-salvaging mission at the SCG. Brad Haddin's maiden one-day international century was complemented by half-centuries to Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey, propelling Australia to an intimidating 9 for 301 that proved just beyond the grasp of the hard-finishing New Zealand. The hosts appeared set for a comfortable victory at the fall of Tim Southee's wicket in the 37th over, but a brilliant partnership of 69 from 49 deliveries between Grant Elliott, who struck 115 from 124 balls, and the injured Brendon McCullum (36 from 27) raised hopes of a stunning upset.

Getty Images Michael Clarke's 98 could not stop his unthinkable series loss from coming a step closer after Grant Elliott kept a cool head to complete a six-wicket victory for New Zealand, who were solid without being spectacular. Despite making hard work of a less than imposing chase of 226, New Zealand got home with seven balls to spare to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. On a day when the glitzy IPL auction caught the attention of much of the cricketing world, Australia and New Zealand combined to produce a distinctly unglamorous match that was hardly the best advertisement for the 50-over format. It was a throwback to the 1980s, when 220 was considered a good target and top-order men like Geoff Marsh and John Wright were commended for compiling 50 off 90 balls.

Taylor guided the tentative chase of the home team's below-par 181 and carried an order of novices before Daniel Vettori sealed the success with a glide behind point. The timing of New Zealand's batting Powerplay was crucial - it came with eight overs to go - as they went from heading towards a troubling loss to redirecting course.

When Paul Collingwood fell for a monumental 245-ball 74 England still trailed by six, but once Australia had to bat again, valuable time was taken out of the game leaving Andrew Strauss and a packed Cardiff nervously clock-watching.

After North sped the Australians to 438 for 4 at the lunch-time declaration in Worcester, the tourists were pleased to see Johnson remove both openers and Lee gain reverse-swing in the 33rd over before the match was called off almost an hour early. The end was signalled shortly after the umpire Jeff Evans collapsed on the side of the pitch with the England Lions 162 for 4. Johnson was more fluent as he built on a rusty performance in the first innings during a nine-over spell that set him up for Cardiff.

Australia would perhaps rue the fact that they settled for 229 when they batted after winning an important toss. \"A total of 220 should be a good score on this pitch,\" Ponting had said and Australia's approach while batting reflected his mindset. Their bowlers did pick up three quick top-order wickets to leave India wobbling at 53 for 3 but Yuvraj and Dhoni batted with the knowledge that sufficient time spent at the crease would ensure a risk-free victory.

Then, in tandem with Suresh Raina, he ripped the bowling to shreds. MS Dhoni's superb 107-ball 124 was the foundation for India's highest-ever total against Australia, a mammoth 354 for 7, and once Praveen Kumar and Ishant Sharma winkled out Australia's top three for just 45, the match was effectively over. Michael Hussey's 53 provided a lone note of defiance as India romped home by 99 runs, to leave the series all square as the teams packed their bags and headed to Delhi.

Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey set up what looked like being a comfortable Australian win until a lively, crowd-lifting partnership from Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar threatened to snatch victory for India. In the end, nine were required from the final over and Peter Siddle held his nerve to confirm a four-run margin in Australia's favour.

Nathan Hauritz, placed on notice by Australia's selectors prior to the series, claimed his first career five-wicket haul as Pakistan crumbled from 3 for 170 overnight to be all out for 251 shortly after lunch on the final day. Hauritz's ability to exploit wearing pitches had been called into question of late, not least by Andrew Hilditch, and he proved himself worthy of the challenge on Wednesday. Unable to replicate the biting turn that accounted for Faisal Iqbal the previous day, Hauritz instead utilised flight and bounce to challenge Pakistan's lower and middle orders and was rewarded with four final-day scalps.

The result was virtually assured as soon as the day broke sunny, with the hosts wanting one wicket and it came when Kemar Roach was ruled caught behind via an umpiring review. Roach and Gavin Tonge had added 15 when Doug Bollinger and the Australians were certain Roach had got an edge to Brad Haddin.

On a slightly damp pitch in Guwahati, Mitchell Johnson found his mojo and combined with Doug Bollinger to bundle out India for 170 before Shane Watson gave a solid start to the chase to ensure Australia cantered to a series win. Bollinger was at the top of his game today on a track conducive to his style and found his mark immediately, nipping out two wickets early and snapping twin dangerous partnerships later en route to 5 for 35.

In Chennai in 1998-99, Tendulkar, having played an innings as incredible as this, left the last three wickets 17 to get; tonight he left them 19 off 17.

Chasing 222 Australia were cruising as Gilchrist belted 83 from 50 balls, but a collapse of 6 for 16 in ten overs ensured Sri Lanka regained some pride with a 13-run win. It almost turned back Australia's way as Nathan Bracken and Brett Lee combined for a 35-run tenth-wicket stand that brought them within sight of victory, but Sanath Jayasuriya had one final trick in his last match on Australian soil. With 14 needed from two overs, Jayasuriya, who had not been handed the ball until then, came on and bowled Lee (37) first ball to seal the win.

Getty Images A spirited chase led by Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa fell 18 short as Australia celebrated the end of Ricky Ponting's rocky batting patch with a tight victory. While the home side toasted a return to form ahead of Sunday's first final, India's plight to reach the CB Series deciders now comes down to the match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday after they reached 299, a haul relying on Gambhir's second century of the tournament. A horrible series was forgotten by Ponting during his fine 124 while half-centuries to Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds also lifted their clouds of poor form in a brutal team display of 7 for 317. In the face of such a challenge - it was easily the highest total of the series - India were always behind and it was only the performances of Gambhir and Robin Uthappa that kept them in the game after the first four wickets went by the 11th over.

Before the game Jamie Siddons, the Bangladesh coach, said a rusty Australia would still be very good and after they posted a challenging 254, Mitchell Johnson and Brett Geeves troubled the top order to set up the one-sided result. The build-up to the match was remarkably similar to the memorable 2005 contest in Cardiff when Andrew Symonds turned up to the ground under the influence of alcohol, was left out of the match, and Bangladesh scored a five-wicket win. This time Symonds was scratched because he had missed a team meeting due to a fishing trip on Friday, but his colleagues had no intention of letting the incident affect the outcome.

After today's nine-wicket caning in a match lasting only 59 overs the same thought stands. Please can this be the turning point? There is still time for England repairs - the CB Series has just passed the halfway point and, amazingly, they could reach the finals easily - but on this performance they would have been lucky to have achieved anything positive in the World Cup warm-up for the minnows in Kenya. Throughout the tour Andrew Flintoff has spoken proudly about the strong spirit in the dressing room, but his men have been unable to transform the talk and have slumped horribly since a brief change of direction against New Zealand in Hobart. For some reason Adelaide, the most beautiful of grounds, turns England into their ugliest.\n",

Getty Images Michael Hussey again finished a difficult job for his team, taking Australia to victory against New Zealand with two wickets to spare. Hussey's unbeaten 65 was the key in a tight run-chase of 219 and he brought up the win with a six in the 49th over. New Zealand pushed Australia to the very end but their decision to play only four bowlers cost them dearly as Craig McMillan and Nathan Astle proved too easy to score off in the dying overs. McMillan had already done his part with 89 in New Zealand's 219 but Hussey and Michael Clarke (75) earned Australia their fourth win of the series. Clarke's dismissal in the 38th over triggered a mini-collapse as Cameron White and Brett Lee fell soon after and when Nathan Bracken was caught with two runs required the outcome was still uncertain.\n",

Getty Images A committed bowling display led by John Lewis eased England's pain, but it was not enough to prevent another defeat that was set up by a dire batting effort. After England spluttered to 155 all out in 42 overs on a strange surface, the home team copied the mistakes and dropped to 4 for 48 before sweating to a four-wicket victory. Despite gaining an unlikely position of strength through Lewis's three-wicket opening, England again released the pressure and Michael Hussey responded with a match-sealing 46. Hussey worked with Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, who finished on 20 after surviving a torrid spell from Andrew Flintoff, to steer the side out of trouble. However, they were fortunate to claim a bonus point from an encounter that turned out to be relatively even.\n",

Getty Images New Zealand's batsmen were unable to follow up on Shane Bond's hat-trick and fell 105 runs short of Australia's 289 despite Ross Taylor's fighting 84. The visitors lost their final seven wickets for 23 in a disappointing finish after Bond made a memorable impact to close the first innings. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White launched a late onslaught of 90 in nine overs before Bond ended the partnership in the 50th over when White was caught in the deep and Symonds edged behind next ball attempting a huge drive. Bond, who became the second New Zealander to take a one-day international hat-trick and collected 4 for 61, finished the job with a ripper that took the top of Nathan Bracken's off stump, but his team-mates failed to carry the momentum into their batting.

Getty Images Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum blasted New Zealand to another massive run-chase as they negated Matthew Hayden's 181 and inflicted a cleansweep on Australia at Hamilton. The home team flew to 350 with only one wicket to spare on the back of McMillan's 117 and his 165-run partnership with McCullum. Their second-innings 340 at Auckland on Sunday - which was the second-highest chase in ODI history - was bettered again as McMillan showed contempt for the Australia attack despite coming to the crease at 4 for 41. He brought up his first limited-overs century since 2002 with two consecutive sixes off Adam Voges' left-arm orthodox spin, reaching the milestone from only 67 balls, which was the fastest by a New Zealander. He fell with 66 runs needed but McCullum took up the attack and with seven to win off the final over, and with nine wickets down, he launched a Nathan Bracken full toss over midwicket for six from the first ball then slashed behind point for four to win.\n",

Getty Images Australia fell from their No. 1 one-day ranking for the first time as Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Craig McMillan propelled New Zealand to their huge target of 337 with an over to spare to secure the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Taylor's century bettered the one Michael Hussey had made to set up Australia's total, which until New Zealand's chase was the highest ODI score at Eden Park. Taylor built the platform for the second-highest successful chase in limited-overs history with 117 before Fulton, and in particular McMillan, hammered Australia to all parts of the ground in the dying stages.

Getty Images Shane Bond's love of hurting Australia pushed New Zealand to their third win in five years of Trans-Tasman contests and added to the visitors' severe woes. On the day when Australia's under-strength squad was hit further by the loss of Brett Lee and Michael Clarke to injuries, Bond made their situation much worse by capturing 5 for 23 as they toppled to their first ever ten-wicket loss. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming powered past the tiny target of 149 in the 27th over and Australia must win the final two matches of the Chappell-Hadlee Series to hold their No. 1 ranking.

Getty Images England sparked the shock of the season by handing Australia their first home finals defeat for 14 years in a dramatic rain-reduced game at the SCG. On the same ground where a demoralised England handed over the Ashes last month, Andrew Flintoff completed a smaller but highly satisfying clean sweep by taking the CB Series in two games. The Australians were shocked - and probably embarrassed - when they flopped to 5 for 63 in the 12th over chasing a revised total after Paul Collingwood drove England to 8 for 246. Rain offered a brief reprieve for Australia when it came with the match needing another 22 balls for a result, but the sky cleared for long enough and they lost by 34 runs on Duckworth-Lewis when more wet weather arrived. \"To pit our wits against Australia in a final is a great thing for us with a group of young guys,\" Andrew Flintoff said.\n",

Getty Images England recovered from two near-death experiences and Paul Collingwood produced back-to-back centuries to steal the first CB Series final at the MCG. After being dominated by Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting in the afternoon, England fought back to restrict their target to 253 and then dropped to the severe danger of 3 for 15. The situation did not worry Collingwood, who had already taken a brilliant catch and two sharp run-outs, and he combined with Ian Bell, Andrew Flintoff and Paul Nixon to secure the tight win with three balls to spare. Australia were as shocked as England were happy when Collingwood struck the winning run through midwicket to finish with a magnificent 120 from 133 deliveries. With Flintoff (35) and Collingwood in partnership England were confident of winning, but they lost Flintoff and Jamie Dalrymple to require 28 to win in 23 balls.\n",

Getty Images Ricky Ponting quickly returned Australia's winning habit with a calm century and Brad Hodge sealed his short-term future with an unbeaten 99 as they beat New Zealand by five wickets. Chasing a ground-record target of 291, Australia started slowly before warming up through a two-paced partnership of 154 between Hodge and Ponting that forced New Zealand to fight with England on Tuesday for a spot in the finals. After missing the 92-run loss on Friday - the first of Australia's summer - Ponting was determined to prevent another defeat and he produced a superb performance against a testing attack. Hodge, who replaced the injured Andrew Symonds, had scores of 0 and 1 in his two previous appearances and arrived to a \"pressure cooker\" atmosphere, but he walked off his home ground having hit the final runs. \"To win a game at the MCG is a dream come true,\" he said.\n",

AFP Australia were always favourites to bludgeon Bangladesh, but the fact that their Super Eights match was reduced to a mere 22-over-a-side affair made the thrashing appear much more severe. After putting Bangladesh in and keeping them to 104 for 6 - Glenn McGrath picked up 3 for 16 to become the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history - the rampaging Australians barnstormed to the first ten-wicket win of the tournament. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden give bowlers nightmares at the best of times, and when they come out to bat with a license to hit every ball out of sight, and end up doing almost just that, the only emotion you feel is sympathy for those at the receiving end. Gilchrist hit back down the pitch with such exquisite timing that the fielders at mid-on and mid-off had no chance whatsoever.

Matthew Hayden set the game up with an innings of tremendous control and power on a first day cut in half by rain, and the bowlers backed it up with a cool performance on the second. Chasing 323 against Australia's varied attack is a tough ask at the best of times. Fortunately for the West Indians, the dampness caused by the overnight drizzle at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua did nothing to cause exaggerated assistance for the fast bowlers early on.

Australia comfortably defended their 377 for 6, which was set up by Matthew Hayden's fastest World Cup century, and South Africa finished 83 runs adrift. Adam Gilchrist and Hayden put on a century opening stand in less than 15 overs, setting up a launching pad from which the middle-order could wade into the bowling. South Africa's innings started in a similar same way and it was AB de Villiers who ignited the run chase of 378.

After being stranded in the nineties twice this year, Brad Hodge reached his maiden one-day hundred during what was a perfectly paced innings. Defending 359 was always going to be a cake walk and Australia's battery of fast bowlers was too hot for The Netherlands to handle and they were skittled for 129. The pitch was a belter and Ricky Ponting jumped at the chance of more batting practice.

After losing the toss and being asked to bowl first, they stifled England's attacking intent to bowl them out for 135, then raced to an eight-wicket victory with more than a quarter of the overs remaining, thanks largely to an unbeaten 67 from 43 balls from Matthew Hayden. The cause of England's downfall was a muddled performance from their batsman, who seemed more distracted by Australia's pre-match predicament than the Aussies themselves. Though Kevin Pietersen had talked in gleeful terms of \"humiliating\" their oldest rivals and sending them home early, none of his team-mates were able to back up the big words with deeds. Pietersen bristled during a 20-ball cameo but yorked himself when well set on 21, Collingwood clobbered 18 quick runs then missed a low full-toss, and by the time the last five wickets had tumbled for eight runs, Andrew Flintoff's 31 from 19 balls was as good as England could offer.\n",

Pleasingly for Australia, he was also building on the work of their new opener, Phil Jaques, who made 100, while another fresh face, Mitchell Johnson, chipped in with two wickets in each innings. After Michael Vandort induced a slight hiccup from Australia on the fourth day, Lee made sure the plan came back on track on the final morning despite Chamara Silva's 43.\n",

Getty Images India needed a record score to win but instead Australia edged closer to a milestone of their own, posting their 15th consecutive Test victory as they wrapped up the Boxing Day Test within four days. Australia will now head into the Sydney Test that starts on Wednesday aiming to equal their own record of 16 straight Test wins and they will no doubt fancy their chances after India folded for 161 and crashed to a 337-run defeat at the MCG. An extra day's rest will also be much appreciated by Australia's fast bowlers, who toiled hard in searing heat against a stonewalling India. Not only did India forget how to fight, they were outplayed in subcontinent-like conditions as Melbourne's temperature nudged 40 degrees. Ricky Ponting rotated his attack and they showed few signs of exhaustion with Mitchell Johnson picking up 3 for 21 and Brett Lee and Brad Hogg each grabbing two.\n",

Getty Images Ricky Ponting wanted to regain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy more than any of his team-mates and his determination translated into consecutive centuries as he commandeered a dominant 2-0 series win. Ponting was resting when New Zealand whitewashed Australia in February and his mission of revenge was completed after his 134 not out set up a 114-run victory in Hobart. His 107 had done a similar job in securing the opening win in Adelaide, but the home team had some tense moments at Bellerive Oval before Ponting arrived to overcome a deceptive pitch. Australia, who had rested Adam Gilchrist, fell to 3 for 87 after being sent in and needed rescuing by Ponting, who steadied and then accelerated on the way to a rewarding total of 6 for 282. It was far too much for New Zealand, who lost both openers by the fifth over and had half their order gone by 72.\n",

Australia were well on top when the weather turned bad, reducing New Zealand to 3 for 30 after Daniel Vettori chose to bat.

Getty Images Australia's fast bowlers breathed fire after Andrew Symonds flexed his muscle on the way to an eventful 54-run victory over New Zealand. The new-look outfit showed no signs of nerves and the result was sealed as soon as New Zealand slumped to 5 for 31 chasing 186. Shaun Tait, who was back after elbow surgery, raced through two wickets in his first over and Brett Lee's extreme speed was responsible for a couple of breakthroughs in his opening spell.

Getty Images Jacob Oram gave Australia some serious jitters but they successfully defended their huge 5 for 343 that was set up by punishing Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting centuries. Twice in the past 13 months Australia lost games after scoring more than 330, but despite Oram's brilliant unbeaten century, which was interrupted by a half-hour rain delay with eight overs left, they recorded an eight-run success. Oram smashed six sixes in a 71-ball hundred, the fastest by a New Zealander, and he combined with Brendon McCullum in a 137-run stand at more than a run-and-a-half a ball. While they were always behind, the batsmen produced enough fireworks to spark a batch of local nerves.

Hussey's unbeaten 65 was the key in a tight run-chase of 219 and he brought up the win with a six in the 49th over. New Zealand pushed Australia to the very end but their decision to play only four bowlers cost them dearly as Craig McMillan and Nathan Astle proved too easy to score off in the dying overs. McMillan had already done his part with 89 in New Zealand's 219 but Hussey and Michael Clarke (75) earned Australia their fourth win of the series.

Getty Images A committed bowling display led by John Lewis eased England's pain, but it was not enough to prevent another defeat that was set up by a dire batting effort. After England spluttered to 155 all out in 42 overs on a strange surface, the home team copied the mistakes and dropped to 4 for 48 before sweating to a four-wicket victory. Despite gaining an unlikely position of strength through Lewis's three-wicket opening, England again released the pressure and Michael Hussey responded with a match-sealing 46. Hussey worked with Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, who finished on 20 after surviving a torrid spell from Andrew Flintoff, to steer the side out of trouble.

Getty Images New Zealand's batsmen were unable to follow up on Shane Bond's hat-trick and fell 105 runs short of Australia's 289 despite Ross Taylor's fighting 84. The visitors lost their final seven wickets for 23 in a disappointing finish after Bond made a memorable impact to close the first innings. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White launched a late onslaught of 90 in nine overs before Bond ended the partnership in the 50th over when White was caught in the deep and Symonds edged behind next ball attempting a huge drive. Bond, who became the second New Zealander to take a one-day international hat-trick and collected 4 for 61, finished the job with a ripper that took the top of Nathan Bracken's off stump, but his team-mates failed to carry the momentum into their batting.

Andrew Symonds and Cameron White blitzed the hapless attack after the early momentum was created by Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting and they reached 5 for 221. Two wickets in the first two overs of England's chase - including Andrew Flintoff for a duck - ended the contest apart from the interest surrounding Michael Vaughan. England were in the match for about one over and from the moment James Anderson's first six balls went for 14 a huge total was on the cards.

They had a full two days available to do the necessary, but in the end they needed just under two hours, as England's battered and bruised cricketers surrendered by ten wickets in an abject and embarrassing fashion. Fittingly, it was Glenn McGrath who took centre stage in his final appearance at his home ground, the SCG. After Shane Warne's heroics with the bat, McGrath took over with the ball, grabbing 3 for 38 in 21 typically metronomic overs, before Justin Langer - in partnership with his best mate, Matthew Hayden - rattled off the necessary 46 runs in just 11 overs.

Their second-innings 340 at Auckland on Sunday - which was the second-highest chase in ODI history - was bettered again as McMillan showed contempt for the Australia attack despite coming to the crease at 4 for 41.

In that time Australia blew away Sri Lanka's top order, and though they made a recovery of sorts to reach 101, it was a dismal performance and Australia strolled to a ten-wicket win with almost half their overs intact.\n",

      "Australia 124 for 1 (Hayden 73*, Gilchrist 43) beat Bangladesh 123 for 8 (Lee 3-27) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out True to form: Mathew Hayden bullied Bangladesh with a belligerent 73 not out ? Getty Images It was swift and clinical. Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals as Australia's fast bowlers hit a persistent short-of-length to set the game up and restrict Bangladesh to 123, before Mathew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist easily powered Australia to a nine-wicket win. Bangladesh had detonated the West Indies and South African new-ball attacks but that was because they were offered a fuller length that allowed them to blast through the line. Australia recognised it and didn't offer much on the fuller side today. The idea was to put the ball in the right place, as Lee emphasised at the end of the match.\n",

      "Australia 136 for 2 (Hayden 67*) beat England 135 (Flintoff 31, Bracken 3-16) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Matt Hayden: unstoppable at the top of Australia's innings ? Getty Images Australia bounced back in style from Wednesday night's humiliation against Zimbabwe, producing a performance with bat and ball that was as disciplined and purposeful as their earlier efforts had been flaccid and complacent. After losing the toss and being asked to bowl first, they stifled England's attacking intent to bowl them out for 135, then raced to an eight-wicket victory with more than a quarter of the overs remaining, thanks largely to an unbeaten 67 from 43 balls from Matthew Hayden. The cause of England's downfall was a muddled performance from their batsman, who seemed more distracted by Australia's pre-match predicament than the Aussies themselves. Though Kevin Pietersen had talked in gleeful terms of \"humiliating\" their oldest rivals and sending them home early, none of his team-mates were able to back up the big words with deeds. Pietersen bristled during a 20-ball cameo but yorked himself when well set on 21, Collingwood clobbered 18 quick runs then missed a low full-toss, and by the time the last five wickets had tumbled for eight runs, Andrew Flintoff's 31 from 19 balls was as good as England could offer.\n"
