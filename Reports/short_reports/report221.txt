Australia 383 and 3 for 127 (Warner 47) beat South Africa 9 for 259 dec and 250 (Cook 104, Starc 4-80, Lyon 3-60) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details In the end there was no whitewash - Australia were not swept in a home series for the first time since 1887. Instead, the dead-rubber bounce that Test cricket so often produces again manifested itself as Australia chased down 127 to win the third Test against South Africa at Adelaide Oval. Australia's sequence of five consecutive Test losses ended, and it ended with two debutant batsmen at the crease. South Africa, of course, won the series. They finished with a 2-1 result that will still go down as an outstanding achievement given the developing nature of their own side.
