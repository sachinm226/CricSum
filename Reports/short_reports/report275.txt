Australia 4 for 270 (Finch 121, Warner 65) beat England 7 for 269 (Ballance 79, Morgan 50, McKay 3-44) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:10 Ehantharajah: England's top order fails to convince Aaron Finch is becoming Australia's post-Ashes specialist. Four days after the end of the Ashes in England, the teams reconvened in Southampton for the first of the short-form matches and Finch broke the all-time record for the highest Twenty20 international score with 156. This time, one week after Australia completed their 5-0 Ashes clean sweep, Finch became the first Victorian to score an ODI hundred at the MCG as Australia cruised to a six-wicket win with 26 balls to spare. If England hoped that a change of fortunes would accompany their change of format and clothing, they were mistaken. Things looked okay for a while.
