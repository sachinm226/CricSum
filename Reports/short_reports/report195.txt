Australia 205 for 5 (Warner 77, Maxwell 75) beat South Africa 204 for 7 (du Plessis 79, Faulkner 3-28) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A dramatic final over filled with fumbles in the field saw James Faulkner and Mitchell Marsh take Australia to a first T20 win in six matches and level the series at 1-1 with their highest successful chase. Australia had slipped to 32 for 3 in pursuit of 205 before David Warner and Glenn Maxwell posted a record fourth-wicket partnership of 161 but were both dismissed to set up a thrilling, last-ball finish. Chris Morris had Maxwell caught on the cover boundary with the fifth ball of the penultimate over to leave Kagiso Rabada 11 to defend. Rabada started with a full straight delivery which Warner missed as he cleared the front leg to swing across the line, bowling him off his pad to put South Africa in the pound seat. Then a message came from the dugout, which seemed to instruct Rabada to bowl outside off stump but he went too wide.
