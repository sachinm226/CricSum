Australia 5 for 534 dec (Burns 180, Head 161, Patterson 114*) and 3 for 196 dec (Khawaja 101*, Head 59*) beat Sri Lanka 215 (Karunaratne 59, Starc 5-54) and 149 (Starc 5-46) by 366 runs A rampant Mitchell Starc devastated the Sri Lanka top order, sending the visitors hurtling to a fourth-day 366-run defeat at Canberra. Sri Lanka failed to reach a total of 200 for the third time in four innings in Australia; and none of their batsmen were able to cross fifty. They have now been winless since late October, and have lost six of the last seven Tests they have played. For Starc, this Test has been an emphatic return to form, after a tough home summer. He sealed the victory with his tenth wicket in the match - the second time he has achieved a 10-for, the other occasion also having been against Sri Lanka.
