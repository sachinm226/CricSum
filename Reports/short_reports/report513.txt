Pakistan 162 for 9 (Kamran Akmal 33, O'Keefe 3-29, Nannes 3-30) beat Australia 151 (D Hussey 33, Mohammad Aamer 3-27) by 11 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kamran Akmal gave Pakistan a good start, and they kicked on from there PA Photos If Pakistan are a confidence team, their Twenty20 efforts over the past two days augur well for next week's first Test. A day after they ended their 12-match losing stretch against Australia across all formats, Mohammad Aamer helped them begin their own winning streak with an 11-run victory that brought 2-0 series triumph. Tests are a very different story, but their Twenty20 form has given the group a spark. There was a distinct sense of d?j? vu after Monday's game; again there was a big crowd of Pakistan fans, again Pakistan scored around the 160 mark and again Australia's batsmen were tied down and couldn't lift their tempo for a successful chase. The last pair was left needing 19 from the final over and despite a six from Dirk Nannes, they came up short.
