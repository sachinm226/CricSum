Australia 193 for 5 (Warner 57, Finch 55) beat South Africa 96 (Agar 3-16, Starc 3-23) by 97 runs South Africa failed to win a fourth successive home series and will go a full calendar year without a trophy since they beat Sri Lanka at home last March following defeat to Australia in the series finale in Cape Town. After choosing to field first, South Africa's five-man attack leaked runs in the first half of Australia's innings but it was their batting line-up that really let them down. Their chase was up before it had even properly begun when they reduced to 23 for 2 in the third over and 65 for 5 at the halfway stage. Australia needed just 5.3 more overs to wrap up their victory and condemn South Africa to their second-worst defeat in this format, five days after subjecting them to their worst.
