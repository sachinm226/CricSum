Australia 362 for 3 (Marsh 151, Finch 148) beat Scotland 162 (Machan 39, Johnson 4-36) by 200 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Aaron Finch peppered the boundary with seven sixes and 16 fours Getty Images Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh shared an opening stand of 246 - the second-highest Australia partnership for any wicket in ODIs - in a clinical dissection of Scotland, who were beaten by 200 runs. The pair erased Geoff Marsh and David Boon's Australia record of 212 for an opening partnership, made against India and a record that had stood proudly since 1986. That wasn't the only record to fall. Australia's 362 for 3 surpassed the 345 they scored against the same team, made here four years ago, and the 334 for 6 they made against Scotland at the 2007 World Cup. In the field, the hosts were athletic and efficient, but their bowling was blunt.
