New Zealand 241 for 9 (Styris 55) beat Australia 190 (Watson 53, Bond 4-26, Southee 4-36) by 51 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Scott Styris was the highest scorer for the match with 55 Getty Images Tim Southee and Shane Bond ensured New Zealand's series finished on a high but with the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy already conceded, it was only a consolation victory for the hosts over Australia. The 51-run triumph might at least give New Zealand some spark heading in to the Test series, which begins up the road at the Basin Reserve on Friday, and it left the ODI scoreline at 3-2. Ricky Ponting didn't lose a toss for the whole series and again made New Zealand set a target, but this time on a two-paced pitch their 241 for 9 appeared competitive. A double-wicket maiden from Bond early on put Australia on the back foot before Southee ran through the middle-order with 4 for 36 to confirm the win as Australia were dismissed for 190 with 3.5 overs to spare.
