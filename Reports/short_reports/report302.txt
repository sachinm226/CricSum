Australia 8 for 275 (Watson 82, Finch 76, Smith 67, Peterson 4-32) beat South Africa 6 for 280 (De Kock 107, Behardien 63, Rossouw 51, Cummins 3-54) by 2 wickets (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Quinton de Kock's sixth ODI ton featured 14 fours Getty Images Australia will enter the World Cup year ranked as the game's top ODI team and with the likes of Steve Smith, Aaron Finch and Shane Watson all running into ominous form, following a fourth victory in five matches over a sloppy South Africa at the SCG. The hosts had more to play for in this fixture than the visitors, and it showed during their chase of 275, reduced from 281 by the second of two brief showers for the day. Finch, Watson and Smith all struck the ball cleanly, though the latter's sublime run of scores was maintained partly by some ordinary work in the field by a South African side missing AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn. Morne Morkel's confidence ebbed away, as epitomised by a dreadful misfield to concede a boundary to Smith, who was also bowled off a Kyle Abbott no-ball and edged Morkel behind though the South Africans did not deign to appeal. Finch and Watson gave less chances, both working their way into decent touch after slow starts to the summer.
