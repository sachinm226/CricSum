Australia 8 for 324 (Smith 164, Head 52) beat New Zealand 256 (Guptill 114, Hazlewood 3-49) by 68 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For the first time this summer, Steven Smith could do no wrong. In the Tests against South Africa, he didn't win a single toss, didn't manage a hundred, didn't lead his side to a victory until the series was dead. But a change of format and opposition brought a change of fortunes. Smith won the toss, plundered for himself the highest ODI score ever made at the SCG, then took a truly remarkable catch as Australia secured a 1-0 lead in the Chappell-Hadlee series. There were other highlights in a match that finished as a 68-run victory for Australia.
