Pakistan 187 for 4 (Fakhar 91, Shoaib Malik 43*) beat Australia 183 for 8 (Short 76, Finch 47, Amir 3-33) by six wickets It's been a curious week to schedule a T20I tri-series. What with the Wimbledon Championships kicking off and the World Cup approaching its enthralling climax, this T20 tri-series in Harare (which, as far as we can tell, doesn't really have a name) was never destined to be the highlight of July's sporting calendar. Having said that, it would have been hard to pick a week all calendar year where this particular series would take centrestage. But the series did provide something some of the world's biggest competitions fail to do. It provided a final to grace the occasion.
