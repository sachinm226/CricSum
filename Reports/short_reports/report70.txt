Australia 297 for 9 (Smith 116, Warner 43, Plunkett 4-69) beat England 285 all out (Vince 64, Buttler 52, Behrendorff 2-43) by 12 runs Something about England seems to inspire Steven Smith into producing his absolute best. The warm-up at Southampton, where he was greeted with hostility from a sizable crowd, was no different. He brought up his fourth fifty-plus score since returning from his year-long ban, converting this one into a hundred, which formed the backbone of Australia's 297 for nine. England may have fancied chasing it down, but on a two-paced surface, it proved just out of reach despite stand-in captain Jos Buttler's brilliance. England were down to only 11 fit players at the start, instead of the permitted 15.
