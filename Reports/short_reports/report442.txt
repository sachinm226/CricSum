Australia 361 for 8 (Hussey 108, Watson 72, Razzak 3-58, Mortaza 3-80) beat Bangladesh 295 for 6 (Kayes 93, Mahmudullah 68*, Nafees 60, Johnson 3-67) by 66 runs Scorecard and ball by-ball details Michael Hussey made 108, his first ODI century in four years Associated Press Michael Clarke will fly out of Bangladesh with a clean-sweep to his name in his first series as Australia's full-time captain, but it didn't come without a few jitters in the final match. Michael Hussey's century and another Shane Watson blitz set Australia on the path to their fourth-highest ODI total of all time, and while the final margin of 66 runs may appear comfortable, Bangladesh put up a feisty chase. The hosts needed 362 for victory, which even their most ardent fans must have felt was unachievable after they managed only 210 and 229 in the first two matches. But Imrul Kayes and his top-order colleagues gave the Mirpur crowd something to cheer about, pushing the score to 179 for 1 with 20 overs remaining, and Clarke was scratching his head for an answer. It came in the form of the debutant fast bowler James Pattinson, who picked up his first wicket for his country - not the same country his brother Darren represented - when Kayes edged behind for 93, and the required run-rate crept into unrealistic territory.
