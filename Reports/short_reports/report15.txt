Australia 156 for 6 (Finch 79*, Sodhi 3-32) beat New Zealand106 (Jamieson 30, K Richardson 3-19) by 50 runs A crucial innings from captain Aaron Finch on a tricky pitch, as he became Australia's leading scorer in men's T20Is, followed by a tight display in the field enabled them to take the series to a decider in Wellington on Sunday as the home side's batting disappointed for the second game running. On a surface being used for the fourth time in three days (with two more matches to come), scoring was much tougher than when Australia put more than 200 on the board in the previous game. New Zealand had control for the majority of the time in the field - Ish Sodhi and Trent Boult taking five wickets between them - but Finch took full toll in the final over of the innings as Kyle Jamieson was plundered for 26. New Zealand were under pressure from the start of the chase and could not make a dent on the target in the powerplay. Australia's three spinners - Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa and Glenn Maxwell - produced combined figures of 11-0-49-6.
