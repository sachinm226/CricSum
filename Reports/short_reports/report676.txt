Australia 5 for 291 (Ponting 104, Hodge 99*) beat New Zealand 7 for 290 (Vincent 90, Fulton 60) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ricky Ponting rescued Australia with 104 before Brad Hodge applied the finishing touches ? Getty Images Ricky Ponting quickly returned Australia's winning habit with a calm century and Brad Hodge sealed his short-term future with an unbeaten 99 as they beat New Zealand by five wickets. Chasing a ground-record target of 291, Australia started slowly before warming up through a two-paced partnership of 154 between Hodge and Ponting that forced New Zealand to fight with England on Tuesday for a spot in the finals. After missing the 92-run loss on Friday - the first of Australia's summer - Ponting was determined to prevent another defeat and he produced a superb performance against a testing attack. Hodge, who replaced the injured Andrew Symonds, had scores of 0 and 1 in his two previous appearances and arrived to a "pressure cooker" atmosphere, but he walked off his home ground having hit the final runs. "To win a game at the MCG is a dream come true," he said.
