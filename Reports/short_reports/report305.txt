South Africa 7 for 157 (de Villiers 48, Hazlewood 5-31) beat Australia 154 (Marsh 67, Morkel 5-21, Steyn 3-35) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Morne Morkel took a career-best 5 for 21 Getty Images Morne Morkel wreaked havoc and together with AB de Villiers, wrecked Australia's chances of taking a 2-0 series lead in the second ODI at the WACA. Morkel's career-best 5 for 21 helped to skittle Australia for 154, a total that was barely half of what they made in the first game on Friday and showed how fortunate they were that South Africa dropped so many chances on that occasion. A brisk 48 from 41 scored by de Villiers confirmed the result. The chase was not entirely straightforward for South Africa, who were 2 for 21 after losing both openers early, and wobbled towards the end as Josh Hazlewood completed his first five-wicket haul in ODI cricket. But Hazlewood's efforts were offset by a leaky display from Nathan Coulter-Nile, whose six overs cost 54, and South Africa reached their target with three wickets in hand and 22.
