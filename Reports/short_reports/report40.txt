Australia 146 for 5 (Marsh 39*, Finch 39, Rashid 3-21) beat England 145 for 6 (Bairstow 55, Denly 29*, Zampa 2-34) by five wickets A cool-headed knock by Mitchell Marsh handed Australia a consolation win worth more than just that to the tourists in the third and final T20I against England at the Ageas Bowl. A superb spell from Adil Rashid yielded three wickets and gave Australia a big scare, especially given their failure to chase down a modest target in the opening match of the series. But Marsh, playing his first T20I since February, carried them over the line by five wickets with just three balls to spare with his unbeaten 39 off 36 balls.

With England already having sealed the series, Tuesday's result made it 2-1 but also wrested back the World No.
