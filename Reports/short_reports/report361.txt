Australia 204 (Haddin 65, Rogers 61, Anderson 4-67) and 2 for 231 (Rogers 116, Watson 83*) beat England 255 (Pietersen 71, Johnson 5-63) and 179 (Cook 51, Lyon 5-50, Johnson 3-25) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:17 Jarrod Kimber's Ashes report: England's matrix is destroyed This time last year, the thought of Australia's cricketers reaching Sydney with a 4-0 Ashes margin in their pockets seemed about as likely as that of the long discarded Chris Rogers making a century in the Boxing Day Test. So there was rare joy experienced by Australia, Rogers and another bounteous MCG crowd as both events came to pass, with the considerable assistance of a staggeringly listless England. A successful chase offered vindication to Michael Clarke, who sent England in to bat in the knowledge that the drop-in pitch would improve across the match. A first Test century in Australia provided rich satisfaction for Rogers, plus the assurance that he will be on the plane for next year's South Africa tour. But another day of humiliation left England in a state of total despair, having coughed up their fourth defeat from a day three position that had looked close to impregnable.
