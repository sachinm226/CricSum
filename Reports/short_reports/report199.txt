Australia 8 for 0 v South Africa match abandoned Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A washout in Bridgetown on Sunday meant Australia face a do-or-die clash against West Indies in their final league game Getty Images AB de Villiers' 200th ODI for South Africa went much the same way his 100th Test did, as Sunday's tri-series fixture was the first to be washed out, with only an over possible. Just as November's Bangalore Test involved long periods of watching and waiting, the first game of the series in Barbados dragged on for over five hours because of intermittent rain, which denied South Africa an opportunity to qualify for the final. Instead they shared points with Australia, who now face a must-win clash against hosts West Indies in their final league fixture at the same venue on Tuesday. The damp squib ended the possibility of what could have been the first battle of the quicks in this tournament. Both sides bolstered their seam stocks in anticipation of a surface with more pace and bounce.
