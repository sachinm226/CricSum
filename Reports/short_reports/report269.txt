Australia 2 for 131 (Bailey 60*, White 58*) beat England 9 for 130 (Buttler 22, Hazlewood 4-30) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details An unbeaten 58 from Cameron White helped Australia cruise to victory Getty Images As Twenty20 wins go, this was comprehensive. So comprehensive that Brad Hodge did not even get to bat in his first international for nearly six years. The Melbourne fans were disappointed at that, but pleased their other Victorian favourite, Cameron White, played a key part in Australia's pulverisation of England. White and George Bailey feasted on England's lacklustre bowling, cruising to the target of 131 in the 15th over with eight wickets in hand. It meant a third series defeat for England on this tour.
