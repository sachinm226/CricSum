Australia 124 for 1 (Hayden 73*, Gilchrist 43) beat Bangladesh 123 for 8 (Lee 3-27) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out True to form: Mathew Hayden bullied Bangladesh with a belligerent 73 not out ? Getty Images It was swift and clinical. Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals as Australia's fast bowlers hit a persistent short-of-length to set the game up and restrict Bangladesh to 123, before Mathew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist easily powered Australia to a nine-wicket win. Bangladesh had detonated the West Indies and South African new-ball attacks but that was because they were offered a fuller length that allowed them to blast through the line. Australia recognised it and didn't offer much on the fuller side today. The idea was to put the ball in the right place, as Lee emphasised at the end of the match.
