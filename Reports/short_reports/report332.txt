Match abandoned Australia 243 for 8 (Voges 71, Bailey 55, McClenaghan 4-65) v New Zealand 51 for 2 Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Rain had the final say in Edgbaston AFP The famously fickle English weather hadn't hurt the Champions Trophy much over its first six days, but struck in the crucial trans-Tasman match to leave Australia and New Zealand with split points. New Zealand were 51 for 2 after 15 overs in their chase of 244 when play was interrupted, and couldn't resume. It is hard to tell whether either team will be happy with the split points. New Zealand were in a marginally worse position in the match, and the point from here means even a washout in their final league game could be enough to take them to the elimination rounds. Australia, having lost their first game, will probably be more aggrieved.
