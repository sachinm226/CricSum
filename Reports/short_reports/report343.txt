Australians 227 for 6 (Watson 45, Stokes 2-27) drew with England Lions 269 for 7 dec (Ballance 104) Scorecard Phillip Hughes was given a working over by the Lions quicks but battled to make 30 Getty Images On the eve of this match, Australia's coach Darren Lehmann was asked whether any restrictions would be placed on how long a batsman could play, given the two-day contest was limited to 100 overs per side. "I don't think we're at that stage where we can do that," Lehmann said. "If someone can bat 100 overs, they bat 100 overs." It turns out even surviving for 100 balls was too tall an order for any of the Australians. Matthew Wade and James Faulkner might have got there, well established as they were when bad light ended play just after 5pm, consigning the one-innings match to a draw with Australia on 227 for 6 in their chase of 270.
