South Africa 7 for 272 (Duminy 71, McKenzie 63, A Morkel 40*) beat Australia 8 for 271 (Marsh 79, D Hussey 52) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Shaun Marsh posted his third half-century from his past four ODI innings ? AFP JP Duminy and Neil McKenzie set up South Africa's sixth win from six ODIs against Australia at the MCG before Albie Morkel finished the job with a magnificent unbeaten 40 from 18 balls. The loss of McKenzie and Duminy left South Africa in big trouble as they needed 50 from six overs with three wickets in hand, but Morkel and Johan Botha used the batting powerplay to perfection to get them home with three balls to spare. The powerplay was taken at the start of the 45th over and Morkel used it to destroy Australia, particularly Ben Hilfenhaus, with four fours and a six. They picked up 51 from the powerplay and it was a frenetic end to a chase that had meandered through the middle overs, when Duminy showed more self-control than some Trappist monks, as he compiled 71 without a boundary. He nudged and guided while Ricky Ponting relied on the medium and slow offerings of James Hopes, David Hussey and Michael Clarke through the middle overs, yet somehow he maintained a healthy strike-rate of 76.
