England Lions 352 (Moore 120, Rashid 66, Denly 66, Lee 6-76) and 162 for 4 (Morgan 28*, Johnson 2-48) drew with Australians 358 and 438 for 4 dec (North 191*, Clarke 80, Hussey 62) Scorecard How they were out Marcus North finished the match unbeaten on 191 Getty Images Marcus North led the Australians with 191 not out and they were also encouraged by the performances of Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee as they completed a useful warm-up for Wednesday's first Test. After North sped the Australians to 438 for 4 at the lunch-time declaration in Worcester, the tourists were pleased to see Johnson remove both openers and Lee gain reverse-swing in the 33rd over before the match was called off almost an hour early. The end was signalled shortly after the umpire Jeff Evans collapsed on the side of the pitch with the England Lions 162 for 4. Johnson was more fluent as he built on a rusty performance in the first innings during a nine-over spell that set him up for Cardiff. He enters the Ashes as Australia's major weapon and the only thing missing is the sharp movement that turned him into a dominator during the series in South Africa.
