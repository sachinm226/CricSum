Australia 241 for 5 (Khawaja 89, Vandersay 2-51) beat Sri Lanka 239 for 8 (Thirimanne 56, Zampa 2-39) by five wickets David Warner was rested due to leg soreness and Steven Smith did all his batting in the nets, as Australia's other big names Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc revved into rhythm and form in a comprehensive defeat of Sri Lanka in the World Cup warm-up match at the Hampshire Bowl. Usman Khawaja compiled an attractive 89 to press his case for the No. 3 batting spot, given intense competition for places that see him effectively duelling with Shaun Marsh for one spot, guiding Australia most of the way to victory with 31 balls to spare. Using their pace and bounce to good effect, Cummins and Starc conceded a mere 19 runs from the final four overs of Sri Lanka's innings to restrict Dimuth Karunaratne's team to a mere 239 for 8, after they struggled to build momentum against Australia's varied bowling attack on a slow and wearing pitch - the same one used for Australia's earlier win over England on Saturday. Combined figures of 2 for 61 from 17 overs left Starc (still recovering from a throat ailment) and Cummins in decent fettle ahead of their tournament opener against Afghanistan, their speed nicely complemented by the spin of Adam Zampa, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell and Smith.
