Sri Lanka 174 (Mathews 58, Harris 3-38) and 317 for 6 (Sangakkara 69, Paranavitana 55, M Jayawardene 51, Harris 3-54) drew with Australia 411 (Hussey 142, Marsh 141, Randiv 3-103) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kumar Sangakkara was caught at slip in the fourth over of the day AFP Australia did many things right in the second Test but in the end they couldn't beat the Pallekele weather, or Sri Lanka, as the match faded away to a gloomy draw on the fifth afternoon. The teams will now head to Colombo for the final match with the series still undecided, a heartening outcome for Sri Lanka, who were outplayed for most of the first two Tests but fought hard on the final two days in Pallekele. Only 35.3 overs were bowled on the final day, not nearly enough for Michael Clarke and his men, who needed a run of wickets to set up a small chase. Ryan Harris worked tirelessly to finish with three wickets - and a hamstring niggle - but when the weather and gloomy conditions set in during the early afternoon, Sri Lanka led by 80 runs with four wickets in hand, having done enough to save themselves.
