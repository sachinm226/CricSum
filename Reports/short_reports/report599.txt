Australia 535 (Haddin 169, Clarke 110, Ponting 79, Hussey 70) beat New Zealand 270 (Redmond 83, Lee 4-66) and 203 (McCullum 84*, Lee 5-105) by an innings and 62 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Brett Lee was too hot for New Zealand to handle as they slumped to a heavy defeat ? AFP Brett Lee's five-wicket haul was responsible for another disastrous performance from New Zealand's ailing batting order as Australia stormed to an innings-and-62-run victory and a 2-0 series success. Run making has been a severe problem for the tourists throughout the contest, but they left their most inept performance till last on a friendly pitch, falling to 6 for 84 on the way to 203. Lee, who took nine wickets for a career-best match return, was not at his best during the India tour, but he has improved with each innings since coming home and re-affirmed his status as the attack leader by finding life in the dead surface. All the serious damage came in the first session when Lee blasted four wickets in a 10-over spell that cost 23 runs. The visitors started the fourth day 230 behind and were soon caught in a Lee whirlwind that resulted in a demoralising defeat in the final Test for the coach John Bracewell.
