England 304 for 7 (Morgan 92, Cummins 4-49) beat Australia 299 for 7 (Maxwell 85, Bailey 75, Wade 50*, Willey 3-51) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Eoin Morgan led England to a three-wicket victory in the fourth ODI at Headingley, where they levelled the series 2-2 and ensured the final match at Old Trafford on Sunday will be the decider. It was, in the end, a near perfectly judged run chase. England needed 300, exactly a run a ball in 50 overs, and Morgan showed his team-mates how to pace the pursuit, with 92 off 92 balls himself. They got there with ten balls to spare, but not without some high drama along the way, including a pair of spectacular catches from Glenn Maxwell that threatened to bring Australia back into the contest. But England's nerve held, and fittingly David Willey clubbed the winning six down the ground off John Hastings to complete a fine day that began with him claiming three wickets in the first ten overs of the morning.
