South Africa 6 for 108 (du Plessis 27, de Kock 22, Tye 2-18) beat Australia 7 for 87 (Maxwell 38, Morris 2-12) by 21 runs A torrential downpour on the Gold Coast dampened the mood before South Africa inflicted Australia's third loss in four matches to leave the home side down right miserable. Australia have now lost their last four T20Is and five of the last six on top of losing a one-day and Test series in between times. The rain reduced the game to a 10 overs-a-side on a surface at Metricon Stadium that was hosting international cricket for the first time. South Africa coped with the unknowns of the conditions and the pitch better than their opponents, piling on 108 in 10 overs thanks to a power-packed Powerplay from Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks. Australia's chase drowned under the scoreboard pressure.
