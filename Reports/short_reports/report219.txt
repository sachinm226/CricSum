South Africa 372 for 6 (Miller 118*, de Kock 70) beat Australia 371 for 6 (Warner 117, Smith 108, Finch 53) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:59 By the Numbers: South Africa's second-highest successful chase David Miller's third ODI hundred helped South Africa pull off the second-highest chase of all time and seal the series against Australia with two matches to spare. Miller has chosen not to play his domestic cricket at the Durban-based Dolphins this summer but thrilled his former home crowd during the highest successful chase at Kingsmead with a heroic knock that will become the stuff of legend. In the 31st over, with Miller on 26 and South Africa needing to score at more than eight runs an over, he tweaked a groin muscle running between the wickets. At the start of the next over, South Africa lost their fifth wicket and their last specialist batsmen when JP Duminy holed out. They were 217 for 5 and victory was 155 runs away.
