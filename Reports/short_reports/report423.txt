Australia 5 for 450 dec and 278 beat Sri Lanka 336 and 255 (Sangakkara 63, Samaraweera 49, Starc 5-63, Siddle 4-50) by 137 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Peter Siddle had Kumar Sangakkara out lbw Getty Images At last, Michael Clarke must have thought. At last Australia have tasted victory this summer. It took until the fourth Test of their home campaign, and into the final hour at that, but Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle delivered a 137-run win for Clarke and their team-mates as Sri Lanka's tail-enders narrowly failed to hold on for a draw at Bellerive Oval. Despite the best efforts of Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera in particular, Sri Lanka will walk out on Boxing Day at the MCG 1-0 down. As the gloom began to close in, Australia entered the final hour needing two more wickets; Sri Lanka's victory target of 393 had become irrelevant during the morning.
