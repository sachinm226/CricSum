South Africa 311 (Elgar 141*, de Villiers 64, Cummins 4-78) and 373 (Markram 84, De Kock 65, De Villiers 63, Philander 52*, Cummins 3-67, Hazlewood 3-69, Lyon 3-102) beat Australia 255 (Bancroft 77, Morkel 4-87, Rabada 4-91) and 107 (Morkel 5-23) by 322 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details South Africa might have won the Test, but the real winner was schadenfreude. After the ball-tampering events of Saturday, nobody outside of the Australian team - and possibly not even they - could have wished for any result other than a huge South African victory. And so it came to pass, a 322-run win that even for the South Africans must have felt strange. Australia were the losers in every way: they lost not only the Test, but their captain to suspension, and their credibility. Normally after an outcome like this, the focus would be on yet another Australian batting collapse, all out for 107 in a chase of 430.
