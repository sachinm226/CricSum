Australia 352 (Hughes 115, Katich 108) and 331 for 5 dec (Hughes 160, Ponting 81) beat South Africa 138 (Duminy 73*, Johnson 3-37, McDonald 3-25) and 370 (Kallis 93, de Villiers 84, Siddle 3-61, Katich 3-45) by 175 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out AB de Villiers made a fine 84 before Peter Siddle ended his resistance AFP The transitional period is over. An emphatic series win in South Africa will imbue Australia with confidence that, after a harrowing six-month search, they have uncovered a crop of cricketers capable of competing with the world's best. The Australians sealed a comprehensive 175-run victory at Kingsmead shortly before tea on the fifth day, prompting scenes of jubilation from a team barely recognisable to that which last tasted series success on South African shores. In claiming an unassailable 2-0 series lead, Ricky Ponting's band of rookies defended the No. 1 Test ranking earned by their venerable forebears and created a difficult situation for Andrew Hilditch's selection panel when the likes of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Andrew Symonds return in the coming months.
