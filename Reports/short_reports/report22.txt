Australia 191 (Paine 73, Ashwin 4-55) and 93 for 2 (Burns 51*) beat India 244 (Kohli 74, Starc 4-53) and 36 (Hazlewood 5-8, Cummins 4-21) by eight wickets A fascinatingly poised Test match. What sort of target could Australia chase? The scene set for Virat Kohli to sign off the tour with a defining innings? The third day in Adelaide promised so much - in many ways it delivered, but in scarcely believable fashion as Josh Hazlewood - who reached 200 Test wickets - and Pat Cummins dismantled India for their lowest-ever Test total with Australia securing victory before the floodlights were even needed. India resumed at 9 for 1, having lost Prithvi Shaw late the previous evening, with a lead of 62 under their belts and the expectation that anything over 200 would make them favourites to repeat their 2018-19 victory on this ground. In the space of 16 overs they were all out, without a single batsman reaching double figures - a first in Test history. To compound their woes, last-man Mohammed Shami was forced to retire hurt to close the innings after a fierce blow on the arm from Cummins.
