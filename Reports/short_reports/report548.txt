Ricky Ponting called Australia's performance in the heavy loss to South Africa the worst in a long time, but has vowed to improve for the third game in Cape Town on Thursday. The tourists were dismissed for 131 in 40.2 overs after starting the match by dropping to 5 for 19. South Africa passed the target for the loss of three wickets and levelled the five-fixture contest that will determine the game's No. 1 side.
