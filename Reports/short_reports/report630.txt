Australia 290 for 7 (Clarke 82, Watson 81) beat Zimbabwe 184 for 7 (Williams 44) by 106 runs Scorecard Michael Clarke sweeps during his 82 ? Getty Images Shane Watson and Michael Clarke helped Australia end their losing streak but their bowlers were less convincing in a 106-run warm-up victory over Zimbabwe at St Vincent. Clarke made 82 and Watson scored 81 as Australia posted 290 for 7 but the attack could not dismiss Zimbabwe, who pushed and prodded their way to 184 for 7. Sean Williams and Stuart Matsikenyeri added 67 for the fourth wicket to frustrate Australia but the target was always too much for Zimbabwe. Australia used eight bowlers and their 14 overs of spin gave Zimbabwe their best chance to score. Brad Hogg continued his luckless run with 0 for 36 from eight overs but it was the part-time offspin of Brad Hodge that removed Williams caught-and-bowled for 44.
