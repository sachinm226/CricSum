Australia 369 (Warner 180, Yadav 5-93) beat India 161 (Kohli 44, Hilfenhaus 4-43) and 171 (Kohli 75, Hilfenhaus 4-54) by an innings and 37 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ben Hilfenhaus claimed four wickets in each innings Getty Images Australia's fast bowlers completed an innings-and-37-run destruction of India minutes after lunch on day three of the third Test, snatching the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in the most emphatic style imaginable. Ryan Harris split a stubborn stand between Virat Kohli and Rahul Dravid before Peter Siddle nicked out MS Dhoni in the shadows of the interval, and Ben Hilfenhaus razed the tail with three wickets in five balls on resumption. Siddle found Kohli's outside edge to complete proceedings, heralding the start of rich celebrations for the hosts following victory over opponents who never came to terms with the challenges posed by Australia's bowlers and conditions. The performance of the match was by a home batsman however, and it was a measure of the Man-of-the-Match David Warner's 180 that India's batsmen fell short of his individual tally in each innings. His efforts gave the pace ensemble a chance to squeeze India, and all the bowlers contributed in another strikingly even performance.
