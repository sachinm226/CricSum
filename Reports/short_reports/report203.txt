Australia 117 for 4 in 25.4 overs (Warner 55*, Narine 2-36) beat West Indies 116 in 32.3 overs (Zampa 3-16, Lyon 3-39) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details "Spin to win" became Australia's new catchphrase as Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa left West Indies nursing a six-wicket loss. Mitchell Starc, on his return from foot surgery, added considerable venom to the cause even if his control was still some way short of his 2015 best. Much had been made of Starc's recall, but it was the spin of Lyon, Zampa and Glenn Maxwell that mired the hosts on another sluggish pitch at Providence Stadium in Guyana.
