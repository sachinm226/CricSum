Australia 9 for 182 (Warner 89, Steyn 3-38) beat South Africa 130 (Duminy 78, D Hussey 3-25) by 52 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out David Warner launched six sixes, including a couple of monsters over midwicket ? PA Photos David Warner made one of the most memorable international debuts imaginable as he lit up the MCG with 89 from 43 balls to set up Australia's 52-run win over South Africa. Not even a superb 78 from JP Duminy could rescue South Africa's chase and he watched his partners fall around him as they fizzled out for 130 in the 18th over. The crowd appreciated Duminy's brilliance, particularly when he scooped a Shaun Tait half-volley over the wicketkeeper's head for six, but it was Warner who was undeniably the star of the show. It was an incredible situation for a man previously so unknown that the scoreboard operators didn't have a photo of him when the teams were displayed. Warner, 22, had already created history by simply playing the match; he was the first man to debut for Australia in any format without first-class experience since 1877.
