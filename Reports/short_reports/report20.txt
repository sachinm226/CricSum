Australia 338 (Smith 131, Labuschagne 91, Pucovski 62) and 312 for 6 dec (Green 84, Smith 81, Labuschagne 73) drew with India 244 (Gill 50, Pujara 50, Cummins 4-29) and 334 for 5 (Pant 97, Pujara 77, Sharma 52) A bruised and battered India line-up couldn't run between the wickets for more than a session. They had a player with a fractured thumb waiting to bat next. They were without their original captain and best batsman. They copped one blow after another off short-pitched bowling, against one of the best bowling attacks. And yet, against all odds, India produced one of the most dramatic displays of patient batting and exemplary fighting spirit to pull off a draw that hardly anyone saw coming when the fifth day started.
