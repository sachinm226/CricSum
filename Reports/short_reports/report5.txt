Bangladesh 131 for 7 (Shakib 36, Naim 30, Hazlewood 3-24, Starc 2-33) beat Australia 108 (Marsh 45, Nasum 4-19, Mustafizur 2-16, Shoriful 2-19) by 23 runs Bangladesh recorded their first T20I victory against Australia in five attempts by defending 131 with the help of their frontline spinners who picked six wickets in 12 overs for just 65 runs. Australia had the upper hand at the halfway mark but the dismissal of Alex Carey first ball, followed by two more batters by the third over, meant that they had their backs to the wall early on. After that, though Mitchell Marsh tried to keep Australia in the contest with a patient run-a-ball 45 from No. 3, wickets at regular intervals left them 23 short in the end. Bangladesh used spin right from the first ball.
