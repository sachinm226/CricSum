Australia 130 for 6 (Maxwell 66, Warner 25, Dilshan 2-8, Pathirana 2-23) beat Sri Lanka 128 for 9 (Dhananjaya 62, Zampa 3-16, Faulkner 3-9) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Sri Lanka had been changing their side every match and Australia had already sent several men home, but like a well-heeled theatre troupe, the players that remained delivered the same performance they seemed to have given many times over this series. Sri Lanka won the toss again, batted again, did well for a little while, but mainly collapsed to a modest 128 for 9. Australia were disciplined with the ball, and athletic in the field, bruising at the top of their innings, a little shakier in the middle against spin, but got home with some comfort. The margin of this particular victory was four wickets, and they had 13 balls to spare - Glenn Maxwell providing the game's best innings again. If you have been following this series closely, though, this report may feel familiar.
