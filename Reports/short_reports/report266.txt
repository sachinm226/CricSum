Australia 4 for 556 dec (Khawaja 174, Warner 163, Voges 83*, Burns 71) and 4 for 264 dec (Burns 129, Warner 116, Craig 3-78) beat New Zealand 317 (Williamson 140, Starc 4-57, Johnson 3-105) and 295 (McCullum, 80, Williamson 59, Lyon 3-63) by 208 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia's vast victory over New Zealand in the Gabba Test was not achieved without some rancour on the final day, as umpiring decisions and a pesky last-wicket stand for the visitors caused some frustrations at the end of an otherwise commanding performance by the hosts. The steep and increasingly variable bounce of the pitch accounted for most of New Zealand's last seven wickets, while Nathan Lyon's growing fourth-innings expertise was demonstrated by his three wickets and constant threat to the batsmen. Brendon McCullum offered a typically defiant riposte but lacked support, and then found his innings ended by one of two umpiring calls that left a bitter taste in New Zealand mouths. However, there was evidence that McCullum's men would fight this series out as the last pair of Mark Craig and Trent Boult hammered a partnership of 46 that entertained the smallest of crowds while also causing the red mist to descend upon several Australian players. All this left Australia in possession of a 1-0 series lead but a feeling that New Zealand will be a more difficult proposition in the second Test at the WACA Ground next week, even if they have lost the allrounder Jimmy Neesham to a back ailment and will be in some doubt about being able to choose Tim Southee for Perth due to a similar problem.
