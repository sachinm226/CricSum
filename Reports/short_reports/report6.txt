Australia 153 for 4 (Wade 51*) beat West Indies 152 (Lewis 55*, Starc 3-43) by six wickets Led by a collective bowling display from their quicks and spinners, then finished by Matthew Wade's half-century, a significantly depleted Australia took the ODI series against West Indies with a four-wicket victory in Barbados on a surface where batting was a challenge throughout. Nicholas Pooran was bowled without offering a shot AFP Australia's trio of spinners - the recalled Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa and Ashton Turner - shared five wickets with the tally matched by Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood as West Indies could only muster 152 having had the chance to bat first. Evin Lewis, who returned after retiring hurt in the fourth over after a blow on the helmet, was the only batter to pass 18. The chase wobbled to begin with and the spin of Akeal Hosein and Hayden Walsh Jr threatened to undo Australia's good work in the field, but a calculated positive approach from Wade, Alex Carey and Mitchell Marsh paid dividends as the target was quickly whittled down despite the loss of wickets. Marsh's 29 off 21 balls with three sixes made considerable inroads until he fell in a Sheldon Cottrell over that cost 17 - a sizeable chunk of a small chase.
