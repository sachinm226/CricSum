Australia 8 for 179 (Warner 49) beat West Indies 8 for 141 (Ramdin 44, Nannes 3-21, Tait 3-30) by 38 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Warner was entertaining during his 49 Getty Images Shaun Tait and David Warner, two of Australia's Twenty20 specialists, continued the team's unbeaten summer by setting up a 38-run thrashing of West Indies in Hobart. Warner provided the early thrills with a brutal batting display before the Man of the Match Tait destroyed West Indies' top order as Australia's plans for the ICC World Twenty20 took a step in the right direction. Warner and Shane Watson lit up Bellerive Oval, which was hosting its first night international, by taking Australia to 0 for 83 in the eighth over and some late fireworks from Brad Haddin pushed them to 8 for 179. It was a good but gettable total, until two wickets in Tait's first over knocked the life out of the chase. Chris Gayle has failed to spark during the limited-overs portion of the summer and that trend continued when he swung wildly at Tait's fourth delivery and saw his stumps splayed.
