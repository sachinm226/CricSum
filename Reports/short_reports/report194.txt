Australia 181 for 4 (Smith 44, Tahir 2-38) beat South Africa 178 for 4 (Amla 97*, Coulter-Nile 2-36) by six wickets Live Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:47 'My goal to have a century in each format' - De Kock Hashim Amla's career-best 97 not out was not enough for South Africa to secure a series victory as Australia squeezed with spin and then attacked the opposition's slower bowlers to claim a 2-1 win in the T20I decider at Newlands. The result means that the same puzzle that has faced South Africa all summer remains unsolved. Their middle-order is still missing some reliability and they have yet to decide who to anoint as their fifth bowler. Australia, on the other hand, have answered some of their own questions. They found an opening combination that worked, their captain contributed a vital innings, and they were successful against spin on a surface that South Africa had asked to resemble a sub-continent strip as far as possible.
