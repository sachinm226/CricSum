Australians 277 for 9 (Stoinis 110, Finch 78, Archer 3-62) beat Sussex 220 (Salt 62, Evans 57, Agar 3-64) by 57 runs Scorecard There was the occasional mention of recent controversies from a sell-out crowd of 6000 as Hove - "If you like sandpaper clap your hands," was the tune of choice for some - but the toughest welcome for Australia as they returned to the field for the first time since leaving South Africa disgraced came in the middle as Sussex threatened to turn them over. In the end, Australia's attack came through - with help from some poor shot selection by Sussex - to secure a 57-run victory, a margin that flattered them somewhat. Marcus Stoinis' hundred, batting at No. 3, was the highlight for the Australians but their innings faltered badly from 167 for 1 after 30 overs while their pace attack looked thin as the lack of caps would suggest. "It's good to start a tour like that [with a hundred], but more importantly it's just fun to be out there with our mates," Stoinis said.
