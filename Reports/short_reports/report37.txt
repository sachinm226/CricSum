Australia 305 for 7 (Maxwell 108, Carey 106) beat England 302 for 7 (Bairstow 112, Billings 57, Woakes 53*) by three wickets Twin tons to Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey carried Australia past a precarious start to ensure a match and series victory against England in the final ODI at Emirates Old Trafford. Their 212-run partnership rescued the tourists from 73 for 5 and resigned England to their first bilateral ODI series defeat at home since 2015. Both fell in the dying stages, leaving it to Mitchell Starc to bring up the winning runs with a cool head and a swinging bat. The result overturned Jonny Bairstow's powerful century, which had lifted England to a commanding total from their own troubled beginning. Early wickets to Chris Woakes and an inspired turn by part-time spinner Joe Root had Australia in dire trouble in their pursuit of 303 before Maxwell's 108 off 90 balls and Carey's 106 sealed the series 2-1.
