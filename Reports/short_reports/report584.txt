The mess caused by the spectators was cleaned up before Australia swept to an 84-run victory ? AFP Ricky Ponting has condemned the crowd behaviour in St Vincent that delayed the end of the opening one-day international by ten minutes. West Indies were nine down when Darren Sammy was correctly given out bowled, but the trouble began after Sammy waited near the boundary while the television umpire reviewed the decision. There was no big screen at the stadium and when Sammy, who had 33, left the field the crowd threw bottles and rubbish on to the arena. The dismissal was initially unclear but the replays showed the ball had brushed off stump before bouncing off the wicketkeeper Brad Haddin's pads. During the crowd disturbance the Australians congregated on the pitch and were joined by James Hopes, who had been fielding on the boundary.
