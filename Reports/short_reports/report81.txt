England 258 (Burns 53, Bairstow 52, Hazlewood 3-58) and 258 for 5 dec (Stokes 115*, Cummins 3-35) drew with Australia 250 (Smith 92, Broad 4-65) and 154 for 6 (Labuschagne 59, Head 42*, Archer 3-32, Leach 3-37) In a match featuring such high drama, there had to be a twist or two. So there was as England dominated an Australia side missing the concussed Steven Smith, threatening to snatch victory via Jofra Archer's firebolts, but then being thwarted by some dogged batting by Smith's concussion substitute Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head as the second Test ended in a draw at Lord's. Smith was ruled out before play on the final day after waking up with symptoms of concussion, despite initial assessments having cleared him to resume his innings the previous day after suffering a nasty blow to the neck from an Archer bouncer. After rain delayed the start by more than an hour, the sun broke through to reveal a continuation of the thrilling contest this match had become after a washed-out opening day. Labuschagne, the first concussion replacement in Test history under playing conditions introduced on August 1, withstood more Archer barrages to score a half-century which was pivotal in helping Australia avoid defeat after Archer and Jack Leach had run through the tourists' top order.
