Australia 3 for 96 (Lynn 44, Maxwell 40*) beat New Zealand 9 for 117 (Tye 4-23, Stanlake 3-15) by seven wickets (DLS) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia launched the inaugural T20 Tri-series with an emphatic curtain-raising victory over New Zealand at Sydney, hunting down a rain-reduced target of 95 in 11.3 overs, after their bowlers had proven too aggressive and constraining for their meek opposition. Despite a top-order wobble, in which David Warner and the debutant D'Arcy Short fell inside the first three overs, the belligerent power of Chris Lynn and Glenn Maxwell soon assumed utter control of Australia's chase. With a series of scything blows, particularly through the covers, Lynn set the initial tempo, en route to 44 from 33 balls, while Maxwell soon found his own range with a ramped four over the keeper's head followed by a planted front-foot six off the medium pace of Colin de Grandhomme. Lynn picked up his solitary six of the night when he belted Mitchell Santner on the up through midwicket, but he eventually fell in pursuit of his second when, with eight runs required for victory, he scuffed a pull to backward square leg off a Trent Boult bouncer.
