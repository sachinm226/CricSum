Australia 197 for 7 (Head 96, Rashid 3-49) beat England 196 (Woakes 78, Cummins 4-24, Tye 3-33, Hazlewood 3-39) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For a match that appeared over inside 10 overs, Australia's first ODI victory since September did not come easy. The new-ball pair of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood filleted England's top order, but Chris Woakes' doughty rearguard and Adil Rashid's variations allowed the Australia Day ODI to creep into floodlit hours while Travis Head guided his team close to home. A slimmer-than-expected Adelaide Oval crowd of 24,329 seemed destined to be filing out of the exits early when Cummins and Hazlewood combined to have Eoin Morgan's side a sickly 5 for 8 as the new ball swung and seamed, before Woakes delivered his latest outstanding display of a series England had already won. Woakes' innings ensured that Australia needed at least one score of note to register their first ODI win since last year's India tour and only their second since January 2017, and it was Head, returning to the top of the order in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch, who provided it. His calm presence, laced with regular boundaries, contrasted with less certain innings from David Warner, Cameron White and the captain Steven Smith.
