Australia 0 for 41 v Pakistan 5 for 107 (Babar 59*) No result Australia's winning run in T20Is was halted by the Sydney weather when they were on track to take the opening match against Pakistan which had already been truncated by rain. Chasing a revised 119 in 15 overs, after Pakistan's innings was interrupted after 12.4 overs, Aaron Finch laid into Mohammad Irfan's second over which cost 26 runs - including two sixes and a no-ball that went for four - and put them well ahead in the chase, with the wicketless par score after five overs being 33. However, with 11 balls still needed to reach the five-over mark and constitute a match the rain returned. At the other end to Finch, David Warner didn't need to do much more than watch as he finished on 2 off 4 deliveries which extended his run of being unbeaten in T20Is.
