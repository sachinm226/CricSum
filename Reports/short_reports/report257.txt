Australians 312 for 9 (Cummins 82*, Marsh 68, Crook 3-38) drew with Northamptonshire 396 (Crook 142*, Coetzer 86, Duckett 50, Marsh 4-56) Scorecard Pat Cummins more than doubled his tally of first-class runs to avert embarrassment for the Australians Getty Images It's just as well for Australia that day one of this fixture was completely curtailed by rain. Had Northamptonshire been permitted a full allotment of time, they may well have been able to force a quite ludicrous victory over a baggy green XI performing listlessly against a second-string team from the lower tier of the County Championship. There is every chance that Chris Rogers will play his final Test match at The Oval next week. If so, events at Wantage Road gave some indication of exactly how much he will be missed by the remainder of the batting order. The display put on by the top order conveyed a near total lack of confidence about how to cope with even a mediocre bowling attack using the Dukes ball serviceably in overcast conditions.
