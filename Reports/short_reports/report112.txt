England 221 for 6 (Buttler 60, Hales 49, Roy 44) beat Australia 193 (Finch 84, Rashid 3-27, Jordan 3-42) Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details Jos Buttler thumped the fastest half-century in his nation's T20I history to help England withstand a brilliant innings from Aaron Finch and record another resounding victory against Australia at Edgbaston. The result, coming on the heels of England's 5-0 victory in the ODI series, means Australia have lost all six international fixtures as part of their tour to England and Wales. They depart for a tour of Zimbabwe on Thursday. Buttler, promoted to open the innings after an excellent end to his IPL season in the same position, thrashed 50 from just 22 balls as England posted the second-highest total in their 101-match T20 history. Their highest T20I score remains the 230 made against South Africa in Mumbai in 2016, while the previous record for fastest half-century was 23 set by Ravi Bopara.
