Australia 7 for 324 (Ponting 106, White 63) beat West Indies 8 for 274 (Deonarine 53, Pollard 62, Smith 58*) by 50 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ricky Ponting's 29th ODI century, his first at the Gabba, was the highlight of a record-breaking performance by Australia Getty Images Ricky Ponting sparkled with his 29th ODI century to lead Australia to a 50-run victory that sealed the series against West Indies. Ponting's side has out-played both touring teams this summer and the captain stepped up with an outstanding 106 as his side posted a ground-record 324. Even if Chris Gayle had fired his outfit would have found the chase difficult and when he went for 34 off 27 balls the game was gone. Narsingh Deonarine's maiden half-century kept the tourists going for a while before Kieron Pollard showed some muscle with a personal best of 62 and Dwayne Smith chipped in an unbeaten 58. With every dot ball the task got harder and they finished at 8 for 274.
