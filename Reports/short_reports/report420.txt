South Africa 388 and 8 for 248 (du Plessis 110*, Siddle 4-65, Lyon 3-49) drew with Australia 550 and 8 for 267 dec Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Faf du Plessis became the fourth South African to score a century on Test debut Getty Images Faf du Plessis would not have been playing in this Test were it not for JP Duminy hurting his Achilles tendon at the Gabba. And just as Duminy did on debut in Perth four years ago, du Plessis has grabbed his first chance at Test cricket to provide a remarkable result for the South Africans. At the WACA it was a near-record chase of 414 for victory; this time South Africa's challenge was to bat for four and a half sessions on a wearing Adelaide Oval pitch to salvage a draw. Thanks to du Plessis, they did so. Thanks to du Plessis, the scoreline remains at 0-0 heading into the decider in Perth, despite Australia having had the best of the first two Tests.
