Australia 3 for 551 dec (Khawaja 144, Smith 134*, Burns 128, Voges 106*) and 3 for 179 dec (Smith 70*, Khawaja 56) beat West Indies 271 (Bravo 81, C Barthwaite 59, Lyon 4-66, Pattinson 4-72) and 282 (Holder 68, Ramdin 59, Marsh 4-61, Lyon 3-85) by 177 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Slowly but surely, Australia worked their way through the West Indies for a victory that kept the Frank Worrell Trophy in their possession for 20 unbroken years, stretching back to the triumph of Mark Taylor's team in the Caribbean in 1995. Having fought hard over the final two days of the Test, West Indies lost their final four wickets for 32 in ten overs, allowing Steven Smith's team to enjoy success inside four days after they declared before play began to set Jason Holder's men a target of 460. With the benefit of more time in Australia, the visitors put up a better show than they managed in Hobart, though the hosts were never in any danger of losing the match. It was more a question of time, and Holder was despondent at a checked drive to mid-off that opened up the tail to the second new ball with a handful of overs remaining in the day. Mitchell Marsh claimed that wicket, and it was his fast-medium that did the majority of the damage for Smith.
