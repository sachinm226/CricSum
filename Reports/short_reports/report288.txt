Australia 494 for 7 dec and 303 for 5 dec beat South Africa 287 and 265 (Philander 51*, Harris 4-32, Johnson 3-92) by 245 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:53 Video report - A warrior to send off another Ryan Harris goes under the knife for knee surgery after this series - he does not know what the future holds. He may play Test cricket again, but at 34 there are no guarantees. Whatever happens, he has delivered one of the great triumphs in Australia's recent Test history, bowling the team to a series victory over South Africa, the world's No.1-ranked side, when it seemed almost inevitable that Graeme Smith would be farewelled by his men with a fighting, fitting draw. Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn batted together for 75 minutes as Australia sought the two remaining wickets they needed for victory and as the shadows grew longer, the looks on the faces of Michael Clarke and his men became more desperate.
