Australia 277 for 5 (White 106, Hussey 72*) beat Middlesex 273 for 5 (Shah 92, Newman 55*, Bollinger 3-24) by five wickets Scorecard Cameron White steadied Australia after a top-order wobble with a composed hundred PA Photos Cameron White hit 106 in a 176-run stand with Mike Hussey to rescue Australia from a top-order wobble as the visitors secured a hard-earned five-wicket victory against Middlesex, captained by Adam Gilchrist, at Lord's. After being made to sweat by Ireland on Thursday this wasn't a comfortable outing, either, as a rusty attack was taken for 273 before the reply slipped to 64 for 4. A little over a month ago Hussey played one of most extraordinary innings imaginable to take Australia home in the World Twenty20 semi-final against Pakistan in St Lucia, while White also played a vital hand in a run chase that seem impossible. The outcome of this match held far less significance and, having steadied the innings from the early wobble, the pair constructed their stand with consummate ease against a weak bowling line-up with the honourable exception of Tim Murtagh. Knowing the opposition were short of depth the pair didn't worry about the run rate and instead ticked over with good running, collecting the boundaries when they were on offer.
