New Zealand 184 for 5 (Conway 99*, Phillips 30, J Richardson 2-31) beat Australia 131 (Marsh 45, Sodhi 4-28, Southee 2-10, Boult 2-22) by 53 runs New Zealand utterly humiliated Australia's BBL XI in the opening T20I on the 10th anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake, hammering the tourists by 53 runs at Hagley Oval, the biggest ever margin of victory for them over their rivals across the Tasman in the shortest format of the international game. Devon Conway was calmness and poise personified to maintain his outstanding start to representing New Zealand, compiling an unbeaten 99 to lift his side to 184 for 5 after the Australians had made the swifter start to claim three wickets inside the first four overs. Australia's early success gave way to rather more pedestrian bowling and fielding during the back half of the innings. Chasing at least 20 runs more than they should have been, Aaron Finch's team were never a chance after being left completely bereft by the swinging new ball in the hands of Tim Southee and Trent Boult. Together, they reduced the Australians to 19 for 4, leaving the wrist spinner Ish Sodhi with a mop-up operation that handed him his best figures in T20Is.
