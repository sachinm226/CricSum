Australia 281 for 9 (Warner 69, Watson 66, Forrest 53, Russell 4-61, Roach 3-53) beat West Indies 251 (Sammy 84, Lee 3-42) by 30 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brett Lee's early strikes set Australia on the winning path Associated Press Somehow, a 2-2 draw seemed a fitting result for a series that was so closely fought. That was the outcome after Australia's best all-round performance of the tour so far finished in a 30-run win, although the West Indies captain Darren Sammy did his best to carry the hosts home on his shoulders with a powerful 84 that gave his team unexpected hope. But in the end, Australia had more performers: half-centuries to David Warner, Shane Watson and Peter Forrest set up a big total of 281 for 9 and Brett Lee led a disciplined bowling display to wrap up the victory. It left the series with a sense of symmetry: it began with an Australian win, then a West Indian victory, then a tie, then a West Indies win and ended as it started, with an Australian victory. It must also have left both teams unsatisfied, Australia at their inability to gel through the middle of the series and beat the No.
