Australia 9 for 559 dec (Warner 253, Khawaja 121) and 7 for 385 dec (Smith 138, Voges 119, Southee 4-97) drew with New Zealand 624 (Taylor 290, Williamson 166, Starc 4-119) and 2 for 104 (Johnson 2-20) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 3:23 Five takeaways from the WACA - It's Steven Smith's side to mould now There was no fairytale finish for Mitchell Johnson, but it was satisfying all the same. Johnson's final acts in Test cricket were to take two wickets in the last session as New Zealand's batsmen played out a draw, but it was a result that meant Australia retained the Trans-Tasman Trophy after their win in the first Test in Brisbane. Johnson departed from Test cricket to the cheers of his adopted home crowd, with 313 Test victims to his name. The WACA is a venue where Johnson has previously taken clumps of wickets quickly, sometimes late in the day, but New Zealand began the final session with all ten wickets in hand. Not even Johnson at his peak could have run through them in just one session, especially when bad light forced an early end to proceedings.
