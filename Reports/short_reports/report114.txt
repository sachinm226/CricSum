England 314 for 4 (Roy 101, Bairstow 79, Buttler 54*) beat Australia 310 for 8 (Marsh 101, Finch 100, Head 63, Willey 4-43) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England have given themselves a great opportunity to inflict their first 5-0 ODI series whitewash on Australia after a six-wicket victory in Durham with 32 deliveries remaining. The result gave England a 4-0 lead with one game - in Manchester on Sunday - to play. It also meant that England have won eight of their last nine ODIs against Australia who have, in turn, won only two of their last 17 ODIs. While England won 4-0 in 2012, the third game in the series was lost to rain. It tells you how much ODI cricket has changed - and how quickly - that England's victory in this match seemed all but inevitable from the first moments of their chase.
