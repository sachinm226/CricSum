Australia 2 for 118 (Marsh 69*) beat Bangladesh 117 (Johnson 3-17) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Dhiman Ghosh provided a few highlights for Bangladesh but his innings was short-lived ? Getty Images Bangladesh improved marginally but still lost by eight wickets in Darwin, where Australia's bowlers set up an unassailable 2-0 series lead. Once again weighed down by batting lapses, Bangladesh struggled to 117 against an unforgiving attack and then found Shaun Marsh and his top-order colleagues equally merciless as they completed the chase within 23 overs. They wrapped up the result by 2.45pm, a time when most one-day internationals in Australia have barely started. Marsh finished unbeaten on 69 and firmed as a permanent opener in the limited-overs outfit.
