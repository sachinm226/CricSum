West Indies 6 for 191 (Charles 57, Faulkner 3-28) beat Australia 8 for 164 (Voges 51, Pollard 3-30, Narine 2-19) by 27 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Johnson Charles was in fine form once again Getty Images Three days ago, Johnson Charles scored his first international hundred but couldn't stop an Australian victory. This time, a brisk Charles half-century was enough to set West Indies on the way to their first win over Australia in Australia in any format for 16 years, as they showed why they are the reigning Twenty20 world champions. Australia might have swept the ODIs 5-0, but West Indies will at least fly home on a happier note. They had not beaten Australia in this country since the Perth Test in February 1997. The only man from that contest involved in this drought-breaking match was Paul Reiffel, then a fast bowler, now an umpire.
