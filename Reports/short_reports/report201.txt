Australia 288 for 6 (Warner 109, Khawaja 59, Smith 52*) beat South Africa 252 (Du Plessis 63, Amla 60, Starc 3-43, Zampa 3-52, Hazlewood 3-52) by 36 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details If there is any venue outside Australia where David Warner should feel at home it is the ground in Basseterre on the island of St Kitts. It is tailor-made for him with its short boundaries and hard surface. It is even named Warner Park. In his first international match at his namesake venue, Warner struck his sixth ODI hundred, and first outside Australia, to set up a 36-run victory over South Africa. Australia thus became the first team to win two games in this tri-series, which has now moved on from the slow, spinning surfaces of Guyana.
