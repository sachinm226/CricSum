Australia 227 for 8 (Bailey 70, Wade 42) beat Sri Lanka 226 (Chandimal 102, Zampa 3-38) by 2 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There were reasons for Sri Lankan fans to cheer at the third ODI in Dambulla. But the result wasn't one of them. On a day when Tillakaratne Dilshan was farewelled from one-day international cricket, and Dinesh Chandimal scored his fourth ODI hundred, Australia held on for a tense victory that gave them a 2-1 series lead with two to play - and gave David Warner a 100% success rate as an international captain. Not that it was all smooth sailing. Chasing 227, Australia relatively cruised most of the way.
