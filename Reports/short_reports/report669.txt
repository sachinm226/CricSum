Australia 5 for 221 (Gilchrist 48, Ponting 47, White 40*) beat England 9 for 144 (Dalrymple 32) by 77 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out - Australia How they were out - England Man of the Match: Cameron White launches another clean strike ? Getty Images Australia showed no mercy as they crushed England by 77 runs in the Twenty20 at Sydney after piling up the largest total at international level. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White blitzed the hapless attack after the early momentum was created by Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting and they reached 5 for 221. Two wickets in the first two overs of England's chase - including Andrew Flintoff for a duck - ended the contest apart from the interest surrounding Michael Vaughan. England were in the match for about one over and from the moment James Anderson's first six balls went for 14 a huge total was on the cards. The sixth-wicket stand of 66 off 34 balls left the full house in raptures and England had no choice but to tee off from the start of their chase.
