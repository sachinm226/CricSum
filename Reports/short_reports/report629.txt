Australia 200 for 5 (Gilchrist 72, Watson 55) beat England 197 (Vaughan 62, Bell 56, Tait 4-33) by five wickets Scorecard Adam Gilchrist's 72 was too much for England ? AFP Adam Gilchrist and Shane Watson helped Australia to settle a score emphatically against England after their recent whitewash in the CB Series finals. The opening pair put on 140 to take Australia to a five-wicket victory, chasing down 198 with ease in the 41st over. England squandered a decent start from Ian Bell and Michael Vaughan as they lost 9 for 75 and ended up with a modest total. Watson's claims for the opener's spot will have been enhanced by his rapid 55 off 68 balls, while Gilchrist showed a return to form after missing the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, making 72 from 82. England's fielders looked sloppy - and their heads quickly went down - but it was a sharp catch by Kevin Pietersen, low at gully, which finally dismissed Watson.
