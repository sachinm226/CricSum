West Indies 172 for 3 (Gayle 88, Fletcher 53) beat Australia 169 for 7 (Warner 63, David Hussey 27, Bravo 2-31) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Chris Gayle hit perhaps the biggest six seen at The Oval, during his 50-ball 88 Getty Images Don't call this an upset.

They fielded pathetically but that characteristic trait was sandwiched between superb opening bowling and explosive batting.
