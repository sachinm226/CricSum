No result New Zealand 291 (Williamson 100, Ronchi 65, Hazlewood 6-52) v Australia 53 for 3 Scorecard and ball-by-ball details History never repeats, the iconic New Zealand band Split Enz would have us believe. Turns out they didn't know what they were talking about. History very much repeated on Friday at Edgbaston, where back in 2013 Australia and New Zealand had met in a Champions Trophy group match. On that occasion, the first innings was completed and the chase was underway when rain washed the game away. And this year? Ditto.
