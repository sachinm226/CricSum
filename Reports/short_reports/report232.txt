India 4 for 331 (Pandey 104*, Rohit 99, Dhawan 78, Hastings 3-61) beat Australia 7 for 330 (Warner 122, Mitchell Marsh 102*, Bumrah 2-40, Ishant 2-60) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:58 Chappell: Hundred will give Pandey more belief Manish Pandey and MS Dhoni, rising star and fading force, combined to deliver India victory over Australia at the last possible opportunity in another run-fest at the SCG. Having crumpled in a humiliating heap in Canberra, the tourists were able to hold their nerve this time, helped by a pair of critical Australian dropped catches. David Warner and Mitchell Marsh had made centuries for Australia, but the allrounder conceded 13 from the final over of the night to allow the visitors avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 series sweep. It also provided partial vindication of Dhoni's longtime belief in seeing out an innings, even if his steady 34 was a diminished version of supreme closing displays he used to be able to put together for his team. Australia were denied an unbeaten home summer.
