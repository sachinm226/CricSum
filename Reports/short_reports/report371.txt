India 6 for 270 (Gambhir 92, Dhoni 44*) beat Australia 8 for 269 (Hussey 72, Forrest 66) by four wickets Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details India's chase was anchored by Gautam Gambhir's fluent 92 AFP A supremely calm MS Dhoni guided India to victory, with two balls to spare, over a sluggish Australia in the ODI at Adelaide Oval. Dhoni's composure was best measured by how he paced his innings. It bordered on the statuesque early, before he raised tempo with swift running between the wickets. He saved his one stroke to the boundary - a towering six over long on - for when he most needed it: the third ball of the final over delivered by Clint McKay, which began with 13 still required. The next ball was a high full toss that Dhoni swung to deep midwicket, but the no-ball - called for height - gifted India a third run in addition to the two scampered between the wickets.
