Pakistan 194 for 7 (Fakhar 73, Asif 37*, Tye 3-35) beat Australia 149 for 7 (Carey 37*, Shaheen Afridi 3-37) by 45 runs Pakistan gained a mental advantage over Australia by dominating Aaron Finch's team in a match that served as a dress rehearsal for Sunday's Twenty20 triangular tournament final at the Harare Sports Club. Having beaten Pakistan comfortably in their first meeting, the Australians put in an unfocused performance, dropping far too short with the new ball after Finch sent Sarfraz Ahmed's side in to bat to allow Fakhar Zaman to fire off a succession of pull shots on his way to the highest score of the match. They then lost a series of early wickets to the late moving ball in the hands of Faheem Ashraf and the 18-year-old left-armer Shaheen Afridi. Having slid as low as 75 for 5, Australia never looked likely to get close to their target, though the wicketkeeper and vice-captain Alex Carey played another intelligent innings down the order. Pakistan's victory also served the purpose of preventing Australia from taking their place at the top of the ICC's T20 international rankings.
