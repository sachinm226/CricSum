South Africa 6 for 288 (Amla 97, Duminy 60*, de Villiers 60, Hopes 3-44) beat Australia 249 (M Hussey 78, Haddin 63, Tsotsobe 4-50) by 39 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Hashim Amla scored his second consecutive half-century ? AFP South Africa's near-perfect tour began with a Test win in Perth and fittingly it finished with a one-day triumph at the same venue as Australia conceded the No. 1 ranking to Johan Botha's men. JP Duminy, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers, all of whom contributed to the Test successes, finished the trip strongly and the debutant Lonwabo Tsotsobe picked up four wickets to give the tourists one more happy story to recount on the flight home. When South Africa arrived in Australia in December, they fancied their chances in the Tests but felt they still had a lot of improving to do in the shorter format. It's not unusual for holidaymakers to head back to their own country with a fresh perception of the world and that's exactly what South Africa will take home thanks to their 4-1 result and new No.
