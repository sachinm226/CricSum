Australia 81 for 5 (Warner 40, Hodge 21*, Duminy 2-5) beat South Africa 80 for 1 (De Kock 41*, du Plessis 27*) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Warner's 40 helped Australia to victory Getty Images Brad Hodge clubbed the third and fourth deliveries of the last over over deep midwicket to haul Australia home in a seven-over shootout against South Africa in Durban. Steady rain had threatened successive washouts in the series but relented to allow a sizeable crowd some action. Australia needed 15 going into the final over and Wayne Parnell conceded only a run each off the first two deliveries, but Hodge was to seal it with two balls to spare, the couple of sixes followed by one called wide for height. David Warner was South Africa's tormentor again at the start of the chase, as he and Aaron Finch took 21 off Lonwabo Tsotsobe's first over. Warner then hit debutant Beuran Hendricks for three successive boundaries in the third over as Australia surged to 44 for 1 in three overs.
