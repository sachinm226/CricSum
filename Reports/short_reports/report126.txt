Pakistan 147 for 6 (Babar 45, Hafeez 40, Coulter-Nile 3-18) beat Australia 136 for 8 (Maxwell 52, Shadab 2-30) by 11 runs It will take something truly special to put an end to this purple patch Pakistan are basking in as far as T20I cricket is concerned. As another top-order collapse saw Australia fall short by 11 runs, it became patently obvious this particular visiting side aren't that special someone. Pakistan, again, weren't at their very best with the bat, and it was only a string of medium-sized scores that took them to 147. But it was in the field that their swagger was on full display, with an exceptional bowling performance - and at times an even better fielding one - snuffing out Australia's chances. It was a final result that made the game look closer than it really was.
