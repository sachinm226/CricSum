Bangladesh 127 for 9 (Mahmudullah 52, Ellis 3-34, Hazlewood 2-16) beat Australia 117 for 4 (Marsh 51, McDermott 35, Shoriful 2-29) by ten runs Bangladesh marched to an unassailable 3-0 lead to register their first series win against Australia across formats by defending 128 in a close finish during the third T20I in Dhaka. While Mahmudullah led from the front by scoring 52 and batting deep to ensure the hosts had some firepower left late in the innings, Mustafizur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan and Nasum Ahmed combined to apply the brakes on Australia's run chase. Debutant Nathan Ellis' hat-trick went in vain for the visitors, for whom Mitchell Marsh continued his fine form and contributed 51, while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa chipped in with the ball. The Fizz delivers again Rahman followed figures of 2 for 16 and 3 for 23 in the series with an exceptional return of 0 for 9 from his four overs. In what was the joint second-most economical effort for a Bangladesh bowler in a completed spell, Rahman turned the game around when he conceded just a single in the 19th over of the Australia innings when they needed an entirely possible 23 from 12 balls with Alex Carey and Dan Christian at the crease.
