Pakistan A 305 for 8 dec (Shafiq 108*) and 306 for 3 dec (Azam 114*, Sohail 103*) beat Australians 273 for 8 dec (Doolan 104) and 185 (Hughes 65, Talha 3-32, Hasan 3-60) by 153 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Phillip Hughes was keen to sweep and pull the spinners Getty Images Phillip Hughes scored a half-century but Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers missed out on their last chance for some decent time in the middle ahead of the first Test, as Pakistan A wrapped up a 153-run victory in the tour game in Sharjah. The result was not so much the issue for the Australians as giving players the chance for some match practice; on that front the last day was disappointing as well. Mitchell Marsh, who had made a third-ball duck in the first innings, stuck around for 35 from 54 deliveries as his audition for a Test debut gradually improved, but he was unable to post an attention-grabbing score. Most notably, Clarke and Rogers, who watched on in the ODI series, both fell cheaply for the second time in the game, meaning they will enter the Test without any real local form behind them. Clarke, on the comeback trail from a hamstring problem, promoted himself to No.
