Australia 358 for 5 (Hodge 123, Clarke 93*, Gilchrist 57) beat The Netherlands 129 (Hogg 4-27) by 229 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Brad Hodge bludgeoned his way to a maiden ODI hundred, hitting eight fours and seven sixes ? AFP The minnow-bashing was not as brutal as South Africa's, but Australia motored along like a well-oiled machine and exploded during the final overs to bat The Netherlands out of the match with 358 for 5. After being stranded in the nineties twice this year, Brad Hodge reached his maiden one-day hundred during what was a perfectly paced innings. Defending 359 was always going to be a cake walk and Australia's battery of fast bowlers was too hot for The Netherlands to handle and they were skittled for 129. The pitch was a belter and Ricky Ponting jumped at the chance of more batting practice. Adam Gilchrist provided the propulsion at the start, but once Australia lost him and Ponting with the score on 116, Michael Clarke and Hodge were impossible to contain during their partnership of 204.
