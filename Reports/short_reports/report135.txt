South Africa 5 for 320 (Miller 139, du Plessis 125) beat Australia 9 for 280 (Marsh 106, Stoinis 63, Rabada 3-40, Steyn 3-45) by 40 runs Captain Faf du Plessis joined the powerful David Miller for the biggest partnership in ODIs between South Africa and Australia to clinch the series in a high-scoring affair at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The duo took the visitors comfortably out of reach of a doughty chasing effort by Shaun Marsh, who struck his sixth ODI century. Having lost three early wickets after being sent in by Aaron Finch, du Plessis and Miller provided a model exhibition of how to build a dominant position from modest beginnings, getting well established through steady accumulation before accelerating in brutal fashion in the closing overs of the innings. Their stand of 252 surpassed a union of 222 between Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan, at Docklands in 2000, as the biggest ever stand in Australia v South Africa ODIs. Both batsmen gathered momentum but offered contrasting styles and preferred scoring areas to give the Australian bowlers no end of headaches.
