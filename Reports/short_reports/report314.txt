Sri Lanka 5 for 138 (Mathews 35*) beat Australia 3 for 137 (Warner 90*, Voges 25*) by 5 wickets Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Warner was almost solely responsible for a defensible Australian total Associated Press Sri Lanka's collective effort was enough to overcome an Australian team that left far too much up to David Warner on their National Day with the visitors claiming a five-wicket victory on a pudding of a drop-in pitch at Sydney's Olympic Stadium. After their bowlers had been brilliantly supported in the field to restrict Australia to 3 for 137 - of which Warner made no fewer than 90 - the Sri Lankans made a rapid start to the chase and then steadied against the loss of mid-innings wickets to take a 1-0 lead with seven balls to spare. Angelo Mathews showed the cool head that has him marked as his nation's long-term leader to finish off the innings. There were cameos, too, from Kushal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne and Thisara Perera, all of whom will be happy that Sri Lanka cannot now lose this series after also tying the ODI matches. Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera were both exemplary with the ball, though Kulasekara undid much of his good work by turfing the simplest of chances at deep midwicket when Warner had made only 69.
