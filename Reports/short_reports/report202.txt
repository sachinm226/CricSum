South Africa 189 for 9 (Behardien 62, Maxwell 2-15, Hazlewood 2-20) beat Australia 142 (Finch 72, Rabada 3-13) by 47 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details South Africa posted only one run more than the 188 they had managed in their triangular series opener against hosts West Indies but it was enough to give them a first win in three meetings against Australia in the Caribbean. The 47-run victory meant that the Guyana leg of the tournament ended with all three teams securing points. Farhaan Behardien's fifth ODI half-century helped South Africa recover from 112 for 6 but it was the bowlers who took them to the win. Fielding an attack that included three specialist spinners for the first time in five years - since their World Cup clash against Bangladesh in 2011 - South Africa allowed only Aaron Finch to score more than 30. Particularly impressive was chinaman bowler Tabraiz Shamsi, who made his debut and threatened a wicket with every ball.
