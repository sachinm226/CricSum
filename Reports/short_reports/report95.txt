Australia 416 (Labuschagne 143, Head 56, Wagner 4-92, Southee 4-93) and 9-217 declared (Burns 53, Labuschagne 50, Southee 5-69, Wagner 3-59) beat New Zealand 166 (Taylor 80, Starc 5-52) and 171 (Watling 40, Starc 4-45, Lyon 4-63) by 296 runs Disciplined and determined where Pakistan were mercurial and chaotic, New Zealand succumbed to much the same fate nonetheless at Perth Stadium, as Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon and Pat Cummins delivered a yawning victory for Australia and a 1-0 lead in the Trans-Tasman series with the Boxing Day and New Year's Tests to come. Tim Paine's Australians will be delighted not only to have wrapped up a 296-run win over Kane Williamson's men inside four days, but also to have done so despite losing Josh Hazlewood after the New South Welshman had bowled a mere eight deliveries for the match. James Pattinson looks highly likely to replace Hazlewood for the MCG, though the coach Justin Langer has already hinted that five bowlers may well be chosen in expectation of a "play it safe" pitch after last week's abandoned Sheffield Shield game. Either way, Starc, Cummins and Lyon will take some stopping, having rolled New Zealand twice for little more than 300 runs on an excellent Perth pitch that offered runs for quality batting but also provided plenty of pace, bounce and eventual deterioration for the bowlers. And as well as the tourists bowled to Australia, particularly David Warner and Steven Smith, they were left with plenty of hard evidence that Paine's men have decided advantages in depth and suitability to the prevailing conditions.
