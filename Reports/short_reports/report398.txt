England 252 for 4 (Bopara 82, Bell 75) beat Australia 251 for 7 (Watson 66, Hussey 65, Bresnan 2-50) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ian Bell made passed 50 for the third time in his last four ODI innings Getty Images It is one of the ironies of England's recent resurgence in all formats of the game that, for all their meticulous planning, two of the crucial ingredients of their success have come through luck. Just as it was only the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores as captain that brought Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss together as captain and coach, so it has only been the "retirement" of Pietersen from limited-overs international cricket that presented another chance to Ian Bell as an ODI batsman. It is not just luck, of course. It is how England have adjusted to circumstance and overcome the obstacles that have arisen. But it remains true that, had Pietersen not departed the England limited-overs set-up recently, it is most unlikely that Bell would have returned to the top of the England order.
