Australia 2 for 171 (Ponting 57*, Watson 53) beat West Indies 170 (Smith 43, Bollinger 4-28) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson got Australia off to a strong start in the chase with a smooth 53 Getty Images After the match was effectively sealed from the first ball when Chris Gayle fell, Australia ran over a disappointing West Indies for an eight-wicket victory to earn a 2-0 lead. The tourists were out-classed by Doug Bollinger in the early stages and slumped to 4 for 16 before scrambling to 170, a total which was never going to be large enough. Australia were not intimidated and Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting skipped to half-centuries as the win came in the 27th over. West Indies actually did well to last as long as 39.4 overs in their innings in a poorly timed performance given the current debate over the relevance of the 50-over game.
