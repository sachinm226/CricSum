Australia 377 (Warner 123, Handscomb 82, Smith 58, Mustafizur 4-84) and 87 for 3 (Maxwell 25*) beat Bangladesh 305 (Mushfiqur 68, Sabbir 66, Lyon 7-94) and 157 (Lyon 6-60) by seven wickets History beckoned for Bangladesh this week, but it was the indefatigable Nathan Lyon who chose Chittagong to make plenty of his own and thus earn Australia a share of the series on a dramatic fourth day. Asian Test matches often move slowly before reaching a quick conclusion, and the visitors showed how much their knowledge of the game in this part of the world has grown by seizing the moment to pressure Bangladesh and emerge victorious with no little flourish. A sensational collapse from the hosts left Australia a target of 86 to level the series AFP Peter Handscomb and Glenn Maxwell took charge of a small target in fading light, after Lyon had made the sprint finish possible by scooping his third six-wicket haul in succession and scooping up a hatful of records in the process. Not least of these was the best haul by an Australian bowler in a two match series, a terrific 22 wickets, surpassing spin luminaries such as Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill. ICC Test team rankings 1.
