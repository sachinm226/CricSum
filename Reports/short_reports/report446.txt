Sri Lankan Board XI 258 (Chandimal 59, Copeland 5-47) and 174 for 2 (Thirimanne 100*) drew with Australians 393 (Hughes 76, Khwaja 101, Clarke 104) Scorecard Michael Clarke retired after reaching his century AFP Lahiru Thirimanne pressed for a berth in Sri Lanka's team for the first Test with an unbeaten 100 for the Board XI against the Australians on the final day of the tour match. His determined and at times handsome innings also served to cloud Australia's spin bowling plans for the first Test at Galle, as neither Michael Beer nor Nathan Lyon were able to pose too great a threat on a pitch that offered sizeable rough and some sharp turn. The Australians had been bowled out for 393, the captain Michael Clarke retiring after a suave 104, before the Board XI sailed smoothly to 174 for 2 by the time the teams agreed to an early close at about 4pm local time. Trent Copeland, with 1 for 14, and Ryan Harris again looked the tourists' most likely bowlers, though Lyon (1 for 51) was able to claim the wicket of Thilan Samaraweera. Beer was the more economical of the pair, leaving the selectors a choice between promise and parsimony.
