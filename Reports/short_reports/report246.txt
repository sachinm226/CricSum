Australians 507 for 8 dec (S Marsh 114, Smith 111, Rogers 84, Clarke 56, Hunn 5-99) and 322 for 4 dec (M Marsh 101, Watson 81) beat Kent 280 (Key 87, Johnson 4-56) and 294 (Bell-Drummond 127, Claydon 53, Smith 3-54) by 255 runs Scorecard 1:15 Bell-Drummond steals the limelight for a day Victory soon after tea, runs and wickets for pretty much everyone and an ahead-of-schedule bus departure for Essex made this a more or less perfect warm-up fixture for the Australians. Even so, a few kinks remain to be ironed out at Chelmsford, not least those exposed by a bold and brilliant century from Daniel Bell-Drummond, very much the coming man around these parts. Rather like Steven Smith on his first contact with England's Test team, Bell-Drummond did not make a great first impression when he was moved around the crease then struck in front of the stumps by Mitchell Johnson to depart for a duck inside the first over of Kent's reply to a hefty 507 for 8 declared. On that evidence he did not look too likely to assemble the 100-Test career Rob Key has forecast for him. This time, however, he was quickly into stride, capitalising on the merest errors in line and length from Ryan Harris and Fawad Ahmed in particular - no fewer than 90 of his 127 runs were carved from the offerings of those two bowlers.
