South Africa 289 for 6 (de Villiers 80, Kallis 70, Johnson 4-34) beat Australia 264 for 7 (Ferguson 63, Hopes 63*) by 25 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Callum Ferguson tried to retrieve a lost cause but the pressure had already told on Australia Associated Press "We need to break the hoodoo," was how Graeme Smith went into this match with both teams 1-1 in the five-game series. After losing every toss against Ricky Ponting over the summer, Smith finally won one and South Africa piled up 289 on a track that wasn't always conducive to batting. Then the bowlers and fielders struck early in the piece and despite a spirited rear-guard effort took a one-game lead. Even a floodlight failure couldn't dim South Africa. Two days ago Ponting blamed himself for Australia's batting predicament, saying it was about time he scored another century.
