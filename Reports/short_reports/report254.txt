England 182 for 5 (Morgan 74, Moeen 72) beat Australia 177 for 8 (Smith 90) by five runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details In years to come, people will look at the scorecard of this match and presume that Ben Stokes - with modest bowling figures and a peripheral figure with the bat - played nothing more than a supporting role in this game. But Stokes, with an outstanding catch and a nerveless final over, played a key part in an England victory that continues a remarkable summer that promised little more than pain and has delivered more promise and encouragement than even the most optimistic supporters could have anticipated. After a grim 2014 when they lost nine of their 12 T20Is, including a wretched World T20 campaign, new-look England have now won three in a row and have defeated the No. 2 ranked side. Their limited-overs resurgence, a development that looked most unlikely when they were knocked out of the World Cup at the first hurdle only a few months ago, continues.
