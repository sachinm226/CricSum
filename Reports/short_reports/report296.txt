Pakistan 454 (Sarfraz 109, Younis 106) and 286 for 2 dec (Shehzad 131, Younis 103*) beat Australia 303 (Warner 133) and 216 (Johnson 61, Smith 55, Babar 5-74, Yasir 4-50) by 221 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 5:04 Zulfiqar Babar picked up 5 for 74 Getty Images Not since 1994 have Pakistan led Australia in a Test series. A telling 221-run victory in Dubai means that Misbah-ul-Haq's wonderfully resilient team are now a chance of breaking an identical 20-year drought between series wins over the same opponent. Pakistan proved far more skilful, resourceful and focused than Australia, who missed Ryan Harris and Shane Watson rather more than Misbah's men suffered for the absence of Saeed Ajmal and Junaid Khan. The Australia lower order battled manfully but could not erase the sins of the top six, who apart from David Warner failed utterly in conditions that have become an all too familiar source of trouble. Zulfiqar Babar and Yasir Shah were the fourth-innings architects of Pakistan's triumph, their expertise and subtlety providing a reminder that most spin bowlers are forged in first-class cricket and are invariably better for experience.
