Australia 97 for 4 (Warner 53*, Hasan 2-17) beat Pakistan 96 for 9 (Maxwell 3-13, Boyce 2-10) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia struck regularly to keep Pakistan to 96 for 9 AFP Glenn Maxwell spun out the first three Pakistan wickets on a slow turner as the hosts limped to 96 and lost the only T20 international to Australia by six wickets. Had it not been for 20 extras, the second-highest contributor to the innings after debutant Saad Nasim's 25, Pakistan would have struggled to get anywhere close to 100. Pakistan's spinners, in the absence of the banned Saeed Ajmal, hit back to have Australia 56 for 4, but David Warner sealed the chase in 14 overs with an unbeaten 53 off 39. Shahid Afridi had expected the pitch to play slow and low but it also had plenty of turn, as his top order was to find out after he chose to bat. Pakistan went too hard too soon, and Maxwell made them pay.
