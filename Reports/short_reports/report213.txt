Australia 199 for 1 (Khawaja 82*, Smith 59*) beat Ireland 198 (Anderson 39, Zampa 3-37) by nine wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Adam Zampa's spell of 3 for 37 saw him become the leading ODI wicket-taker of the year AFP Ireland's highest score in five meetings against Australia was not enough to even mildly challenge the top-ranked ODI side, who eased to victory with 19.5 overs to spare in a chase of 199. What will sting Ireland most is that they could have done much better. They squandered the chance to post a competitive total with a mid-innings collapse that took them from 121 for 2 to 146 for 6, and lost their last eight wickets for 77 runs. None of their batsmen touched 40 while the three batsmen Australia needed all scored more than that.
