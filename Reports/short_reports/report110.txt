South Africa 382 (De Villiers 126*, Elgar 57, Amla 56, Cummins 3-79) and 102 for 4 beat Australia 243 (Warner 63, Rabada 5-96, Ngidi 3-51) and 239 (Khawaja 75, Rabada 6-54) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The hardest job on day four in Port Elizabeth was not chasing 101 for victory. Through the majesty of AB de Villiers, South Africa did that with ease and levelled the series 1-1. No, the most difficult task was assigned to whoever chose the Man of the Match. Would it be de Villiers, whose unbeaten 126 in the first innings was not only a game-changer but one of the most impressive knocks in recent history, and whose run-a-ball 28 in the second innings helped seal the win? Or would it be Kagiso Rabada, whose 11-wicket haul was irresistible to watch and completely blunted Australia's batting? Certainly it was Rabada who lit up the morning session at St George's Park. South Africa began the day clearly in the stronger position, but Australia were 41 runs ahead and still had five wickets in hand.
