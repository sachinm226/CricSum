Australia 198 for 7 (Clarke 66, Ferguson 41, Gul 3-38, Afridi 2-31) beat Pakistan 171 (Butt 48, Shehzad 40, Clarke 3-15, Hauritz 2-25 ) by 27 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Michael Clarke's return to form couldn't have come at a better moment Associated Press Pakistan's propensity to self-destruct cost them the lead in this series in dramatic manner, a batting collapse against spin handing Australia an improbable win. Michael Clarke, the Australian captain, turned in a superb all-round performance with a gritty 66 in the face of some penetrative spin bowling before picking up 3 for 15 amid Pakistan's middle-order chaos. His spin partners, Nathan Hauritz and Andrew Symonds, helped defend a below-par score of 198 as Pakistan fell short by 27 runs. Spinners have been making headlines in the IPL in South Africa and the story today wasn't any different in the northern hemisphere. Pakistan's own spin trio strangled the runs and picked up three wickets and, by the time their openers Salman Butt and Ahmed Shehzad added 95, the hosts looked set for a series lead.
