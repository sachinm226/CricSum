Australia 184 for 5 (Warner 72, Watson 54) beat India 135 (Rohit 79*, Tait 3-21, Nannes 3-25) by 49 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Hawk-eye David Warner had fun at the expense of Ravindra Jadeja AFP The match started with a maiden. Silence before a storm that absolutely blew India out of its way. Six-hitting has seldom been made to look easier: David Warner and Shane Watson just kept clearing their front legs, creating room, and kept lofting the Indians over various parts of the Kensington Oval. Finding gaps and all they didn't care about. Between them they hit 13 sixes and only three fours, and by the time they were done, 142 runs had been scored in 14 overs.
