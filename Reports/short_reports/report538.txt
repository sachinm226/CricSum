South Africa 156 for 5 (van der Merwe 48, Peterson 34, Harwood 2-21) beat Australia 139 for 8 (Hussey 27, Clarke 27, Botha 2-16) by 17 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out South Africa were saved by the brutal contribution of Roelof van der Merwe in the twilight overs AFP The South Africans continue to dominate the limited-overs formats. Having usurped Australia for top place in the 50-over rankings last year, South Africa now head to the World Twenty20 brimming with confidence after a second consecutive 20-over victory over Ricky Ponting's men, this time by 17 runs. The Australians seldom appeared comfortable in pursuit of South Africa's 156 for 5 on a pitch that troubled batsmen from both sides of the Indian Ocean. Michael Clarke (27 runs from 33 balls) struggled to combat South Africa's disciplined lines, while Ricky Ponting was dismissed for a solitary run for the second time in three days; this time to a well-angled delivery from debutant paceman Yusuf Abdulla. Hardly an ideal start.
