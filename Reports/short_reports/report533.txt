No result - New Zealand 6 for 123 (Guptill 64*) Australia 4 for 168 (Haddin 88*, Ferguson 55*) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Brad Haddin led Australia with a fine half-century in a match decided by the weather ? Getty Images Australia clung to the Chappell-Hadlee Series despite a brave push from New Zealand after the final game was spoilt by rain. Martin Guptill's fighting half-century was in vain as the visitors finished at 6 for 123; they were ahead on Duckworth-Lewis but needed to make the target of 156 in 20 overs to qualify the contest as a match. The result left the series drawn at 2-2 and Australia kept the prize after their win in 2007-08. It was a sad end for New Zealand after a day that swung from saturated to soggy and slippery. New Zealand started their innings after Australia's 4 for 168 and relied on Guptill, who blasted his half-century from only 24 balls.
