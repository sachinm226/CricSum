Australians 562 (Marsh 169, Nevill 78, Warner 94, Watson 52) and 221 (Clarke 77, Porter 3-42) beat Essex 414 (Westley 144, Bopara 107, Starc 6-51) and 200 (ten Doeschate 61, Hazlewood 4-42, Starc 3-26) by 169 runs Scorecard 1:51 Australia quicks lift after news of Harris retirement As confirmation of Ryan Harris' retirement filtered around Chelmsford, Jesse Ryder was collaring Josh Hazlewood for 26 runs from the young paceman's first over. The Australians looked understandably flat, having taken in an emotional address from Harris barely an hour before. Professional sport, though, is about pushing through all distractions and preparing for what lies ahead. The fact that Harris will not be going there with them made it imperative for others to step forward, and Hazlewood duly regathered himself after Ryder's early blows to help round up Essex and complete a second comfortable Australian victory in as many tour matches. Mitchell Starc was also effective, and if there was a slightly apologetic air about the way the Australians celebrated their wickets, it was at least partly because they arrived with increasing regularity in the afternoon.
