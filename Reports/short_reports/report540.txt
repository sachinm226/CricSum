South Africa 651 (de Villiers 163, Prince 150, Kallis 102) beat Australia 209 (Katich 55, Steyn 4-56) and 422 (Johnson 123*, McDonald 68, Katich 54, Harris 6-127) by an innings and 20 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Mitchell Johnson's maiden century was a stirring affair and gave South Africa palpitations before they eventually won AFP Minor lapses in concentration were always going to be crucial on a day like this. For two sessions it was Australia who paid for erring, and in the final it was South Africa - having stuck to their task so well until tea - who relaxed and looked on in bewilderment as centurion Mitchell Johnson and Andrew McDonald thumped a rearguard of dizzying proportions. In the end, however, Australia were unable to overcome a massive deficit and fell to an innings defeat - 11 years and a day to the last time that happened. With the score reading 231 for 6 at tea, South Africa were in charge but things went pear-shaped after the interval. Truly, final sessions have seldom had so much packed in them.
