Brett Lee showed some speed during his return from injury in one of the few good signs from Australia during a heavy Twenty20 loss to Pakistan. Brad Haddin, the stand-in captain, felt his side was already on the plane home following the tough one-day series, and they were dismissed for 108 before going down by seven wickets. However, Haddin was pleased with the effort of Lee, who had figures of 1 for 22 from four overs in a promising start following five months out with foot and ankle problems. "It was good to see the return of Brett Lee and if tonight's any indication of how he's going to go it looks like he is going to come back with some pretty good pace," Haddin told AAP after the match. Lee's first ball was recorded at 149kph and gained an edge from Salman Butt, but it went for four when Marcus North couldn't hold the catch in the cordon.
