Australia 377 for 6 (Hayden 101, Ponting 91, Clarke 92) beat South Africa 294 (de Villiers 92, Smith 74) by 83 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith blitzed away in the early stages, but South Africa couldn't sustain their attack ? AFP The first-round match between South Africa and Australia threatened to be a repeat of the epic at the Wanderers, but St Kitts' Warner Park is no Wanderers, and history steadfastly refused to repeat itself. Australia comfortably defended their 377 for 6, which was set up by Matthew Hayden's fastest World Cup century, and South Africa finished 83 runs adrift. Adam Gilchrist and Hayden put on a century opening stand in less than 15 overs, setting up a launching pad from which the middle-order could wade into the bowling. South Africa's innings started in a similar same way and it was AB de Villiers who ignited the run chase of 378. He stated his intentions emphatically in the first over by crashing a boundary and then following it with an audacious short-arm jab that sailed over midwicket for six.
