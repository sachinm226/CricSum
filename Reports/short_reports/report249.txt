England 281 (Root 63, Moeen 59, Bell 53, Lyon 3-36) and 124 for 2 (Bell 65*) beat Australia 136 (Rogers 52, Anderson 6-47) and 265 (Warner 77, Nevill 59, Starc 58, Finn 6-79) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia arrived on the third morning in Birmingham dreaming of a monumental comeback. They left on the third afternoon still dreaming of one. It will have to come at Trent Bridge and The Oval, though. There were no last-minute surprises at Edgbaston, where Ian Bell's second fifty of the match ensured a 2-1 series lead for England and snuffed out any hopes Australia raised during a tail-end fight that set England a target of 121. It might still have proved tricky had a few top-order wickets fallen early.
