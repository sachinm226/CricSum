Australia 250 for 7 (Hussey 65, Maxwell 56*, Ajmal 3-37) beat Pakistan 244 for 7 (Hafeez 78, Jamshed 48, Starc 4-51) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mohammad Hafeez and Nasir Jamshed added 129 at the top Associated Press A little calmer when it mattered most, Australia completed a victory more testing than the scoreboard ultimately showed to defeat Pakistan in Sharjah and claim the overnight ODI series 2-1. It was a result achieved as much by perspiration as inspiration, Michael Hussey and the nerveless tyro Glenn Maxwell forming the critical union to rescue their team from the uncertainty of 159 for 5 when Matthew Wade fell to Abdur Rehman. Michael Hussey could so easily have been out lbw to Saeed Ajmal before he had scored, amid a mesmerising spell in which the offspinner claimed what appeared a pivotal 3 for 11. But Misbah-ul-Haq made a pair of judgements that were to prove too timid - failing to refer the umpire Billy Bowden's decision, and then taking Ajmal off after five overs when another wicket or two might have sealed Australia's fate. Pakistan's hesitation could perhaps be attributed to the weight of history, having not defeated Australia in an ODI series since 2002.
