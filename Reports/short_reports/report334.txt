India 308 for 6 (Karthik 146*, Dhoni 91) beat Australia 65 (Yadav 5-18, Ishant 3-11) by 243 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Dhoni and Karthik put on 211 runs for the sixth wicket to effectively take the game away from Australia Associated Press An aggressive all-round display by India, including another match-winning century from Dinesh Karthik and a five-wicket haul from Umesh Yadav, inflicted a stinging 243-run defeat on Australia in the teams' second warm-up match. Karthik was the batting star of the match, scoring his second consecutive ton in the warm-up fixtures, strengthening his case for a place in India's starting XI in the tournament. "I think he has earned his place in the side and we'll just have to see who misses out when we play against South Africa," MS Dhoni said after the game. "I'd like him to play at the top of the order but we'll [have to wait and] see." The game was virtually over 54 minutes into the chase, when Australia were reduced to 34 for 6 in the face of some fierce fast bowling from Yadav, who picked up a five-wicket haul in his first, and only, spell of five overs.
