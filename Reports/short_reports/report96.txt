England 259 (Root 62, Tye 5-46) beat Australia 247 (Stoinis 87, Curran 5-35) by 12 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A shattering spell of reverse swing by Tom Curran foiled Australia's chase of a modest England total and in turn silenced a West Australian record crowd of 53,781 in the first ODI to be played at Perth's new stadium. A trio of players from out west - Mitchell Marsh, AJ Tye and Marcus Stoinis - had prospered earlier in the match, but it was the effervescent Curran who had the final say, years after he had been childhood friends with Marsh when growing up in Zimbabwe. Australia seemed to be travelling comfortably in pursuit of 260 for victory, after England's batsmen had squandered a series of starts, when Stoinis fell within sight of a hundred upon his promotion to No. 3 in the home side's batting order. Having earlier ended a poor series for David Warner with a lively yorker, Curran was called back by Eoin Morgan and had his second ball curling back to confound the recalled Glenn Maxwell.
