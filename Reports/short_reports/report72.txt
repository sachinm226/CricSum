Australia 285 for 7 (Finch 100, Warner 53, Woakes 2-46) beat England 221 (Stokes 89, Behrendorff 5-44, Starc 4-43) by 64 runs As it happened Australia played Test match cricket in miniature to get the better of England and a set of conditions at Lord's that were not really in the blueprint for Eoin Morgan's side ahead of a tournament in which they now face the tightest of ropes to qualify for the semi-finals. Australia, meanwhile, are now in the final four, the first team to get there. The cut and thrust of this Lord's ODI was a world away from the virtual home run derby of Trent Bridge a year ago. That day, England tallied a gargantuan 481 and seemingly set the tone for the way this World Cup would be played. Yet, in the crucible of a global tournament played in the damp of an early summer beset by rain, Australia's more deliberate plans, built on a stable, steady top order and a collective of pace and class with the ball have held up; the fireworks of Nottingham might as well have taken place on Mars.
