Australia 9 for 222 (Warner 60, Starc 52*, Kulasekara 3-30) v Sri Lanka 0 for 14 - match abandoned Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Nuwan Kulasekara again exploited the Australia line-up's uncertainty against the moving, bouncing ball Getty Images If it wasn't 74, it still wasn't pretty. Australia's batsmen were again exposed by the moving ball in the hands of Sri Lanka's seamers before the fourth ODI at the SCG was washed out. The Sri Lankan chase was at first delayed, then abandoned due to an outfield tardy in drying, after only 3.2 overs. At 0 for 14, the visitors stood a strong chance of overhauling the target and claiming the series.
