Australia 348 for 6 (Hayden 103, Ponting 66, Watson 65*) beat New Zealand 133 (Fulton 62, Hogg 4-29) by 215 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Matthew Hayden's century was the 100th hundred in World Cups and it set up a crushing win ? AFP Matthew Hayden's third hundred of the competition, the hundredth case of a century in World Cups, was at the heart of a power-packed Australian batting performance during a thumping 215-run triumph against New Zealand in Grenada. Australia, clearly the best team in the tournament, are now two steps away from claiming a hat-trick of World Cups and will travel to St Lucia to take on South Africa in the second semi-final on Wednesday. It was a dominant, almost vengeful, Australian effort, one which would have helped erase the painful memories of the 3-0 whitewash in the recent Chappell-Hadlee series. Hayden shone the brightest but Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson chipped in with valuable fifties - the first a bustling knock at the top, the second a blitzer at the end. New Zealand were without Shane Bond and Jacob Oram, who were out with injury and illness, but this turned into a nightmare of sorts, ending in their worst defeat in one-day history.
