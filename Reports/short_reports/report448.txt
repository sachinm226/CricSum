Australia 133 for 5 (Marsh 70, Prasanna 3-32) beat Sri Lanka 132 (Jayawardene 53, Lee 4-15, Doherty 4-28) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Xavier Doherty picked up a career-best 4 for 28 AFP Crisis? What crisis? To watch Australia demolish Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI in Colombo, it would be easy to believe all was well with Australian cricket. Thanks to some fine bowling from Xavier Doherty and Brett Lee, a calm innings from Shaun Marsh, and a couple of brain explosions from Sri Lanka's batsmen, Australia secured the series with a match in hand, courtesy a five-wicket win in the fourth ODI. Smart stats Australia won with 132 balls to spare, which is their second-largest ODI win in Sri Lanka in terms of balls remaining. For Sri Lanka, though, this was their largest defeat at home. Only six times have Sri Lanka been bowled out for a lower total in home ODIs.
