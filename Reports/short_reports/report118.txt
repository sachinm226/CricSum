Australians 283 for 6 (Head 106, Finch 54, Barber 3-62) beat Middlesex 182 (Holden 71, K Richardson 3-31) by 101 runs Scorecard Glenn Maxwell could face a nervous wait to see whether there is a place for him at the start of the one-day series against England after his second failure in three days. He was the only one of the Australians' top order not to make a start against Middlesex at Lord's as Travis Head's century anchored the innings before the home side's chase faded away. Maxwell was lbw sweeping at left-arm spinner Ravi Patel as Middlesex's trio of spinners did an excellent job - none more so than 20-year-old Max Holden who bowled his 10 overs for 29 - in throttling the Australians' innings in a similar manner to how Sussex fought back a couple of days ago. On that occasion, Maxwell drove the part-time legspin of Luke Wells to mid-off for 1 and his lack of runs in England follow on from a lean IPL. The Australians shuffled their batting order for this outing with Head promoted to open - back to the position where he finished the previous series against England - Aaron Finch slipping down to the middle and Shaun Marsh replacing Marcus Stoinis at No.
