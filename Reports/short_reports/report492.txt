Australia 248 for 4 (Haddin 110, Ponting 69) beat New Zealand 245 (Taylor 62, Johnson 3-41, Harris 3-48) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brad Haddin's best ODI score buried New Zealand Getty Images Brad Haddin's second one-day international century gave Australia a 2-1 lead and the most one-sided victory of the tour, as they chased down their target with 16 balls to spare. Haddin's 110 was his highest ODI score and he ended Daniel Vettori's hopes of winning what he said before the match was "the most important game of the series". Ricky Ponting was annoyed in the opening two games at his batsmen's inability to capitalise on their starts, and they resolved that problem at Seddon Park. Ponting made 69 and combined with Haddin for a matchwinning 151-run partnership that justified Ponting's rare decision to send New Zealand in. It is a gamble he has taken 24 times in his ODI captaincy career for a remarkable 20 victories.
