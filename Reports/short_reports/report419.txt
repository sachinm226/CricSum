South Africa 225 (du Plessis 78*) and 569 (Amla 196, de Villiers 169, Smith 84, Starc 6-154) beat Australia 163 (Wade 68, Steyn 4-40) and 322 (Starc 68*, Cowan 53, Steyn 3-72, Peterson 3-127) by 309 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A 309-run victory underlined South Africa's status as the world's best side Associated Press To crib a line from E.T.'s Elliot, this is reality.
