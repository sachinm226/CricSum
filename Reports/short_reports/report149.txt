Australia 9 for 268 (Wade 100*, Maxwell 60, Hasan Ali 3-65) beat Pakistan 176 (Faulkner 4-32, Cummins 3-33) by 92 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Matthew Wade performed a commendable salvage operation for Australia to put up a total that proved well beyond the reach of Pakistan in the first ODI at an enervating Gabba. Defeat may be particularly ruinous for the visitors given an apparent hamstring tear to the captain Azhar Ali, who must now be in grave doubt for the rest of the tour. Azhar suffered the injury early in Pakistan's ultimately doomed pursuit, and did it no favours when coming back out to bat at the fall of the sixth wicket. Brisbane's hot and humid weather also claimed an Australian casualty, with the debutant Billy Stanlake appearing in some distress and unable to add to his initial three overs. Fortunately for Australia's captain Steven Smith, he had plenty of other bowling options to call upon, including the exceptionally-tidy Travis Head.
