Australia 229 for 2 (Finch 172, Short 46) beat Zimbabwe 129 for 9 (Tye 3-12, Agar 2-16) by 100 runs Rather than throw a kettle over a pub, it was Zimbabwe pasted all over the Harare Sports Club. Aaron Finch bludgeoned his way to within three runs of Chris Gayle's world-record Twenty20 score and bettered his own chart-topper in Twenty20 internationals as Australia cantered to a second victory in as many days in the triangular series in Harare. Placing his stamp on the tournament and Australia's short-form captaincy, Finch blazed 10 sixes in an opening stand of 223 - with a more subdued D'Arcy Short - that lasted until the final over of the visitors' innings after they were sent in by Zimbabwe. Left with three balls to make the four runs he required to set a new world record score in all T20 matches, Finch was dismissed hit wicket when aiming for one more mighty blow. Still, he walked off having delivered a comfortably match-winning total for his team.
