Australia 7 for 520 dec & 150 beat West Indies 312 and 323 (Deonarine 82, Nash 65) by 35 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Doug Bollinger finished off the match with the wicket - and debatable edge - of Kemar Roach, giving him eight for the game Getty Images Australia needed 21 balls on the last day to win the final Test and take the Frank Worrell Trophy with a 2-0 victory over West Indies. The result was virtually assured as soon as the day broke sunny, with the hosts wanting one wicket and it came when Kemar Roach was ruled caught behind via an umpiring review. Roach and Gavin Tonge had added 15 when Doug Bollinger and the Australians were certain Roach had got an edge to Brad Haddin. The batsman immediately called for a review: there was a noise but no replay showed a clear nick and there was nothing on Hot Spot. Everyone was standing around for a couple of minutes before Billy Bowden finally raised his finger for a second time following consultation with Asad Rauf.
