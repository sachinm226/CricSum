Australia 158 for 3 (Finch 71, Warner 48) beat Bangladesh 153 for 5 (Shakib 66, Mushfiqur 47) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Al-Amin Hossain fined Bangladesh fast bowler Al-Amin Hossain was fined 15% of his match fee, for giving David Warner a send-off after dismissing him. He was found to be in breach of article 2.1.4 of the ICC code of conduct, which relates to "using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting during an international match". If the destructive power brought to bear by Aaron Finch and David Warner allowed Australia to evade the ignominy of their worst-ever global tournament display, then it also underlined why the sometime favourites will fly home with an especially bitter memory of the 2014 World Twenty20.
