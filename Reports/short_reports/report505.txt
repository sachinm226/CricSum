England 214 for 9 (Strauss 87, Bollinger 3-20, Tait 3-28) beat Australia 212 (Watson 61, Swann 4-37, Anderson 3-22) by one wicket Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Tim Bresnan kept his cool to deliver a series win for England AFP The finale was clumsy and ungainly, and it came as scant consolation for the wider sporting public on a day when the nation's footballers were soundly thrashed by their own arch-enemies, Germany, but England's cricketers somehow held their nerve to wrap up an unassailable 3-0 lead with two matches to come in their ODI series against Australia. After Graeme Swann's 4 for 37 had limited the Aussies to an eminently gettable 212, England had at one stage been coasting to victory on 185 for 3 with eight-and-a-half overs in hand, but a sensational collapse of six wickets for 18 in 38 balls meant their victory bunting had been somewhat frayed around the edges by the time Tim Bresnan slashed two desperate boundaries in the space of three deliveries to seal a one-wicket victory with five balls to spare. The catalyst for the collapse was the dismissal of Eoin Morgan, England's star finisher from the first two games at the Rose Bowl and Cardiff. He had joined forces with his captain, Andrew Strauss, to take England to the brink of a thumping victory when he swatted a tame pull to midwicket off Steven Smith to give Australia a sniff of an opening. Seven balls later, and with his fourth ODI century there for the taking, Strauss edged Ryan Harris with 24 still needed from 44 balls, whereupon Luke Wright hoisted Smith to long-off for a third-ball duck.
