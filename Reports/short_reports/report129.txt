Pakistan 282 (Fakhar 94, Sarfraz 94, Lyon 4-78) and 400 for 9 dec (Babar 99, Sarfraz 81, Fakhar 66, Azhar 64) beat Australia 145 (Finch 39, Abbas 5-33) and 164 (Labuschagne 43, Abbas 5-62) by 373 runs 0:50 Mohammad Abbas, Pakistan's second-fastest to 50 Test wickets Abu Dhabi really was nothing like Dubai. Over in the nation's most global city, Australia batted out 140 overs in blazing sunshine to thwart Pakistan's hopes of a win. Here in the capital under clouds and a slight drizzle, it took Mohammad Abbas and his teammates barely 50 overs to scythe through an Australian side that looked as feeble as the worst pessimist had feared a fortnight ago. Abbas completed a five-wicket haul, his second in this match and his fourth in a career that yet spans a mere 10 matches. It was his scintillating spell on Friday morning that ripped through Australia's middle order, condemning them to a 373-run defeat, their fourth-worst in history.
