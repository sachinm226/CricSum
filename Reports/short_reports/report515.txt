Marker of the day Everything about this series has been viewed through an Ashes-shaped prism. At Cardiff England were delighted when their short-ball plan worked against Michael Clarke, and here a similar method proved successful against Ricky Ponting. Australia's captain has had problems against the short ball in recent times - stemming from a tasty head-to-head with Kemar Roach - and on this occasion he got into an awful tangle against Broad's bouncer and gloved a catch to Craig Kieswetter. Both sides will store that memory away for Brisbane. Timely wicket of the day Tim Paine has struggled for fluency throughout the series and it came to a head at Lord's with a laborious 90-ball 54.
