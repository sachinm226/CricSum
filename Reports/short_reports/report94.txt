Australia 467 (Head 114, Smith 85, Paine 79, Labuschagne 63, Wagner 4-83) and 5 for 168 dec beat New Zealand 148 and 240 (Blundell 121, Lyon 4-81, Pattinson 3-35) by 247 runs James Pattinson and Nathan Lyon combined to bowl Australia to a handsome 247-run victory with a day to spare, and with it retention of the Trans-Tasman trophy, but makeshift opener Tom Blundell showed tremendous spirit with a second Test hundred to take it deep into the final session. Pattinson's three-wicket pre-lunch burst appeared to be hurtling New Zealand to a swift defeat, but Blundell stood up magnificently to the challenge. However, Lyon's 4 for 81 ensured Australia would not have to return on Monday to wrap things up. After being set a hypothetical 488 for victory - following Australia's declaration 10 overs into the day - New Zealand plummeted to 3 for 35 as Pattinson claimed three wickets in nine balls which included losing Kane Williamson for a duck. Blundell, who had never opened in first-class cricket before this match, could have been lbw in the first over but went on to play an outstanding innings and score the first century by a New Zealander at the MCG.
