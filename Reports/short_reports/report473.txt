Australia 6 for 286 (Marsh 83, Clarke 80, Hussey 49) beat Pakistan 246 (Umar Akmal 59, Harris 5-43, McKay 3-48) by 40 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ryan Harris was the star for Australia with five wickets in his second ODI Getty Images In his second one-day international, Ryan Harris kept a cool head under pressure to deliver Australia a 40-run victory and an unassailable 3-0 series lead after Shahid Afridi lit up a match that had threatened to fizzle out. Workmanlike half-centuries from Shaun Marsh and Michael Clarke, and a late Michael Hussey blitz, set up Australia's 6 for 286 before Harris grabbed 5 for 43 to confirm Australia's win. It was a remarkable effort from Harris, who finished up as the Man of the Match having only been called into the squad late on match eve as cover for Peter Siddle, who had a sore back. He began with a wicket in his first over and returned with three in two overs during the batting Powerplay when Afridi and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan were giving Pakistan hope of a famous fightback. They had taken 37 from the first three overs of the field restrictions.
