Australia 294 for 9 (Maxwell 77, Marsh 73, Wood 3-54) beat England 275 for 9 (Billings 118, Bairstow 84, Hazlewood 3-26) by 19 runs Australia began their World Cup Super League campaign with a hard-fought victory over the world champions at Emirates Old Trafford. A century stand between Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh helped salvage a stuttering effort with the bat, and the bowlers then closed the door on England despite a characterful maiden international hundred from Sam Billings. Australia's efforts with the ball were exemplified by Josh Hazlewood, whose spotless 3 for 26 helped keep England just beyond social distance. Hazlewood's first wicket came via an instinctive one-handed catch in his follow through, and he later contributed to the removal of Jonny Bairstow, for 84, with a diving take at long-on. Such excellence in the field, maintained until the final ball when Billings was held by David Warner running in from long-on, only served to steepen England's climb.
