Australia 129 for 4 (Finch 39, Tahir 2-21) beat South Africa 128 for 7 (De Kock 41, Starc 2-16) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia's bowlers set up the win with Mitchell Starc leading the way AFP Australia ended their South African tour as they started it: with an emphatic win in Centurion. They overwhelmed the hosts in the longest and shortest format at the venue to claim both trophies on offer in their month-long visit and winning the T20 series by a 2-0 margin. In conditions that offered swing and seam movement, Australia's bowlers restricted South Africa to a below-par total. Their batsmen, sans David Warner who was rested for the final game, chased it down like a team in a hurry and they are - to get to the World T20 in Bangladesh. Australia will go there far more prepared than South Africa after a clinical performance that exposed South Africa's vulnerabilities, especially without their two pace spearheads.
