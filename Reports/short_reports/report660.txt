Match abandoned due to rain New Zealand 3 for 30 (Styris 12*, Lee 2-12) v Australia Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brett Lee struck when he removed Lou Vincent in the first over and further success followed before rain stopped play ? Getty Images Rain ended Australia's hopes of regaining the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy within three days as only six overs were possible in the second ODI at the SCG. Australia were well on top when the weather turned bad, reducing New Zealand to 3 for 30 after Daniel Vettori chose to bat. The umpires called for the covers at 3.30pm local time, just 30 minutes after the start, which had also been delayed due to drizzle. As the day progressed the weather radar continued to display a bleak outlook and only the most optimistic spectators stayed at the ground.
