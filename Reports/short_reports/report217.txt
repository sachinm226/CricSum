South Africa 327 for 8 (Rossouw 122, Duminy 73, Mennie 3-49) beat Australia 296 (Warner 173, Tahir 2-42, Abbott 2-48) by 31 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:59 By the Numbers - Australia suffer rare whitewash South Africa inflicted a first-ever five-match ODI series whitewash on Australia with a tense victory that underlined the main difference between the two sides. Not only was Australia's inexperienced attack unable to challenge South Africa's batsmen, but their batting line-up, bar David Warner, could not keep up either. Warner scored his second century of the series and was Australia's only real hope of pulling off the highest successful chase at Newlands to take home a consolation win after Rilee Rossouw's third ODI century - a 118-ball 122 - propelled South Africa to 327 for 8. Warner's 173 was six short of a career-best, but could have ended on 11 when he edged Kagiso Rabada to slip. Quinton de Kock dived in front of Hashim Amla and spilled the chance.
