India 252 (Kohli 92, Rahane 55, Coulter-Nile 3-51, Richardson 3-55) beat Australia 202 (Stoinis 62*, Smith 59, Bhuvneshwar 3-9, Kuldeep 3-54) by 50 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details New-ball swing; awkward, hit-the-deck seam; a pair of wristspinners turning their stock ball in opposite directions; a hustling, bustling, bouncer-happy allrounder. Seldom has an Indian ODI attack contained this much variety. Seldom has it all come together so spectacularly. During the innings break, India may have felt they could defend 252 on an Eden Gardens pitch that had been a little two-paced through their innings. They may have expected even more help for their bowlers under lights - it was one of the reasons Virat Kohli had cited for choosing to bat first.
