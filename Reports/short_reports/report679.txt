Australia 322 for 6 (Hayden 158) beat West Indies 219 (Lara 77) by 103 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Shaun Tait added two wickets as Australia's march continued ? AFP West Indies, who fancy their chances to be the first host team to win a World Cup, suffered their opening loss of the tournament, a thumping one at that, against a rampant Australia that is slowly building up ominous momentum. Matthew Hayden set the game up with an innings of tremendous control and power on a first day cut in half by rain, and the bowlers backed it up with a cool performance on the second. Chasing 323 against Australia's varied attack is a tough ask at the best of times. Fortunately for the West Indians, the dampness caused by the overnight drizzle at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua did nothing to cause exaggerated assistance for the fast bowlers early on. Nathan Bracken was steady, moving the ball a touch, but the approach of West Indies' openers was strange.
