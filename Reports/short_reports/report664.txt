Australia 1 for 111 (Ponting 51*) beat England 110 (Bell 35, Johnson 4-45, Lee 2-8) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball commentary Adam Gilchrist was Australia's only casualty in the comfortable chase ? Getty Images England have spluttered to so many deflating losses on this tour that even rabid and patriotic Australian supporters have started pleading for them to lift off the bottom. After today's nine-wicket caning in a match lasting only 59 overs the same thought stands. Please can this be the turning point? There is still time for England repairs - the CB Series has just passed the halfway point and, amazingly, they could reach the finals easily - but on this performance they would have been lucky to have achieved anything positive in the World Cup warm-up for the minnows in Kenya. Throughout the tour Andrew Flintoff has spoken proudly about the strong spirit in the dressing room, but his men have been unable to transform the talk and have slumped horribly since a brief change of direction against New Zealand in Hobart. For some reason Adelaide, the most beautiful of grounds, turns England into their ugliest.
