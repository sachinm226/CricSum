Australia 231 for 9 (Paine 81, K O'Brien 3-43) beat Ireland 192 (Porterfield 39, Hopes 5-14) by 39 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Nathan Hauritz took two important wickets as Australia overcame Ireland in Dublin AFP Australia almost became the joke of the day in Dublin before James Hopes' five wickets ensured a seriously rusty performance ended in a 39-run success over Ireland. It was an ODI that was meant to be a warm-up for Ricky Ponting's side, but it was rightly treated as a full-scale international by Ireland and the highly-fancied visitors were almost embarrassed. The captain William Porterfield started the dramatic chase of Australia's 232 by blasting three fours off Ryan Harris' first over and he later pulled a six off Clint McKay during a frenetic 80-run opening partnership with Paul Stirling. It felt like a Twenty20 game but eventually turned into a more familiar exchange between the world's No.1-ranked team and one of the minnows.
