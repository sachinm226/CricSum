West Indies 160 (Smith 63, Lee 3-23) beat Australia 146 for 9 (Warner 58, Samuels 3-23, Edwards 3-23) by 14 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Dwayne Smith top scored for West Indies with 63 AFP Fidel Edwards and Marlon Samuels bowled West Indies to a 14-run victory to draw the Twenty20 series 1-1 in Barbados. Dwayne Smith and Johnson Charles started the day with a strong, aggressive opening partnership and despite Australia's bowlers fighting back to dismiss West Indies for 160, it proved to be sufficient for the hosts as Australia's batsmen stalled in the chase after David Warner's quick opening. Too much was left for the final few overs for Australia, who needed 50 from the last five overs and then 19 from the last six balls, bowled by Dwayne Bravo. David Hussey was the only specialist batsmen left at the crease but he couldn't launch the boundaries required off Bravo, who picked up two wickets in that final over as Australia fell well short of their target. Hussey was caught at deep midwicket for 19 trying to clear the boundary and Clint McKay was bowled next ball by Bravo, who finished with 2 for 27 from his four overs and changed the course of the match by running out Warner with a direct hit from side-on.
