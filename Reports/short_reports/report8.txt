Australia 252 for 9 (Carey 67, Turner 49, Walsh Jr 5-39) beat West Indies 123 (Pollard 56, Starc 5-48, Hazlewood 3-11) by 133 runs (DLS method) Mitchell Starc took a five-wicket haul as he and Josh Hazlewood dismantled West Indies in the opening ODI to give Alex Carey, who had earlier played a key hand with the bat, a winning start as Australia's ODI captain. Carey, standing in for the injured Aaron Finch, had formed the backbone of Australia's innings with Ashton Turner in a fifth-wicket stand of 104 in 19 overs before Hayden Walsh Jr sparked a late collapse with a career-best five-wicket haul. However, Australia's 252 - which was adjusted to a target of 257 after three rain interruptions cut the match to 49 overs - quickly looked imposing as Starc and Hazlewood got to work with the new ball to leave West Indies in a heap at 27 for 6. Starc took three wickets in his first spell and then returned to end the aggressive rearguard of Kieron Pollard. Pollard hit a 41-ball fifty, but the West Indies captain had been left with far too much ground to regain.
