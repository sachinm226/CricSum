Australia 323 all out (Head 84, Labuschagne 81, Lakmal 5-75) beat Sri Lanka 144 and 139 all out (Thirimanne 32, Cummins 6-23) by an innings and 40 runs Sri Lanka's batting failed abysmally for the second time in the match, as they crashed to 139 all out, to lose the first Test against Australia in roughly two-and-a-half days. It was the quick and intense Pat Cummins who precipitated Sri Lanka's collapse, and Cummins who made the greatest impact for Australia through the match. His 6 for 23 in the second innings are his best innings figures, and his 10 for 62 in the match is also a career-best. So outstanding was he late on day two and in day three, that Sri Lanka did not muster a single boundary off his 15 overs, in the second innings. He also essentially sealed the match by removing Sri Lanka's three key batsmen.
