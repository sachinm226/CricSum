Australia 295 (Haddin 94, Johnson 64, Broad 6-81) and 7 for 401 dec (Warner 124, Clarke 113, Haddin 53) beat England 136 (Johnson 4-61, Harris 3-28) and 173 (Cook 65, Johnson 5-42) by 381 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 24:58 The field set for Mitchell Johnson summed up Australia's supremacy as they closed in on victory in the first Test at the Gabba. Every fielder was there for the kill: four slips, a fly slip, two leg slips, silly mid off, short leg. Australia were all over England - or at least Johnson was - and after tea it briefly felt like the 1970s again with Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in their pomp. Australia needed this win badly. They had not won a Test in 10 attempts and an Ashes Test in eight goes.
