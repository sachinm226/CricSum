Australia 3 for 265 (Smith 108*, Handscomb 82) beat Pakistan 7 for 263 (Azam 84, Sharjeel 50, Hazlewood 3-32) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details "We've traditionally chased pretty well here at the WACA," Steven Smith said after sending Pakistan in to bat. Perhaps what he meant was that he chases pretty well at the WACA. Last summer, Smith plundered 149 as Australia hunted down a target of 310 against India, winning in the last over. This time it was easier - Australia passed Pakistan's 263 with five overs left - but again a Smith hundred got them there. Smith finished unbeaten on 108, his eighth ODI century, as Australia took a 2-1 lead in the series.
