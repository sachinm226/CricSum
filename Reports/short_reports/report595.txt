Australia 5 for 198 (M Hussey 57*) beat Bangladesh 125 (Tamim 63, Hopes 3-30) by 73 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Michael Hussey, the Player of the Series, registered an important half-century that kept Australia ahead of the committed tourists ? AFP Tamim Iqbal's one-man entertainment show was not enough to turn Darwin into Cardiff as Australia wrapped up a 3-0 cleansweep with a 73-run victory over Bangladesh. Tamim mastered the slow surface better than anyone had all week. He showed more flair than Australia's key man Michael Hussey but only two of Tamim's colleagues reached double figures and three wickets to James Hopes led to a familiar result. Bangladesh were chasing 199, which despite their batting woes on this tour looked like a vaguely feasible target. When Tamim lashed the likes of Hopes and Mitchell Johnson there were some nervous flutters from Michael Clarke, who was part of the team when Bangladesh upset Australia in Cardiff in 2005.
