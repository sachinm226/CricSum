Pakistan 155 for 8 (Babar 68*, Hafeez 39, Stanlake 3-21, Tye 3-24) beat Australia 89 (Coulter-Nile 34, Imad 3-20, Ashraf 2-10) by 66 runs At the trophy unveiling on Tuesday, Aaron Finch and Sarfraz Ahmed stood together, posing for the pre-series picture with the silverware the two teams would fight for. That it was called the TUC Cup for sponsorship reasons was unsurprising in today's age, but when you looked closely, you saw the Cup was rather aptly named. Perched on top of a set of three stumps and a cricket ball was a monstrously large TUC biscuit. That word is used advisedly. The trophy might have looked horrendous if it wasn't comical.
