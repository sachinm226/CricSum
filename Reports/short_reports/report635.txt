Australia 92 for 1 (Gilchrist 34, Hussey 30*) beat Ireland 91 (McGrath 3-17, Tait 3-39) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out - Ireland How they were out - Australia Shaun Tait blew through Ireland's top order with three wickets ? Getty Images With the ruthlessness that everyone has come to expect from the Australians, they overwhelmed Ireland by nine wickets at Bridgetown after demolishing them for 91. The pace and bounce of Glenn McGrath and Shaun Tait proved too much for the Irish top order, as they removed the top four inside five overs, and only three batsmen reached double figures. The result confirms Australia as the first team in the semi-finals. Australia could have decided to use this match to hone their all-round game: have a bat, rack up 300-plus then bowl when the track was slower. But they are a team with one focus: winning as quickly and effectively as possible.
