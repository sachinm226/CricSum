India 202 for 4 (Yuvraj 77*) beat Australia 201 for 7 (Finch 89, Vinay 3-26) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Yuvraj Singh hunted down the target of 202 with the calm of old BCCI 4:05 Aakash Chopra: 'Yuvraj, the perennial comeback man' In his second comeback after recovering from cancer, a leaner and fitter Yuvraj Singh was called upon to do a job he has done numerous times for India in ODIs - revive a floundering chase, with MS Dhoni for company, and only the lower order to follow. Only, this was a T20 and Yuvraj did not have the luxury of building his innings before accelerating. He duly cut out the building part, and unleashed trademark pick-up sixes and lofted drives to haul in the target of 202 with two deliveries remaining. India were facing an asking-rate of nearly 12 at 100 for 4 in the 12th over, but Yuvraj's response was so forceful, that all Dhoni needed to do was give him the strike. By the end, the partnership was 102 at exactly two runs a ball, Yuvraj's 77 off 35 showing his dominance.
