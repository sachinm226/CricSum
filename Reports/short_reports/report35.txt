South Africa 158 for 4 (de Kock 70, Richardson 2-21) beat Australia 146 for 6 (Warner 67*, Ngidi 3-41) by 12 runs South African cricket enjoyed its best day of the summer as both the men's and women's teams won in the final over of their respective T20s to secure results of great significance. The women beat England in the opening match of their T20 World Cup campaign, while the men stayed alive in the three-match rubber against Australia with a series-levelling victory in Port Elizabeth. South Africa defended a requirement of 25 runs off the last three overs on a subcontinental-like surface, where run-scoring slowed down in the second half of both teams' innings. The victory will come as a major morale booster for a South Africa side that have not won a trophy this season but remain in the hunt to change that in the coming week. The decider will be played on Wednesday in Cape Town, the scene of the start of Quinton de Kock's takeover as permanent white-ball captain.
