England 243 for 6 (Morgan 52, Strauss 51, Bollinger 3-46) beat Australia 239 for 7 (White 86*, Watson 57, Broad 4-44) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Stuart Broad picked up four wickets and Australia struggled to recover from his early strikes PA Photos There was no Eoin Morgan-like standout this time, but England still cruised to a comfortable four-wicket win to take a 2-0 lead in the series. From Stuart Broad's three early wickets to an impressive Andrew Strauss half-century, to a coasting partnership from Paul Collingwood and Morgan to confirm the result, it was a thoroughly professional victory for the hosts. On a day when Australia installed a Labor prime minister born in Wales, the nation's cricketers laboured in Wales for no such reward. Cameron White ground out one of his least attractive half-centuries to drive Australia to 239 for 7 but that was never going to be enough on a surface that, while a little slow, was no minefield. The Australian batsmen struggled to time the ball and their innings was full of thick edges and jarring woody clunks.
