Matthew Wade started it out of form but in the side. Together, they set up a series victory by plotting one of Australia's most remarkable one-day international chases, in front of one of the MCG's most remarkably small international crowds. Smith's 104 was reminiscent of Michael Bevan's heroics at the SCG on New Year's Day 1996, delivering victory from a position where defeat seemed inevitable. Smith and Wade came together with Australia's score at 5 for 98 in pursuit of 268.
