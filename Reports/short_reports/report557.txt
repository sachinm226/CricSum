20 overs Australia 219 for 6 (Watson 52, Haddin 47, Mahmudullah 4-37) beat Bangladesh 181 for 7 (Shakib 54, Johnson 3-21) by 38 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Mohammad Ashraful lost his off stump to Mitchell Johnson, Australia's best bowler Getty Images Australia, spurred to a daunting total by a thumping opening partnership from Brad Haddin and Shane Watson, clinched a facile victory over Bangladesh in Nottingham. From the start it was apparent that Australia were going to dominate, what with Bangladesh's medium-pacers leaking runs and Tamim Iqbal reprieving Haddin in the first over. Haddin and Watson - who slammed a 21-ball half-century - made Bangladesh pay and though Mahmudullah's four wickets ensured Australia didn't post an even more mammoth total, the favourites clearly had enough runs. Bangladesh's top order chased hard, but following Shakib Al Hasan's dismissal for a sprightly 54 in the 14th over the wheels fell off. Australia's openers effectively nailed the match in eight overs.
