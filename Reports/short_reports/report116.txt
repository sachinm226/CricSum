England 342 for 8 (Roy 120, Buttler 91*) beat Australia 304 (Marsh 131, Plunkett 4-53) by 38 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England's cricketers inflicted the final blow of a miserable day for Australian sport by taking a 38-run victory - and a two-nil series lead - in the Royal London ODI in Cardiff. On a day that had already seen Australia's male international teams lose to France (in the football World Cup) and Ireland (in a rugby union international), England registered the highest score they had ever made against Australia in ODI cricket and the highest score made in an ODI in Cardiff. It was enough to see Australia's cricketers suffer the same fate as their compatriots and means that England have now won seven of the last eight ODIs between these sides. It makes Scotland's success over England in Edinburgh a week ago seem ever more impressive. The result was a cruel return for Shaun Marsh after a hugely impressive innings.
