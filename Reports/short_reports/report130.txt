Pakistan 482 (Hafeez 126, Sohail 110, Siddle 3-58, Lyon 2-114) and 181 for 6 dec (Imam 48, Shafiq 41, Holland 3-83, Lyon 2-58) drew with Australia 202 (Khawaja 85, Finch 62, Bilal 6-36, Abbas 4-29) and 362 for 8 (Khawaja 141, Head 72, Paine 61*, Yasir 4-114, Abbas 3-56) Never mind the last over. This was never meant to go to the last session, with Pakistan having left 140 overs for themselves to bowl Australia out. But Australia, spearheaded by a superhuman effort from Usman Khawaja, who batted for 302 balls, and captain Tim Paine at the end, kept Pakistan out, ensuring a draw that simply wasn't an option for much of this match. It required Nathan Lyon batting with his captain for the last 11 overs, when it looked like the visitors would succumb after Khawaja had been dismissed, but Paine and Lyon rallied. As Pakistan prowled, Paine dug deep.
