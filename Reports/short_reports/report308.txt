Australia 3 for 102 (Finch 44*, Parnell 2-17) beat South Africa 7 for 101 (Duminy 49, Faulkner 3-25, Boyce 2-15) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia cruised to one of their most comprehensive Twenty20 wins and kept the series alive after their bowlers restricted South Africa to 7 for 101 at the MCG. Cameron Boyce, Pat Cummins and James Faulkner were all key members of the attack and left little work for the batsmen, who cruised past their target for the loss of only three wickets, with 44 balls remaining. A slightly disappointing crowd of 21,415 saw their fellow Victorian Aaron Finch register his first home victory as the national T20 captain as he steered the chase with an unbeaten 44 from 30 deliveries. Ben Dunk was promoted to open with Finch and moved to 23 from 20 balls before he was caught at mid-on off Wayne Parnell, who also picked up the wicket of Shane Watson for 30. Watson crunched four boundaries off one Ryan McLaren over and gave the fans some entertainment before he was caught trying to launch Parnell over mid-off with 10 runs needed.
