New Zealand 142 for 8 (Guptill 39, Elliott 27, Faulkner 2-18) beat Australia 134 for 9 (Khawaja 38, Marsh 24, McClenaghan 3-17) by eight runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details New Zealand's Midas touch at this World Twenty20 continued in Dharamsala, where they took their tournament record to two wins from two matches with an eight-run victory over Australia. Having spun India out in Nagpur, New Zealand made one change to their side, bringing in the fast bowler Mitchell McClenaghan to replace the spinner Nathan McCullum. McClenaghan duly took 3 for 17 and played a significant role in derailing Australia's innings. Australia, by comparison, seemed confused at the selection table. They picked two specialist spinners to complement allrounder Glenn Maxwell but those two men - Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa - bowled only one over each.
