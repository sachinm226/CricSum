Australia 8 for 538 dec (Renshaw 184, Warner 113, Handscomb 110, Wahab 3-89) and 2 for 241 dec (Khawaja 79*, Smith 59, Warner 55) beat Pakistan 315 (Younis 175*, Azhar 71, Hazlewood 4-55) and 244 (Sarfraz 72*, Hazlewood 3-29, O'Keefe 3-53) by 220 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For Australia, a quadruple triple. For Pakistan, a wretched dozen. Steven Smith's men completed another crushing victory over the crestfallen visitors on a balmy day at the SCG, making it 12 consecutive wins for the Australians in home Tests against Pakistani touring teams - four clean sweeps in a row dating back to 1999. There never seemed much doubt over the result when the final day began, and even less when Josh Hazlewood struck twice in the first half hour to maintain his outstanding record this summer. From there Nathan Lyon and Steve O'Keefe worked their way through the Pakistan line-up, with Hazlewood returning to claim the final wicket on the stroke of the tea break.
