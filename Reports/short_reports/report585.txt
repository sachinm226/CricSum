Australians 337 for 6 (Watson 95, D Hussey 55, Clarke 53, M Hussey 50) beat Vice-Chancellors XI 126 (Ramdin 43) by 211 runs Scorecard Shane Watson's 95 helped the Australians toward 337 ? Getty Images Shane Watson belted 95 from 85 balls to push his case for an opening slot in the ODI series as the Australians comfortably outclassed the University of West Indies Vice-Chancellor's XI at the Three Ws Oval. Australia triumphed by 211 runs in the day-night encounter, which was also notable for Nathan Bracken's three-wicket return in his first match for Australia since having knee surgery in March. After the stand-in captain Michael Clarke chose to bat, Shaun Marsh and Watson began proceedings aggressively, but Marsh could not build on his good start, falling for 38 off Darren Sammy. Michael Hussey was the next man in, and he blitzed exactly 50 and added 103 with Watson. Watson increased his boundary count to six fours and four sixes, but fell short of a hundred when Kavesh Kantasingh, the left-arm spinner, hung on to an outstanding caught-and-bowled chance.
