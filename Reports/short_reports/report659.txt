Australia 6 for 282 (Ponting 134*, Symonds 52) beat New Zealand 168 (Styris 75) by 114 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ricky Ponting was forced to change his pace throughout his fine home-ground century, which put Australia on track for a commanding success ? Getty Images Ricky Ponting wanted to regain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy more than any of his team-mates and his determination translated into consecutive centuries as he commandeered a dominant 2-0 series win. Ponting was resting when New Zealand whitewashed Australia in February and his mission of revenge was completed after his 134 not out set up a 114-run victory in Hobart. His 107 had done a similar job in securing the opening win in Adelaide, but the home team had some tense moments at Bellerive Oval before Ponting arrived to overcome a deceptive pitch. Australia, who had rested Adam Gilchrist, fell to 3 for 87 after being sent in and needed rescuing by Ponting, who steadied and then accelerated on the way to a rewarding total of 6 for 282. It was far too much for New Zealand, who lost both openers by the fifth over and had half their order gone by 72.
