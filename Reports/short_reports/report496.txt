Zimbabwe 173 for 7 (Chigumbura 76, Johnson 4-23) beat Australia 172 for 7 (Clarke 49) by 1 run Scorecard Elton Chigumbura's frenetic innings lifted Zimbabwe to 173 Getty Images Zimbabwe delivered Australia a wake-up call after taking two wickets in the final over to seal a one-run win in their warm-up in St Lucia. Australia were on track chasing Zimbabwe's 173 for 7 when David Warner smashed 72 off 49 and the captain Michael Clarke took them to the verge of victory with 49 from 42. Australia wanted 13 from the final over but the task became too difficult when Clarke was bowled from the second-last ball by Chris Mpofu. Mitchell Johnson was then run-out from a wide and Brett Lee could only manage a bye from the final delivery. It was a practice game but it was Australia's first T20 defeat of the season and it will worry them that they lost so much momentum at the vital stages of the chase.
