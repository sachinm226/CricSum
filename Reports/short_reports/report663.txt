Australia 5 for 343 (Hayden 117, Ponting 111) beat New Zealand 5 for 335 (Oram 101*, Vincent 66) by 8 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball commentary Lou Vincent drives on the way to a 66 that gave New Zealand a base for a serious assault on the target ? Getty Images Jacob Oram gave Australia some serious jitters but they successfully defended their huge 5 for 343 that was set up by punishing Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting centuries. Twice in the past 13 months Australia lost games after scoring more than 330, but despite Oram's brilliant unbeaten century, which was interrupted by a half-hour rain delay with eight overs left, they recorded an eight-run success. Oram smashed six sixes in a 71-ball hundred, the fastest by a New Zealander, and he combined with Brendon McCullum in a 137-run stand at more than a run-and-a-half a ball. While they were always behind, the batsmen produced enough fireworks to spark a batch of local nerves. When Lou Vincent and Craig McMillan fell within eight runs of each other near the middle of the innings the target was quickly becoming out of reach, but Oram refused to believe it was over.
