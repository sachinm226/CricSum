Australia 305 for 6 (Wade 71*, Warner 59, Rashid 4-59) beat England 246 (Roy 67, Coulter-Nile 2-39, Watson 2-39) by 59 runs Scorecard A seventh-wicket partnership of 112 in 13 overs between Matthew Wade and Mitchell Marsh proved the difference between the sides in the first ODI of the series between England and Australia in Southampton. When the pair came together Australia were precariously placed on 193 for 6 and had just lost three wickets for 15 runs. But Wade, timing the ball as well as anyone, produced his highest ODI score since August 2012 - and his highest ever against a Full Member nation - as Australia added 93 from the final 10 overs. That took Australia's total above 300 and, while the game has changed up to a point, the fact remains that England have only three times successfully chased a target of that magnitude. Only once have they successfully chased a target higher than the one they were set here.
