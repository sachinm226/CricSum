India 7 for 622 dec (Pujara 193, Pant 159*, Lyon 4-178) drew with Australia 300 (Harris 79, Kuldeep 5-99) and 0 for 6 Seventy-one years after they first toured Australia, India finally have a series win to show. While it wasn't quite the grandstand 3-1 finish they would have envisaged, it was a series win well deserved as they became the first Asian side to win a Test series in Australia. History was celebrated with handshakes at little after 2.30pm on a bleak day where play didn't look possible at any stage. This meant they weren't able to add to the four overs out of the potential 155 they had at Australia to try to get the ten remaining wickets to secure a third win, after enforcing the follow-on with a 322-run lead that was achieved early on the fourth day.
