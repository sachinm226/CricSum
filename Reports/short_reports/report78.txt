Australia 209 for 3 (Warner 89*, Finch 66) beat Afghanistan 207 (Najibullah 51, Rahmat 43, Cummins 3-40, Zampa 3-60) by seven wickets Eleven years after winning the World Cricket League Division Five in the British Isles, Afghanistan completed a remarkable turnaround to make it to their second World Cup, also in the UK, but Australia captain Aaron Finch and his fellow opener David Warner rained on their parade, handing them a seven-wicket defeat. In his first international game after serving a one-year ban for his role in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal, Warner was booed when he walked out to open Australia's 208 chase and later when he reached a half-century. A couple even dressed up in sandpaper boxes. Steven Smith, if anything, drew louder and more persistent boos when he walked out at No. 4.
