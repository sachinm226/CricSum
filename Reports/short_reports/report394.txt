Australians 241 for 8 (Warner 74, Hussey 37, Razzaq 3-39) beat Leicestershire 136 (McKay 4-31) by 102 runs D/L Scorecard David Hussey made 37 from 25 balls Getty Images It took until a little after 7pm for some sun to shine on the canary yellow shirts of Australia's cricketers as they familiarised themselves with a grey English summer against Leicestershire. By then Michael Clarke's tourists had the match in their keeping against modest opposition, and more importantly had taken the chance to spread the day's workload widely among an XI with limited experience of winning in England. Taken in isolation, few of the visitors produced compelling performances. David Warner caught the eye with a percussive 74, and Clint McKay's combination of wholehearted seam-up and the odd perplexing slower ball reaped four wickets, but the rest offered cameos that provided the on-field equivalent of a brief net. A day of 70 overs' cricket was a productive result given the overhead conditions for most of the match, and better than they may get in Belfast against Ireland, where heavy rain is predicted.
