Australians 214 for 9 dec (Forrest 53*) & 87 for 2 (Cowan 28*) beat WICB President's XI 201 (Dwayne Smith 62, Harris 4-23) and 98 (Hilfenhaus 4-8, Lyon 4-17) by eight wicketsScorecard Australia's batsmen were briefly discomforted by spin for a second time before rolling to an eight-wicket victory over the WICB President's XI in the three-day tour match at the Three Ws Oval in Barbados. The occasional leg breaks of Nkrumah Bonner produced some moments of unease for the visiting top order on the final morning as they closed in on a paltry target - captain Michael Clarke perished and Ricky Ponting also came close to losing his wicket before the finish. Ed Cowan built up his familiarity with the Caribbean with a tidy, unbeaten contribution. Cowan, Peter Forrest, Shane Watson, Clarke and Ponting all spent a modicum of time in the middle as they acclimatised to the other side of the world, while the bowling attack of Ryan Harris, Ben Hilfenhaus, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle and Nathan Lyon also had reason to be content with their work on days one and two. However the hosts will not be entirely without optimism on the evidence of this fixture.
