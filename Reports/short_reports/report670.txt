Australia 393 and 0 for 46 (Langer 20*, Hayden 23*) beat England 291 and 147 (McGrath 3-38) by 10 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne say their farewells ? Getty Images Australia surfed a tide of emotion in front of a packed fourth-and-final day crowd, sealing their first Ashes whitewash in 86 years with a ruthless demolition job at Sydney. They had a full two days available to do the necessary, but in the end they needed just under two hours, as England's battered and bruised cricketers surrendered by ten wickets in an abject and embarrassing fashion. Fittingly, it was Glenn McGrath who took centre stage in his final appearance at his home ground, the SCG. After Shane Warne's heroics with the bat, McGrath took over with the ball, grabbing 3 for 38 in 21 typically metronomic overs, before Justin Langer - in partnership with his best mate, Matthew Hayden - rattled off the necessary 46 runs in just 11 overs. It was Hayden who sealed the win, clubbing Sajid Mahmood for six then, after a consultation with Langer, slapping the next for four past point, but McGrath, Langer and Shane Warne were the inevitable stars of the show.
