South Africa 317 for 6 (Gibbs 110, de Villiers 84) beat Australia 256 (Haddin 78, Ponting 53, Clarke 50, Steyn 4-44, van der Merwe 3-46) by 61 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Herschelle Gibbs made his 21st ODI century Associated Press South Africa began the series as the world's No. 1 ODI side and they will finish it in the same position after Herschelle Gibbs' 21st one-day international century helped them to an unassailable 3-1 series lead in Port Elizabeth. Gibbs's near-even time innings of 110 repaid the faith placed in him by South Africa after a stint in rehab late last year, propelling them to a commanding 317 for 6. Australia, who again battled against the spin of Roelof van der Merwe, were seldom in the hunt. The 61-run victory ensured Graeme Smith's men the honour of becoming the first team to triumph in three successive bilateral ODI series against Australia - a streak that dates back to their historic victory in the 438 match in Johannesburg three years ago.
