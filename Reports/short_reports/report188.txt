Australia 2 for 176 (Warner 122*) drew with West Indies 330 (K Brathwaite 85, C Brathwaite 69, Ramdin 62, O'Keefe 3-63, Lyon 3-120) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details After two days of constant rain in Sydney, David Warner produced a torrent of runs on the fifth day to entertain the faithful with the quickest Test century ever recorded at the SCG. A draw was the inevitable result of a Test in which only 150.1 overs were bowled due to wet weather, but Warner's 82-ball hundred at least ensured there was good reason to watch the final day's play. Cricket Australia had thrown open the gates and declared free entry, and the local fans hoped they would see the Australians bat early in the day. Only 68 balls had been possible on day two, and days three and four had been completely washed out, meaning that the only chance of a result would have been if the captains agreed to double-declarations on the final day, but that was not to be.
