Australia 8 for 300 (Bailey 70, Philander 4-45) beat South Africa 268 (de Villiers 80, Miller 65, Coulter-Nile 4-48) by 32 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:55 George Bailey rebuilt Australia's innings with 70 from 75 balls Getty Images It was a tale of three captains at the WACA, where Michael Clarke was injured while batting, his deputy-cum-replacement George Bailey rebuilt Australia's innings, and their South African counterpart AB de Villiers threatened to pull off a record chase. Ultimately the difference was in the fortunes of Bailey and de Villiers: Bailey was dropped four times on his way to 70; de Villiers made a chanceless 80, then was run out in a mix-up with a tail-ender. The loss of de Villiers ended any hope South Africa had of overtaking Australia's 8 for 300. Never before had a team made that many to win a one-day international at the WACA, and in the end South Africa didn't get especially close. A 46-run last-wicket stand could not disguise the lower-order collapse - the previous five wickets fell for 20 runs - and South Africa were dismissed for 268, giving Australia a 32-run win and a 1-0 lead.
