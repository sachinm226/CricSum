Australia 334 for 6 (Ponting 113, Hayden 60) beat Scotland 131 (Smith 51, McGrath 3-14) by 203 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Fraser Watts was the first of Glenn McGrath's three victims when he played on ? Getty Images The Australia fast bowlers might have hogged a bit of the glory, blasting out the Scotland top order for not too many, but the 203-run victory was set up when Ricky Ponting carved out an authoritative hundred. Several others chipped in as Australia posted a virtually unattainable - for Scotland - 334 for 6. Ponting came out to bat with a solid platform in place, the score reading 91 for 1, and the best of the bowling conditions were already gone. He did not go hammer and tongs early on. If anything, he was extra careful, but the ease with which he was picking off the runs off the full stuff egged the Scotland bowlers to slip in the odd short ball.
