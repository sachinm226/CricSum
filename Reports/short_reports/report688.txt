Australia 232 for 3 (Ponting 66*, Symonds 63*) beat Sri Lanka 226 (Jayawardene 72, Silva 64, Bracken 4-19) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Ricky Ponting eased to his fourth 50-plus score of the tournament and finished the game with a lofted straight six ? AFP A couple of Sri Lanka batting collapses turned a potentially cracking contest into a one-sided affair, as Australia wrapped up a comprehensive seven-wicket win. The move to rest Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan weakened Sri Lanka's bowling but it was the unchanged batting line up that faltered on a true surface in Grenada. Australia were clinical, seizing the openings without fail and stamping their authority when it counted. They lost the toss but made full use of the early swing before witnessing a well-crafted 140-run stand between Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva for the fourth wicket. Nathan Bracken gave little away, ending with 4 for 19 from 9.
