England 272 for 5 (Morgan 89*, Trott 54) beat Australia 257 for 9 (Clarke 61, Warner 56) by 15 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Eoin Morgan struck four sixes during the latter part of the England innings Getty Images This is surely one of the most inconsequential England v Australia series in history, but it did not lack for intensity or entertainment for all that and long before the end the Lord's crowd was relishing the renewal of old rivalries. First blood in the NatWest series went to England, but the match felt closer than the final 15-run margin would indicate. Australia's chances departed with their captain, Michael Clarke, who had made 61 from 67 balls when he walked across his stumps, not for the first time, and was aghast to fall plumb lbw to a swinging, low full toss from Tim Bresnan. It aggravated the hurt of the previous over when Australia lost Matthew Wade to a run out. Wade had just lifted James Anderson into the Mound Stand, Clarke had deposited Graeme Swann's offspin into the Tavern and another 69 from 49 balls felt just about gettable.
