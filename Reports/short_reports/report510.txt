Pakistan 258 (Watson 6-33) and 180 for 7 (Farhat 67, Azhar 51) beat Australia 88 and 349 (Smith 77, Clarke 76) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The moment of victory: Umar Gul and Mohammad Aamer scamper through for the winning run Getty Images Pakistan's long, long wait for a Test victory over Australia finally came to an end amid scenes of excruciating tension on the fourth morning at Headingley, as a simple equation of 40 runs for victory with seven wickets still standing was made to look as complex as the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem. They eventually crept home with three men still standing, but their collective nerves in tatters, as Umar Gul launched the winning shot through the covers with the scores already level. The margin of victory looked more comfortable than it felt, and that's putting it mildly. The eventual difference between the sides was the wicketkeeper, Kamran Akmal, whose 13 from 26 balls was as close as Pakistan came to a composed fourth-day performance. That said, had Akmal been given out caught in the gully with five runs still required, who knows what miracles might have transpired.
