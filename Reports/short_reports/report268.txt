Australia 4 for 583 dec (Voges 269*, S Marsh 182, Warner 64, Warrican 3-158) beat West Indies 223 (Bravo 108, Hazlewood 4-45, Lyon 3-43) and 148 (Brathwaite 94, Pattinson 5-27, Hazlewood 3-33) by an innings and 212 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 4:04 Chappell: Where's the West Indies pride? Hapless, hopeless and helpless, West Indies collapsed to their second-heaviest defeat in Tests against Australia as James Pattinson marked his return with a five-wicket haul that destroyed the top order. Australia batted for the first four sessions of the match and lost only four wickets; West Indies batted less than four sessions and lost all their wickets, for both innings, crushed by an innings and 212 runs before tea on the third afternoon. In the end the only real interest was whether Kraigg Brathwaite could reach a second-innings century and carry his bat, but even that proved a step too far. His fighting effort came to halt when he was bowled by Josh Hazlewood for 94, the wicket that confirmed the result as the West Indian No.11 Shannon Gabriel was unable to bat due to a foot injury.
