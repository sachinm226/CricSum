Sri Lanka 157 for 9 (Jayawardene 86, Hastings 3-14, Lee 3-39) beat Australia 149 for 9 (Watson 57, Mendis 6-16) by eight runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There was no stopping Ajantha Mendis today Associated Press Ajantha Mendis turned tricks beyond the grasp of six Australian batsmen as Sri Lanka completed an eight-run victory for a 2-0 sweep of the Twenty20 series at Pallekele. Playing his first, but surely not last, match against the Australians on this tour, Mendis plucked 6 for 16, the best figures in international T20 history, including three of the four wickets to fall for four runs in a frenzied 16-ball phase in the middle overs. All this after Shane Watson's belligerent 57 from 24 balls seemed to have set the visitors up for a series-levelling victory. The pivotal moment of the evening came thanks to Angelo Mathews' remarkable feat of athleticism, when he collected a David Warner heave on the edge of the midwicket boundary, and then threw the ball back into play for Mahela Jayawardene to complete the catch. Watson was close to lbw in the first over of the chase, the umpire ruling that Nuwan Kulasekara's extravagant inswing would have taken the ball past leg stump.
