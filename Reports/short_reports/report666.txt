Australia 6 for 156 (Hussey 46*, Lewis 4-36) beat England 155 by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball commentary How they were out Jon Lewis struck early blows as England fought back after a poor batting performance, but their lack of runs proved crucial in the end ? Getty Images A committed bowling display led by John Lewis eased England's pain, but it was not enough to prevent another defeat that was set up by a dire batting effort. After England spluttered to 155 all out in 42 overs on a strange surface, the home team copied the mistakes and dropped to 4 for 48 before sweating to a four-wicket victory. Despite gaining an unlikely position of strength through Lewis's three-wicket opening, England again released the pressure and Michael Hussey responded with a match-sealing 46. Hussey worked with Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, who finished on 20 after surviving a torrid spell from Andrew Flintoff, to steer the side out of trouble. However, they were fortunate to claim a bonus point from an encounter that turned out to be relatively even.
