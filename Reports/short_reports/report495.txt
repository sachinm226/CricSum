Australia 189 for 8 (Warner 51) beat Windward Islands XI 88 by 101 runs Scorecard David Warner is in excellent touch this week Getty Images The opener David Warner collected his second warm-up half-century as Australia fine-tuned for their opening World Twenty20 match against Pakistan on Sunday with a 101-run win against a Windward Islands XI. The contest provided little more than a run around for the Australians as they swept past an outfit including their squad mates Daniel Christian, Tim Paine and Nathan Hauritz. Warner, who scored 72 in the loss to Zimbabwe on Tuesday, backed up with 51 off 41 balls and David Hussey raced to 49 to set up Australia's 189 for 8. Clarke (30), Cameron White (24) and Shane Watson (17) also contributed as the side tried to find a successful method to prevent a repeat of last year's first-round exit. Hussey's display included three sixes off Hauritz late in the innings as the bowler gave up 34 runs in three overs.
