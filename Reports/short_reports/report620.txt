England 8 for 246 (Collingwood 70, Loye 45) beat Australia 8 for 152 (Hodge 49, Plunkett 3-43) by 34 runs on D/L Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details Liam Plunkett steals Adam Gilchrist's wicket at a crucial time during a fine opening spell ? Getty Images England sparked the shock of the season by handing Australia their first home finals defeat for 14 years in a dramatic rain-reduced game at the SCG. On the same ground where a demoralised England handed over the Ashes last month, Andrew Flintoff completed a smaller but highly satisfying clean sweep by taking the CB Series in two games. The Australians were shocked - and probably embarrassed - when they flopped to 5 for 63 in the 12th over chasing a revised total after Paul Collingwood drove England to 8 for 246. Rain offered a brief reprieve for Australia when it came with the match needing another 22 balls for a result, but the sky cleared for long enough and they lost by 34 runs on Duckworth-Lewis when more wet weather arrived. "To pit our wits against Australia in a final is a great thing for us with a group of young guys," Andrew Flintoff said.
