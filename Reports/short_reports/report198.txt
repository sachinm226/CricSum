Australia 283 for 4 (Marsh 79*, Smith 78, Maxwell 46*) beat West Indies 282 for 8 (Samuels 125, Ramdin 91, Starc 3-51) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell provided overdue contributions in the middle order to help Steven Smith guide Australia into the triangular series final with a six-wicket win over the West Indies at Bridgetown in Barbados. Interim coach Justin Langer had been eager to see how his team responded under the pressure of possible tournament elimination, and Marlon Samuels' fine hundred in partnership with Denesh Ramdin ensured Australia's batsmen had little margin for error at Kensington Oval. However, Smith produced the workmanlike innings of a leader and was able to coax Marsh into one of his best and most complete international innings, albeit on a surface that bore closer resemblance to Australian climes than any other in this series. Maxwell then came in with the game still in the balance - Australia needed 62 off 50 balls - and responded with a starburst of shots that will help his own sense of esteem enormously after a series in which he was dropped for two matches. Even so, the Australians will still want to improve their fielding and bowling, two areas that were found wanting in the afternoon.
