New Zealand 0 for 149 (Vincent 73*, Fleming 70*) beat Australia 148 (Hussey 42, Bond 5-23) by 10 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball commentary How they were out Stephen Fleming's 70 not out made sure of a big win ? Getty Images Shane Bond's love of hurting Australia pushed New Zealand to their third win in five years of Trans-Tasman contests and added to the visitors' severe woes. On the day when Australia's under-strength squad was hit further by the loss of Brett Lee and Michael Clarke to injuries, Bond made their situation much worse by capturing 5 for 23 as they toppled to their first ever ten-wicket loss. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming powered past the tiny target of 149 in the 27th over and Australia must win the final two matches of the Chappell-Hadlee Series to hold their No. 1 ranking. Bond was magnificent on a pitch offering steep bounce and movement and he struck in his first and last overs while taking his tally against Australia to 33 wickets in ten games.
