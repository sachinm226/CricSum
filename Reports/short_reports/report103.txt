Australia 121 for 3 (Short 50) beat New Zealand 150 for 9 (Taylor 43*, Agar 3-27) by 19 runs (DLS method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details After the boom at Eden Park, swiftly came the bust. Five days on from Australia's world-record T20 chase, New Zealand opted to set a target again; this time, after an excellent bowling display on a less-frisky surface, the requirement over 120 balls was almost 100 runs fewer. D'Arcy Short capped an excellent debut series by crunching his second T20I fifty and the match descended into a hit'n'gurgle as the rain swept in for a second time. That Australia did not have to resort to the spectacular with the bat was down to a canny display with the ball. Where 32 sixes had streaked the Auckland skies when these two teams met in the group, the tally barely managed double-figures in the final.
