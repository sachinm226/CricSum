South Africa 291 for 7 (Klaasen 123*, Miller 64, Cummins 3-45) beat Australia 217 (Smith 76, Ngidi 3-30) by 74 runs Heinrich Klaasen's maiden ODI century, David Miller's second successive half-century in this format and a collectively impressive South African performance in the field, led by Lungi Ngidi, earned the hosts a big win in their opening ODI against Australia. After two blow-out batting performances in the T20Is, South Africa put partnerships together to post a competitive total and held their composure to keep a strong Australia line-up largely quiet. Steven Smith's 76 and his 84-run partnership with Marnus Labuschagne was Australia's best hope of chasing down 292, but it was not enough. They needed at least another stand of significance, as South Africa had on a surface where run-scoring was hard work. After slipping to 48 for 3, Klaasen and debutant Kyle Verreynne laid the foundation with a partnership of 78, before Klaasen and Miller built on it with a 149-run stand that allowed South Africa to aim for 300.
