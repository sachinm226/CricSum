Australia 286 for 7 (Michael Hussey 83*, Haddin 53) beat South Africa 145 (Smith 52, Hauritz 4-29) by 141 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Nathan Hauritz and Michael Hussey: architects of a crushing Australian victory AFP Australia bossed South Africa in game one of the five-match contest, putting up an imposing score and then strangling wickets at regular intervals to win by 141 runs and reclaim, at least temporarily, the No. 1 one-day ranking. An assured half-century from Michael Hussey propelled Australia after a shaky start and then the bowlers performed as a tight unit to demolish South Africa's batting. Leading the rout in the field was Nathan Hauritz, with career-best figures in a testing spell of off spin. South Africa's chase was dented early.
