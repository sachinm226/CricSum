Australia 5 for 329 (Finch 109, Smith 73*, Warner 53) beat South Africa 256 (Amla 102, de Villiers 52, Starc 4-32, Hazlewood 3-51) by 73 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:47 Finch steers Australia to 2-1 lead Centurion Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc were central figures in Australia's commanding 73-run victory over South Africa in Canberra, despite a pair of sparkling innings by Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers. In front of a crowd of 10,583 at Manuka Oval, Finch set the platform and Smith capitalised fully upon it against a South African bowling attack that found less assistance than they enjoyed in Perth but also did not help their cause with a quartet of no-balls. Dale Steyn was the lone exemplar of parsimony for the visitors, but even his 10 overs ultimately yielded 53 runs, and he was unable to take the wickets he had yearned for when describing a new attack role for himself on match eve. Aaron Finch and David Warner added 118 for the opening wicket Getty Images A target of 330 was always going to be difficult for the visitors given Australia's selection of a deep and varied bowling attack that in Starc and Hazlewood had relevant experience of Canberra climes. Hazlewood and Starc both bowled piercingly with the old ball, the latter gaining sharp reverse swing to bring a swift conclusion to the match.
