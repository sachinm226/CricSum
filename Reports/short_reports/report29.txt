Bangladesh 122 for 8 (Naim 23, Ellis 2-16, Christian 2-17) beat Australia 62 (Wade 22, Shakib 4-9, Saifuddin 3-12) by 60 runs It was a nightmarish end to a tough tour for Australia. As if losing the series wasn't enough, in the final T20I, they lost 8 for 24 to collapse to 62 all out in a chase of 123. This was their lowest total across limited-overs cricket. It meant Bangladesh took the series 4-1 in Dhaka. Shakib Al Hasan, who nabbed his 100th T20I wicket on the way, led with a haul of 4 for 9, with Mohammad Saifuddin grabbing 3 for 12 as Bangladesh choked Australia, not for the first time, with spin.
