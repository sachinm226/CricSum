Australia 199 for 5 (Warner 106, Bailey 44, Dilruwan 3-51) beat Sri Lanka 195 (Gunathilaka 39, Starc 3-40) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For the fifth time in the series Sri Lanka batted first and a vaguely familiar match played out as Australia ran down the hosts' 195 in the 43rd over, zipping up the series 4-1. Mitchell Starc was denied his customary early wicket this time, but Sri Lanka's middle-order collapse happened anyway, as it often has in the past two weeks. Australia's top order then delivered another consummate performance on a spinning track; the margin of victory was five wickets, but it seemed even more comfortable than that. It was David Warner, who provided the spine to this particular chase. He capped an outstanding eight days as captain by scoring Australia's first ODI century in Sri Lanka - his 106 from 126 balls measured and delicate, in contrast to his usual maurauding style.
