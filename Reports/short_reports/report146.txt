Australia 6 for 353 (Warner 130, Maxwell 78, Head 51, Hasan 5-52) beat Pakistan 267 (Sharjeel 74, Hazlewood 3-54, Zampa 3-55) by 86 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A David Warner hundred. A catalogue of Pakistan fielding errors. A big win for Australia. It was as if the fourth one-day international in Sydney was a recap of the Test campaign earlier this summer. Certainly the result was the same - a series victory for Australia.
