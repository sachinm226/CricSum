Derbyshire 235 for 5 (Rogers 93, Madsen 58, Johnson 2-17) drew with Australians 436 Scorecard Chris Rogers cuts during his 93 Getty Images Mitchell Johnson picked up two wickets and deprived Chris Rogers of a century against his one-time team-mates on a middling day for Australia's bowlers against Derbyshire. On their only day of match bowling before the first Test against Pakistan, the Australians took a while to work into their rhythm but gradually chipped away and when play was called off they had Derbyshire at 235 for 5. In his return to the senior Australian side, Ben Hilfenhaus worked hard and was eventually rewarded with the wicket of Dan Redfern, who cut to gully and was caught by a juggling Marcus North. Johnson was comfortably the best of the bowlers and removed both openers during a very good spell of fast and aggressive bowling. Rogers and Wayne Madsen had frustrated the Australians during a 147-run opening stand that finally ended when Madsen flashed hard outside off stump and was gloved by Tim Paine.
