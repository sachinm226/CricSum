Australia 106 for 0 (Gilchrist 59*, Hayden 47*) beat Bangladesh 104 for 6 (Mortaza 25*, Saqibul 25, Bashar 24, McGrath 3-16) by 10 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Glenn McGrath rocked Bangladesh and became the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history ? AFP Australia were always favourites to bludgeon Bangladesh, but the fact that their Super Eights match was reduced to a mere 22-over-a-side affair made the thrashing appear much more severe. After putting Bangladesh in and keeping them to 104 for 6 - Glenn McGrath picked up 3 for 16 to become the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history - the rampaging Australians barnstormed to the first ten-wicket win of the tournament. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden give bowlers nightmares at the best of times, and when they come out to bat with a license to hit every ball out of sight, and end up doing almost just that, the only emotion you feel is sympathy for those at the receiving end. Gilchrist hit back down the pitch with such exquisite timing that the fielders at mid-on and mid-off had no chance whatsoever. Hayden, who was literally licking his lips at the prospect of nine of the 22 overs being compulsory Powerplays in the rain-affected circumstances, struck sweet blows of his own, but for once was overshadowed.
