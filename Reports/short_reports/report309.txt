South Africa 3 for 145 (Rossouw 78, de Kock 46) beat Australia 6 for 144 (Watson 47, Faulkner 41*, Abbott 3-21) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kyle Abbott harried Australia's batsmen and Rilee Rossouw achieved the rare feat of putting Quinton de Kock in the shade during a stand of 129 as South Africa secured a vast opening win in the Twenty20 match at Adelaide Oval. Three days after they were comfortably beaten by a Cricket Australia Invitational XI in Sydney, the tourists combined impressively with ball and bat to deliver Australia's third consecutive international defeat, albeit against two distinctly different teams in two vastly different formats on opposite sides of the globe. The likes of David Warner, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell were missed by the Australians, but it must also be acknowledged that Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers were among South Africa's absentees. Abbott and Rossouw were highly capable substitutes, the former's 3 for 21 and the latter's 78 from 50 balls the most telling contributions for JP Duminy's men. Reeza Hendricks was out to a well-pitched delivery from Doug Bollinger in the first over of South Africa's chase, but Rossouw and de Kock had very few difficulties in rattling towards the target and ensuring that by the time they departed the asking rate was negligible.
