This is research study on a Cricket news generation from live text commentary using pre-trained models
Cricket is one of the most played and popular games in the world. There
are roughly 1 billion cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Most people rely on live text
commentaries rather than watching live video streaming of the Cricket match. This
resulted in the emergence of online websites providing live text commentaries. As
a result, a massive amount of live text data relating to cricket was generated.
There isnâ€™t a lot of work done on summarising a cricket game using this live text
of Cricket game. Therefore, we implemented a system to generate news from the
live text commentaries of Cricket games. Data is collected from the ESPNCricinfo
website. Stakeholders may use our proposed model for the automatic creation of
news articles, which eliminates human effort and time spent drafting the report. We
have trained different models over commentary data and the best model is selected
based on the ROUGE score
