0,"16.6;?;Starc to Russell, no run slower ball as he misfires another attempted yorker, but Russell howls after swinging wildly over a knee high full toss on seventh stump. His eyes lit up smelling another six but forgot to bite.;"
1,"9.12 pm The Australia bowlers were magnificent in the Powerplay to strangle West Indies' top order and, with the exception of Mitchell Starc, continued through the rest of the innings as well to keep everyone bar Andre Russell in check. 145 feels way below part on this wicket. Hazlewood ends with 3 for 12 in his four overs as the standout bowler while Marsh winds up with 2 for 26. It will take something special from the West Indies in the field to keep Australia from chasing this down. Stay with us for the start of the chase when Andrew McGlashan will be back in the central commentary position."
2,Walsh Jr to bowl his last now. Over the stumps to Starc with a slip in place.
3,"Walsh to Starc, 1 run loopy low full toss on the legs stroked calmly to long-on along the turf."
4,"Walsh to Christian, 1 wide darts this in flatter and fuller down leg, Christian is late on a sweep but wide called."
5,"Walsh to Christian, no run good length ball on fourth stump, goes back to cut and scuffs this back into the ground."
6,"Walsh to Starc, no run good length ball on fifth stump slapped into the off side."
7,"Walsh to Starc, 1 run good length ball on fifth stump, goes back to slap wide of cover for one."
8,"Walsh to Zampa, no run good length ball on off, goes back to defend."
9,"McCoy to Starc, no run slower ball lands on a good length on sixth stump, Starc flails at this flat-footed and in vain."
10,"McCoy to Starc, no run fullish length slower ball on off stump, defended on the front foot back to McCoy."
11,"McCoy to Starc, no run slower ball cutter knuckles away from sixth stump on a good length as Starc fans on another shot."
12,"McCoy to Starc, OUT what a catch by Allen running to his right from cow corner! Another slower ball, another one bites the dust. It landed full on off stump and Starc went for a big heave but miscued it off the inner half of the bat. It floated high in the air between Allen at cow corner and Walsh Jr at long-on, the two speediest and best catching fielders in the West Indies team. Their speed to the ball nearly results in a catastrophic collision as both were going pedal to the medal for the chance but Walsh Jr sees Allen out of the corner of his eye and pulls out as Allen continues with his diving effort to hold onto the chance five yards inside the rope."
13,"McCoy to Zampa, 1 run full on the stumps, chips this through midwicket for one."
14,"If you're out of breath from that finish, there's very little time to recover before these sides take the field again! They'll be back at it in St Lucia less than 24 hours from now for the second T20I of the five-match series. I'll be back with Andrew McGlashan for the ball-by-ball call. Until then, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care!"
15,"10:44 pm An 18-run margin makes this match look far easier for the West Indies than it was in reality. Australia dominated the first 10 overs of both innings but an inconceivable collapse in the chase will give them plenty to reflect on. Andre Russell gave West Indies hope with his 51 off 28 balls, a maiden T20I fifty too, to resuscitate the West Indies innings after Australia had the host lineup pinned down early. It was a carbon copy scenario in the second innings as Australia smothered the West Indies bowlers before a startling collapse from 89 for 3 to 127 all out. They were 117 for 5 and lost their last five wickets for 10 runs too. Hayden Walsh Jr takes career-best figures of 3 for 23 to spearhead the West"
