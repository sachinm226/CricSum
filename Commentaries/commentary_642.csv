0,"Lee to Maddy, 1 run forward defensive to a slow loosener, drops into the on side, no more than a few yards, and a scurried single to loud cheers"
1,"Lee to Prior, no run back of a length, on off stump, Prior half forward and defends to point"
2,"Lee to Prior, no run fuller, driven but not timed, his top hand comes off the bat as he plays the stroke and it dribbles to mid-off"
3,"Lee to Prior, no run wider, 85mph, no shot offered"
4,"Lee to Prior, 1 run dropped into the leg side, a quick single, Maddy, the non striker, ran in a straight line and Lee swerved across the pitch and the two collided ... Maddy got home safely and it was Lee who was left on the turf"
5,"Lee to Maddy, 2 runs short, cut over backward point, third man round quickly to field"
6,"Bracken to Prior, no run wide, slanted across Prior, a swing and a mess and our lipreading expert points out he said something very uncouth"
7,"Bracken to Prior, no run on the button, blocked into the leg side but the field are wise to that after two singles in the last over and they swoop"

10,"Bracken to Prior, 1 run plopped into the covers, soft hands so the ball dribbles no more than ten yards, and that allows a comfortable single"
11,"Bracken to Maddy, 1 run bat and pad together defensively, and again they settle for a well-run single into the off side"
12,"Lee to Maddy, no run wide, Maddy looks to cut but it's too close to him and he ends up much too cramped"
13,"Lee to Maddy, no run same again, and this one cuts back as well so he gets even more cramped and once more misses"

27,"Johnson to Maddy, 1 run Maddy back, lets the ball hit the bat and a single as it plops into the on side"

40,"Johnson to Wright, OUT Johnson swings it across Wright who slogs and gets a thick outside edge, Gilchrist does the rest"
