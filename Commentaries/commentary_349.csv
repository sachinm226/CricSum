4,"Bopara to Watson, no run there's a mix up and England could have had a run-out at both ends! Watson pushed the ball to mid-off and both he and Finch set off before realising there wasn't a run, Root could have thrown it to Buttler at the striker's end, decided to have a shy at the bowler's end and missed, with both batsmen out of their ground"

228,"Finn to Faulkner, 1 run another ball just back in length, Faulkner did too much on the crease and ended up leg side of it and had to angle it down to third man, had he stood still he could have aimed another leg side swipe at it"
229,"Finn to Voges, 2 runs full, wahey, on the stumps, dabbed into midwicket and they get two wide of long-on but had they set a proper field for full bowling there would surely have been a midwicket saving one"

265,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run length ball a foot wide of off stump, dabbed into the covers, too close to the fielder though"

270,"Johnson to Trott, 1 wide leg slip in straight away, bowled for the tuck to leg slip but got it too far down leg"
271,"Johnson to Trott, OUT got him! Super delivery, back of a length, it bounced a little on Trott right on line and he nicked it through to Wade a cracking delivery from Johnson.

295,"Johnson to Root, 1 run short down the leg side, Root goes to hook it and gets a tickle on it, Wade diving to his left and the chance is dropped and a chance that should have been taken.

302,"Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs tries to force off the back foot through cover and gets a thick inside edge past the off stump, so narrowly past off stump, and past the keeper to fine leg, a perfect Chinese cut"
303,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run touch fuller, angled towards cover point from just outside off"

450,"McKay to Buttler, 1 run driven firmly from just outside off stump, can't get it past mid-off though"
451,"McKay to Morgan, 2 runs short outside off, slapped wide of long-on but not wide enough as the fielder is able to save four"
452,"McKay to Morgan, OUT full outside off, tried to be swung over the leg side but it comes off a swirling outside edge that presents a chance to cover running back and Clarke clings on reaching over his shoulder. A total miscue from Morgan and England's task just got a little stiffer. He was aiming one of those whippy flicks over long-on but was t"

454,"McKay to Buttler, 2 runs slower ball, 67mph, on the stumps, spotted and dabbed through midwicket, they run hard and get two"

466,"McKay to Stokes, OUT yet again slow, 65mph, pulled from outside off, nowhere near enough bat on it, comes off a top edge and flies straight down the throat of deep backward square leg.

469,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run, OUT and another, this straight and flicked into midwicket, they sprint back for two but oh dear Tredwell is pretty slow and has been run out that was very laboured, perhaps he wasn't expecting the second run but what seemed an easy two with deep midwicket having to run around the ball to get a return in to the bowler"

474,"Johnson to Finn, no run a touch fuller but still getting up to chest height, Finn gets tucked up and wears it on the upper arm"
475,"Johnson to Finn, 1 run step to leg and a pretty nasty-looking heave to leg that he doesn't connect with at all, it comes off high on the bat, ends up playing it one-handed, gets it wide of midwicket for a single though"

510,"Fawad to Buttler, OUT goes again but this is straight up, Johnson goes back from mid-on a few yards and takes a comfortable catch. He's thumped a few nicely today Buttler but that was a total miscue that went a long way up off a top edge, trying again to swing away a ball floated up on the stumps. Good solid catch from Johnson"

516,"McKay to Finn, OUT full on the stumps, Finn tries to clear the leg side again but picks out deep midwicket and that'll do nicely for Australia.

517,"End of the game and Australia have dominated today, winning by 88 runs and it was a complete performance. They began with racking up a tasty total through Michael Clarke's first ODI hundred against England; Clarke following up his ton at Old Trafford in the Test match. George Bailey also played an excellent innings, looking in superb touch and playing"
518,"Australia's bowling effort was probably the more impressive part of the match. They had Mitchell Johnson in great form, bowling with pace and aggression and ripping out two early wickets to handicap England's effort. It was a sign that perhaps Johnson will be ready to return to Test duty come Novemeber. He was backed up exceptionally well by Clint McK"
519,"As for England, they made the wrong choice at the toss, failed to cap Australia's surge until the damage had been done and then never got close in the chase. Kevin Pietersen played nicely before a poor stroke ended the big innings that England needed from him. Eoin Morgan threatened to play his own big part but fell trying to push things on in the Pow"
520,"So that wraps up this first ODI. David Hopps has described in detail Australia's thumping victory and Dan Brettig is in position to bring us more reaction from Old Trafford later in the evening. The next match in the series is on Wednesday down at Edgbaston, so join us then for a floodlit match starting at 2pm BST but from Monty and I today it's goodb"
