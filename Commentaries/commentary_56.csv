30,"Jhye Richardson to Rahul, SIX runs full and wide outside off, and lifted into the stands! Width offered, and Rahul prods forward before confidently driving over the infield. Someone in the crowd makes a mess of the catch too"

35,"Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs what a shot! Full on middle, right near his toes, and he nonchalantly flicks this over deep midwicket! All the work done by Rahul's bottom-hand. Proper whippage"

37,"Cummins to Rahul, no run Rahul's down! Back of a length on middle, and he looks to defend, but the ball holds it's line, and hits Rahul near his abdomen. He falls forward, facepalming the pitch, but his feet are inside the crease. 53 for 0 after the Powerplay"

49,"Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye offcutter, full outside leg stump. Dhawan tries to whip this behind square, but ball hits his front leg. No appeal for lbw, since the ball didn't pitch on the stumps. Ball rolls away to the leg side as the batsmen pinch a single"
50,"Zampa to S Dhawan, 1 run full on middle, and pushed off the front foot to cover for a quick single"
51,"Zampa to Kohli, no run length ball, wide outside off, and turning further away. Kohli tries to defend, but toe-ends the shot to the off side"

55,"Zampa to Kohli, 2 runs slider on middle, and Kohli pulls along the ground to deep midwicket. Kohli completes the single quickly, but pushes Dhawan for the second. Sharp throw from Jhye Richardson and it's a direct hit! But Kohli's dive saves him. That was closer than he would've liked. Big roar from the crowd"
56,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run play and a miss! Back of a length outside off, and he goes for the pull. Ball whizzes under his bat"
57,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT full outside off, and he opens the bat's face to drive over cover. Stoinis, though, runs in from the boundary and dives forward to take a stunning catch. But it's been taken so close to the ground, that the umpires want to have a second look. Not sure which team will be happier with the wicket. Replays suggest that the ball did hit the ground, but his fingers may have been under it by then. Soft signal was out so this should"
58,"Behrendorff to Kohli, 1 run full on off, and guided off the front foot to third man for a single"
59,"Behrendorff to Pant, no run length ball, wide outside off, and he presses forward to punch. Stopped by cover"

64,"Short to Pant, no run and again, a nice-looking, firmly struck cut, straight to backward point"
65,"Short to Pant, no run ripping turn this time, similar line and length to the previous two balls. Pant is unsure whether to cut or leave, and he ends up not connecting"
66,"Short to Pant, OUT gone, the pressure's told on Pant! Tosses this one up enticingly, a fair way outside off stump, and Pant goes for the big heave and loses his shape. Wasn't quite full enough for him to control perfectly, and it turns and skews up in the air for Jhye Richardson to take an outstanding catch, sprinting to his left from long-off and throwing himself horizontally at the ball"
67,"Short to Dhoni, no run very full on off stump, jabbed to midwicket"
68,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run shortish, close to off stump, hurries through and Kohli pulls along the ground to long-on"
69,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run ooh, that skids through, and is past Dhoni and leads to a hesitant appeal for a stumping. Up it goes to the third umpire. Quickish ball outside off, dips a little shorter than Dhoni expects as he walks forward to try and play it into the covers. Goes with the angle, past his inside edge, but he does extremely well, almost does a full split, to stretch his back leg back and juuust land it past the line"
70,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run flighted a little slower outside off, slapped to cover"
71,"Zampa to Dhoni, 1 run a bit of flight again, this time he flat-bats down to long-off"

73,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run tossed up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
74,"Short to Kohli, 1 run flattish, back of a length, angling across the stumps from over the wicket. Rocks back to pull to the right of long-on"
75,"Short to Dhoni, no run slowed down, pitching just outside leg. Dhoni goes down on one knee for the leg-side heave, plays too early and misses and is hit on the back leg"
76,"Short to Dhoni, SIX runs another delivery along a similar trajectory, flighted and inviting Dhoni to go for another slog-sweep. Dhoni watches it better this time, and the ball soars way over the midwicket boundary"
77,"Short to Dhoni, no run flatter now, on middle stump, goes back to whip it but can't get it past midwicket"
78,"Short to Dhoni, 1 run short googly outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"

80,"Cummins to Kohli, 2 runs length ball outside off, carved up and over the covers, to the right of the sweeper. Not quite middled - he may have wanted to hit it straighter than where it landed up"
81,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on off stump, pulled to long leg, off the inner half of the bat. Kohli seems to be going a little too hard at some of his shots today"
82,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run back of a length on off stump, opens up a touch and flat-bats to extra-cover"
83,"Cummins to Dhoni, FOUR runs fuller now, angling into middle and off, and Dhoni hammers it away, clearing his front leg and simply bashing it down the ground, between the bowler and mid-off"

88,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, punched to long-off"
89,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, SIX runs length ball on off stump, and Kohli shuffles away from the line to make a bit of room, and lofts it cleanly, into the gap and over the boundary, to the left of long-off"
90,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs a bit wider, Kohli has to reach out for it. Goes hard at the ball, a kind of front-foot uppercut, and third man, running to his right and diving, can't quite get to it before it bounces, but he can keep it from going to the boundary. Zampa the fielder"
91,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run ooh, that was pretty much in the slot, and Kohli isn't too pleased with himself. Fullish, a bit of width outside off, and Kohli swings a little too early and misses his lofted off drive. May have been the slower ball, mind"
92,"Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, 2 runs slower ball, back of a length, angling into the body. Dhoni swivels to pull it off his hip towards long leg"
93,"Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, 1 run slower ball, full and fairly wide of off. Dhoni drags it along the ground to long-on, bringing his bottom hand into play"
94,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, SIX runs and yet, he can hit shots like this. Another slower ball, on a length and finishing on about off stump. Kohli just brings his wrists into play and flicks it all the way over the midwicket boundary"
95,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, SIX runs and another! Similar length, wider this time, and Kohli frees his arms to deposit it high over the extra-cover boundary"
96,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, SIX runs That's a Mahendra Singh Kohli shot alright! A couple of steps down the pitch to the off-stump length ball, and he brings his wrists into play once more to whip it high over the forward square leg boundary"
97,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, 1 run stump-high full-toss on off stump, clipped down to deep midwicket"
98,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, pulled to deep midwicket"
99,"Zampa to Dhoni, 1 run this is a good, containing length for this pitch. Flat and hurrying through at just under stump height. Goes deep in his crease to whip to long-on"
100,"Zampa to Kohli, no run flat again, but much fuller this time, right up near Kohli's back leg. Has to drag his front leg away from the line to try and flick it, and misses. Hits his back leg, but easily missing leg stump"
101,"Zampa to Kohli, no run flat length ball outside off, goes on the back foot to chop it to backward point"
102,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run flat again, on middle and leg, goes back and punches to deep midwicket with a straight bat to bring up his fifty"
103,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run again that hard-to-attack length, on off stump. Dhoni makes a bit of room to cut, a few yards to the right of backward point"
104,"Short to Kohli, 1 run dangled up slow on leg stump, slog-swept on the bounce to deep midwicket"
105,"Short to Dhoni, SIX runs floated up and right in Dhoni's slot on off stump. Clears his front leg and gives it the full bottom-hand treatment to deposit it beyond the wide long-on boundary"
106,"Short to Dhoni, 1 run flatter, more leg-stumpish. Looks to pull but not quite short enough, drags it to the left of short fine leg off the inner half of his bat"
107,"Short to Kohli, 1 run fullish and quickish on off stump, makes some room and flat-bats it hard to long-off"
108,"Short to Dhoni, SIX runs monstered. Flights it again, lands it in MS's hitting arc just outside off stump, and he simply clears his front leg and hoicks it high over the midwicket boundary, that's landing in row L on any ground in the world"
109,"Short to Dhoni, FOUR runs what a costly decision this has been, giving Short the 18th over. Shortish, on off stump, makes a bit of room and slaps it away to the point boundary"
110,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run full slower ball outside off, quite wide. Goes hard at it, looking to hit over cover, and misses"
111,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 wide excellent wide yorker, almost. Maybe a harsh call from Anil Chaudhary too - only marginally past the tramline, but Kohli had shuffled across in premeditation too. Reached out for it but couldn't connect"
112,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, SIX runs bam. Doesn't get his attempted wide yorker wide enough or full enough, and Kohli takes a step across his stumps to get a little closer and swing through the line to clear the long-off boundary comfortably"
113,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 run low full-toss outside off, driven to long-off"
114,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run slower ball, back of a length, close to off stump, flat-batted down to long-on"
115,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs low full-toss wide of off stump, great hands from Kohli to play a sliced drive into the gap between backward point and sweeper cover. Sharp running too to pick up two"
116,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, FOUR runs wow. Full outside off and Kohli steps across once again and frees his arms through a hard, flat hit straight back over the umpire's head - not that far over - and run away to the boundary in a flash"
117,"Cummins to Dhoni, 1 wide wide yorker gone horribly wrong. Dhoni doesn't even attempt to play it, and Handscomb throws himself across the turf to prevent it from running away for even more runs"
118,"Cummins to Dhoni, 1 wide another wide outside off stump. Slower short ball, and Dhoni has to reach for it to try and cut it. Can't connect"
119,"Cummins to Dhoni, OUT miscued, and Dhoni won't get his fifty. Cummins bowls a cross-seam ball, just short of a good length, on about off stump, and Dhoni, aiming towards long-on, slices it instead and long-off takes a simple catch walking a few steps forward off the rope"
120,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run slower bouncer, gets up to head height over off stump. Kohli shapes to hook and has to adjust to the lack of pace. Helps it along the ground through wide mid-on"
121,"Cummins to Karthik, FOUR runs back of a length on off stump and DK doesn't middle it, but he won't care. Goes for the cleared-front-leg pull and drags it off the inside half of his bat, into the gap to the left of short fine leg"
122,"Cummins to Karthik, FOUR runs slower bouncer outside off, and DK waits, waits some more, and uppercuts firmly, up and over short third man, to the right of the fielder"
123,"Cummins to Karthik, 1 leg bye quick length ball, angling into DK's legs to try and deny him room. Clears his front leg and looks to whip over the leg side, misses, but they sneak a quick leg-bye even as Cummins closes down the ball in his follow-through"
124,"Cummins to Kohli, SIX runs down the track, Cummins tries to bowl a slower ball out of his reach, well outside off, but doesn't quite succeed. He only allows Kohli to free his arms, and he does so gleefully to launch a crisp hit over the long-off boundary"
125,"8.40pm What a finish. That was Kohli's sixth six. India have clattered 117 in the last 10 overs. Seventy-seven Ninety-one of those came in the last six overs. And yet, they haven't gotten to 200, and Australia are still very much in this game. India, remember, have a weakened attack and are relying on their two allrounders, Krunal Pandya and Vijay Shankar, to bowl eight overs between them. Do join us for the chase. Sreshth will be with you very soon."
126,"8.46pm Hello, and welcome back to the second innings. Still a few minutes to go before the second innings gets underway. Make no mistake, this is barely an above-par total at the Chinnaswamy, but the wicket was double-paced for the first ten overs. Shankar to bowl"
127,"Shankar to Short, FOUR runs inswing first up, but drilled through the covers! Full on off, and coming into Short, but he times this well to the wide long-off boundary"
128,"Shankar to Short, 1 run length ball, much better line. Once again jagging inwards, and Short inside-edges a flick right onto his pads. Ball rolls away to the off side as they scamper across for a single"
129,"Shankar to Stoinis, no run back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis carefully defends off the back foot"
130,"Shankar to Stoinis, FOUR runs length ball, on off stump, and this pace will not bother Stoinis. Swivels, and pulls in front of square to the midwicket boundary"

132,"Shankar to Stoinis, no run full and wide outside off, and he presses forward to drive. Struck well, but intercepted at cover point"
133,"Bumrah to Short, 1 run length ball on leg, and angling across Short. He tiptoes and steers a back-foot tap to point"
134,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs length ball, wide outside off but coming inwards. Punched firmly through the infield, but Krunal chases after it, and parries the ball back to his partner. Solid throw from the deep to MSD"
135,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length outside off, and he rides the bounce to punch. Off the bat's top-half, and it rolls away to mid off"
136,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length outside off, and the ball doesn't bounce as much as Stoinis expected it to. Tiptoes to punch, but toe-ends the shot to mid-off this time"
137,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run full outside off, and Stoinis is deceived by the slower ball (116kph). Looks to drive through the covers, but splices the shot to midwicket instead"
138,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length outside off, and the ball jags away slightly. Cut away - but not well - to point for a single"
139,"Kaul to Stoinis, no run full just outside off stump, and driven away from his body to mid off. Mistimed on this occasion"
140,"Kaul to Finch, no run full outside off, and a bit of outswing from Kaul. Maxi Finch looks to drive away from his body, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
141,"Kaul to Finch, 2 runs length ball, wide outside off, and he cuts this into the ground. Ball takes an awkward bounce as it's goes over point, but Rahul manages to get a hand to it, and slow the ball's pace down"
142,"Kaul to Finch, 2 runs misfield! From Rahul. Full ball outside off, and the square drive seems to go straight to point. But ball goes through him, and he's forced to give the ball a chase"

144,"Shankar to Short, no run back of a length on middle, and Short shapes up to pull. Mistimes a flat-batted shot to mid-on"
145,"Shankar to Short, no run length ball on middle, and angling away from Short. Cut square, but can't thread the gap"
146,"Shankar to Short, 1 run back of a length on middle, and nudged off the back foot to the sweeper-fielder on the leg side. A walking single for Short"
147,"Shankar to Finch, FOUR runs length ball on middle, and worked off his hips to the leg side. Placed behind square, and the fielder at deep midwicket is too far away"
148,"Shankar to Finch, no run length ball just outside off. Finch offers the bat's straight face to defend, and taps it back to Shankar"
149,"Bumrah to Short, no run appeal for lbw but Bumrah withdraws after realising there's an inside edge. Length ball on leg, and Short misses the swipe towards midwicket"

151,"Bumrah to Short, 1 run full on middle, and he takes a step backward again, deep into his crease. Pushed to mid-off"

153,"Bumrah to Short, 1 run full on leg stump, and clipped to deep square leg for a walking single"
154,"Bumrah to Maxwell, SIX runs top-edged, but goes all the way! Short ball that's soaring over Maxwell's head, but he attempts to pull, and gets enough connection to clear the boundary behind Dhoni"
155,"Kaul to Short, no run full on middle, and swinging slightly away. Driven away from his body, but mistimed to cover's left"
156,"Kaul to Short, FOUR runs full on off, and crunched! Just a bit of width, and he picks this early. Smacks it past cover's left for a much-needed boundary. Just four balls left in the Powerplay"
157,"Kaul to Short, 1 run back of a length on middle, and he raises his front leg, before pulling along the ground to deep backward square"
158,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on off, and he works this - off his hips - to the gap near square leg. Just a single on offer though"
159,"Kaul to Short, FOUR runs full toss wide outside off, and he slaps this freebie to the extra-cover boundary for four. No movement of the feet, all the power coming from his quick hands. Short's not missing those"

162,"Shankar to Maxwell, FOUR runs length ball on middle, and paddled over square leg! Delivery angling in, and he helps the ball over the infielder"

167,"Chahal to Short, 1 run back of a length, quickish, on off stump, worked away through midwicket"
168,"Chahal to Maxwell, FOUR runs shot! That wasn't all that short, and it was pitcing on middle stump and turning away a reasonable deal, but Maxwell rocks back and puts his bottom wrist to full use for a whip-pull that easily beats deep midwicket to his left"
169,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run fuller, on the pads. Misses the flick, or maybe gets an edge on it, and the ball rolls towards short fine leg off the outside of his front pad"
170,"Chahal to Short, 1 wide nice idea, but the execution goes slightly wrong. The quicker slider, angled away from Short and forcing him to reach out to drive. Just ends up angling it too wide"
171,"Chahal to Short, 1 run googly on a length, worked away wide of midwicket"
172,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to bowl that wide line he's bowled with success to Maxwell, but ends up bowling it too wide. Left alone"
173,"Chahal to Maxwell, 2 runs back of a length on the pads, nudged away through square leg, and doesn't put too much weight on the shot, so they can scamper two"
174,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run wide length ball, rocks back to slap it to sweeper cover"
175,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run flat, back of a length, angling into the stumps, makes room and punches to extra-cover"
176,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run not that short, angling into middle stump, rocks back and pulls to the left of deep midwicket. Kept slightly low but he watched it well and crouched a little while playing the shot"
177,"Krunal to Short, FOUR runs flat, slanted across the left-hander, no turn back in. Lovely shot from Short, hangs back and chops it away to the left of the diving backward point fielder. Not the most athletic-looking effort from Bumrah"
178,"Krunal to Short, 1 run back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to long-off"
179,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run fired into the pads, clipped into the backward square leg region"
180,"Krunal to Short, FOUR runs length ball on off stump, and that's easily put away, just frees his arms and hits it flat and hard, back over the bowler's head"
181,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run fairly full, on the pads, clipped down to long-on"
182,"Chahal to Short, 1 run gone, that's an excellent... wait, that's just slipped through Rishabh Pant's grasp at backward point. Short outside off and Short cuts uppishly. Pant dives forward and to his right, and the ball bursts through his hands about a foot off the ground. A dropped chance, relatively straightforward"
183,"Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs shot! A bit of flight outside off, and Maxwell has lofted that effortlessly over the wide long-off boundary"
184,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run looks to clip this through the leg side, closes his face early and sends a leading edge rolling into the point region"
185,"Chahal to Short, 1 run fairly full outside off and Short goes for the big loft. Doesn't connect cleanly, and luckily for him it goes flat and bounces well short of long-off"
186,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run fired into the pads, clipped away through midwicket"
187,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run flat, back of a length, keeps going with the angle towards the batsman. Clears his front leg to pull but it isn't short enough and sneaks under to hit thigh pad"
188,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run fuller now, clipped quietly to long-on"
189,"Krunal to Short, 1 run flat, back of a length, turning from off to middle, stays back and whips through square leg"
190,"Krunal to Maxwell, FOUR runs and Maxwell still finds the boundary. Floats this full and wide, seemingly secure with long-off and extra-cover back, but Maxwell is able to flat-bat this much straighter, bringing his bottom hand into play, and find the gap to the right of long-off"
191,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run slower this time, on leg stump. Looks to flick and pops a leading edge just out of reach of Krunal, leaping to his left with left arm outstretched"
192,"Krunal to Short, 1 run length ball on off stump, stays back and slaps it to long-off"
193,"Shankar to Maxwell, no run short outside off, stops on the batsman a little and he chops it down to point"
194,"Shankar to Maxwell, FOUR runs slower ball, but it's misdirected, on the pads, and Maxwell still finds enough pace to use and glance it away fine, a long way to the right of long leg who's stationed quite square"
195,"Shankar to Maxwell, 1 run another slower ball, loopy and descending onto Maxwell's front foot. Clipped to long leg"
196,"Shankar to Handscomb, 1 run back of a length outside off, stabbed away into the cover point region. Doesn't come on for the cut and he ends up meeting it well in front of his body"
197,"Shankar to Maxwell, 1 wide slower ball gone wrong, ends up whanging it waaay outside off stump"
198,"Shankar to Maxwell, SIX runs wham. He's bowled a lot of slower balls, and Maxwell was well prepared. Back of a length, on off stump, and he's back and across in a flash and has all the time in the world to swat this away over the midwicket boundary. That makes it 13 off this over, and 38 off Shankar's four. I guess India will take it, especially since he got the wicket of Short."
199,"Krunal to Handscomb, 1 run tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
200,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 leg bye back of a length, cramping Maxwell with the angle from round the wicket. Worked off the hip into the backward square leg region"
201,"Krunal to Handscomb, 1 run flat, back of a length, angling into leg stump. Punched down to long-on"
202,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run flat length ball on off stump. Goes back almost by rote, and he doesn't have the room to actually punch it where he wants - to long-on. Ends up playing a defensive push into the on side and Krunal cuts off the single"
203,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length again, worked to deep midwicket to bring up his second fifty of the series. Excellent innings"
204,"Krunal to Handscomb, 1 run again, back of a length, stump-to-stump, angled in from wide of the crease, no turn, and forcing the batsman to go leg-side. Clipped away to deep midwicket"
205,"Chahal to Handscomb, no run a couple of steps down the pitch and Chahal fires it a little shorter and wider. Driven to extra-cover"
206,"Chahal to Handscomb, 1 run down the track and this time Chahal bowls it at his pads, flat and quick. Clipped away quietly to deep midwicket"
207,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run flat slider on leg stump. Makes a lot of room and opens his bat face to squeeze a single to the right of backward point"
208,"Chahal to Handscomb, FOUR runs down the track once again comes Handscomb, and that's a lovely crisp hit. Ends up getting one right in his slot for the inside-out chip over wide long-off, hits it well enough to nearly carry all the way"
209,"Chahal to Handscomb, 1 run length ball on middle and off, swept away to the right of deep backward square leg"
210,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length slider on leg stump, makes room to punch to deep extra cover"
211,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run nice change of pace. He usually goes quick, quick, quick, and Maxwell is too early on his slog-sweep, misses and the ball hits him high on the thigh"
212,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 wide wide outside off, back of a length, Maxwell reaches out to cut and misses"
213,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
214,"Krunal to Handscomb, 1 run length ball on off stump, pulled in the air, on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
215,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run flat length ball angling into off stump, and too quick for the reverse-swat. Bit of an lbw shout, but India don't review. May have straightened just enough to miss off stump"
216,"Krunal to Maxwell, SIX runs whoa, that's the biggest hit of this innings. A big front-foot stride to a back-of-a-length ball close to off stump, and he generates incredible power through his hips to wallop that waaay over long-off"
217,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run flat and back of a length again, and Maxwell goes too early into the pull, drags it along the ground to deep backward square leg"
218,"Chahal to Maxwell, 2 runs back of a length on middle and leg, nudged into the vacant midwicket region and they scamper two while the fielder sprints in off the boundary"
219,"Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs full, just outside leg. Was looking to cramp him by attacking his pads, but he's marginally missed his line, and Maxwell gets down on one knee at great speed and swivels through a sweep that easily clears the backward square leg boundary"
220,"Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs Chahal goes to his wide-outside-off line, and Maxwell's response is emphatic, a reverse-sweep off incredible power and bat-speed, whacked over the point boundary. The key was how quickly he created a wide base with his footwork"
221,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run full on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
222,"Chahal to Handscomb, 1 run down the track and Chahal floats a full one outside off. Pushed out to deep extra-cover for one"
223,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run flat, fairly wide outside off. Hurries through to beat Maxwell's attempted cut"
224,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run shortish outside off, jabbed to the left of backward point. Krunal dives, stops it, and throws to the bowler's end. Bumrah is in front of the stumps, he leaves it, the ball misses the stumps, and they sneak an overthrow"
225,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs full, plenty of width, a rare free hit from Bumrah, and you don't bowl those to Maxwell in this mood. Drives it up and over cover, finishing with a high left elbow"
226,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed down to long-off"
227,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run length ball on off stump, opens his bat face and steers it down to third man"
228,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs that's a great shot. Not the most attractive shot he's played, and it's muscled rather than timed, but he's gone so deep in his crease to convert a slightly back-of-a-length slower delivery into a short ball and he swivels to beat the diving square leg fielder"
229,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run very full outside off, Maxwell slices it flat and hard towards deep point"
230,"Kaul to Maxwell, no run short ball just outside off, maybe the knuckle ball, and Maxwell swivels too early into his pull and gets hit on his back"
231,"Kaul to Maxwell, SIX runs dismissive. That's smacked the top corner of the sightscreen, on the full. Length ball outside off, and he just clears his front leg and smacks it through the line"
232,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run in the blockhole on off stump, whipped away to deep square leg"
233,"Kaul to Handscomb, 2 runs yorker just outside off, good use of the hands to steer it to the right of third man"
234,"Kaul to Handscomb, 1 run back of a length slower offcutter heading towards leg stump. Punched down to long-on"
235,"Kaul to Maxwell, (no ball) SIX runs waist-high full-toss. We'll have to check for no-ball here. Yup, it is, but it doesn't matter to Maxwell, who opens up at the hips and simply wallops this over wide long-on. Sensational hitting, moves to 98"
236,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run another full-toss - seemed close to waist height but perhaps just below - outside off. Maxwell flat-bats it on the full to long-off, but this, of course, is a free hit"
237,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run yorker just outside off, jams his bat down and squeezes it past the right of the diving keeper. Off the cue end of the bat, and he'll only get a single, but that's all he needed to bring up his third T20I hundred. First Australian to the mark. What a player."
238,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run length ball outside off, opens his bat face and jabs to backward point"
239,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run off-stump yorker. Gets his front foot out of the way and fashions a one-legged flick to square leg"
240,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run full-toss, about stump high, on middle stump. Punched straight back and it hits the middle stump at the other end"
241,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run another low-ish full-toss. More leg-stumpish this time. Punched to long-on, bat jarring on impact"
242,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run full on off stump, Laxmaned down to long-on"
243,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, slapped to point, can't beat the diving fielder"
244,"Kaul to Handscomb, 1 run ooh. Backward point is right on the edge of the circle, and Handscomb has opened his bat face and squeezed this off-stump yorker straight to the fielder to get off strike"
245,"Kaul to Maxwell, SIX runs make that one off three. What a sensational shot. Attempted yorker misses the length marginally, and the wide-ish full-toss is launched straight back over the bowler's head with an incredible bottom-handed shovel"
246,"Kaul to Maxwell, FOUR runs and there's the win, Australia seal a 2-0 series victory. Back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell makes a bit of room and flat-bats it to the right of extra-cover. He's been simply unstoppable today"
247,"10.26pm A big confidence boost for Australia ahead of the ODIs, and a big statement from Glenn Maxwell ahead of the World Cup. How this man isn't an ever-present in all formats will remain a mystery to me - he's just too good a player. No one in the world has hands like him. A few questions for India - I thought picking the extra batsman in Vijay Shankar was the right call, but did they score enough? Dhawan's contribution at the top will come under some scrut"
248,It's times like these that make for a good behind-the-scenes look at a player. Here's the story of Glenn Maxwell by SB Tang for the Cricket Monthly.
249,"10.45pm And that is that from this T20I series. Come World Cup, you'd think Australia will have assembled a pretty damn formidable 15, regardless of their poor results in the format over the last couple of years. There's still an ODI series to go before that, and it begins on March 2 in Hyderabad. Be sure to join us for that. Until then, it's goodbye from Sreshth, Chandan and me. Good night!"
250,Australia won by 7 wickets (with 2 balls remaining)
251,"Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS"
