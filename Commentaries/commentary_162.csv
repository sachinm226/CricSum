7,"Stoinis to Rahane, 1 run flat-bats this nearly to mid-on. Was dying on him. Risky stroke. This one came onto him faster than he expected, Rahane had to fetch it from outside off as well. Good work by Pat Cummins at mid-on. Just short of him"
8,"Stoinis to Kohli, 2 runs walks into the drive, reaches out and then crashes this on the up towards sweeper cover"
9,"Stoinis to Kohli, 2 runs beautiful balance and placement. Half-volley outside off, Kohli walked into the stroke again and executed a crunching cover drive"

24,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, no run wrists this length ball from off stump to mid-on"

26,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, no run gets outside the line of the stump and dabs this to point"
27,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, no run driven straight back into the stumps at the bowler's end. Richardson didn't get a hand on it, so all good."

29,"Kane Richardson to Rahane, 1 run uses the width to dab this down to third man for an easy single"
30,"Agar to Rahane, no run skids back in from around the stumps, Rahane looks to punch this through midwicket but gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"

36,"Stoinis to Rahane, no run length outside off, punched to cover"
37,"Stoinis to Rahane, 1 wide the bowler doesn't help by bowling a length ball down leg, he dives low to collect it. Wide called. Rahane had an opportunity to tickle it fine"

43,"Agar to Kohli, no run excellent stop off his own bowling. Driven inside-out, dived to his left to cut that off"

46,"Agar to Rahane, no run pushed through quicker on middle, much fuller as well, Rahane turns this to short midwicket"

48,"Agar to Rahane, no run this time he brings out the cut, finds Maxwell at point"
49,"Stoinis to Kohli, FOUR runs just wide of Travis Head at mid-on. Kohli flat-bats this pull from outside off, didn't middle it but it just kept racing away past the fielder. Not where he intended but the result is four runs nonetheless."
50,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run slower length ball outside off, left alone"
51,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run skiddy length ball on off, Kohli is onto his toes as he chops this behind the wicket. Looks for a single nevertheless but Rahane was firm and put his hand out quickly to say 'no'"
52,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run held up on the surface again, around the good length area. Kohli was through with the drive, lobbed off the top part of the bat, just short of cover"
53,"Stoinis to Kohli, 2 runs pulled in front of square, called two immediately and will come back"
54,"Stoinis to Kohli, 2 runs sloppy work in the infield. Good work by the man at third man though, who was around the ropes to back up the throw from midwicket. Kohli dabbed it there and scampered a run, only to get a few more."
55,"Agar to Rahane, 1 run plays outside the line of the in-drifter, rolls off the inside edge to square leg"
56,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run driven with the spin to long-off for an easy single"

58,"Agar to Rahane, 1 run punched past the bowler as they jog the single"
59,"Agar to Kohli, FOUR runs delicate little dab past short third man. Astonishing because this wasn't fired in, so Kohli had to force the pace. He somehow managed to do so. Played it really late"
60,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run clears his front leg to open up the off side and blasts this to wide long-off. Unfurled his wrists to pick the region"

65,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run gets onto his toes and opens the bat face to help this short of length delivery down to third man"
66,"Cummins to Rahane, no run nearly a mix-up. Rahane hit this to mid-off and wanted a single. Was four steps down when he was sent back by Kohli."
67,"Agar to Kohli, no run steers this to short third man, Rahane turns down the single immediately"
68,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run hint of turn from middle and leg, Kohli wrists this to deep midwicket"

70,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run fired into middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket as they jog the single"
71,"Agar to Rahane, 2 wide wrong line. Fires this full and down leg, Rahane looks to paddle and misses. Wade can't stop that cleanly"
72,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run there's a half-century, No.45 in ODIs. Leans forward and works this across the line towards long-on"
73,"Agar to Rahane, 1 run takes it on the full and creams this to deep cover"
74,"Cummins to Rahane, no run check-drives a full ball back to Cummins, who puts his boot out to stop it on his followthrough"
75,"Cummins to Rahane, 1 run just a gentle push off the frontfoot as they hare across. It was a race between Cummins and Kohli. A direct deflect off the left boot to the stumps at the striker's end and Kohli would've been gone"
76,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run whipped uppishly off his hip towards deep midwicket"
77,"Cummins to Rahane, no run gets this length ball to hold up again, Rahane check-drives to cover"
78,"Cummins to Rahane, 1 run slow off-cutter on off, Rahane nudges this wide of square leg to bring up his 20th ODI fifty"
79,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run steers this away-going length ball to square third man"
80,"Head to Kohli, no run fired full on the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
81,"Head to Kohli, 1 run right to the pitch of the ball as he drives to wide long-off"
82,"Head to Rahane, FOUR runs makes room and crashes this short ball to the cover boundary. He had all the time in the world to pick that where he wanted to"
83,"Head to Rahane, 1 run, OUT driven nicely off the frontfoot towards deep cover. Rahane was slow to turn for second and that may have cost him a split-second. He was ambling through the second when he realised the throw was coming to his end. Wade collected the throw cleanly and whipped the bails off to catch Rahane short despite a full-length dive. Credit to Hilton Cartwright as well for the super-flat throw. India lose one against the run of play"
84,"Head to Pandey, no run struck on the pad but outside the line. Went forward and across to defend but this held its line to hit him on the back pad"
85,"Head to Pandey, no run much better, lunges forward and blocks"
86,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, 1 run dabs this length ball down to third man. Bit too close for comfort, Kohli may have got that near the glove"

93,"Head to Pandey, no run flight outside off to start from Head, worked to midwicket with the spin"
94,"Head to Pandey, 1 run a tad shorter, flatter and wider. Pandey defends towards cover and sets off for one, good running from Kohli"
95,"Head to Kohli, no run darted in quick, Head's modus operandi. Nudged to midwicket"
96,"Head to Kohli, 2 runs intentionally opened up his wrists to hit the ball wide of cover. No fielder there and he gets two. AB de Villiers does that very well. Terrific batting"
97,"Head to Kohli, 1 wide quick down leg, wide"
98,"Head to Kohli, no run 86 kph, darted in on leg, clipped to square leg again"
99,"Head to Kohli, 1 run pushed with the spin to long-on for one. Far too easy for Kohli."

102,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run good length outside off, defended down, towards backward point"
103,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run lovely bowling. Goes wide of the crease, and delivers this wide outside off. Pandey belatedly decides to leave"
104,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, 1 run lovely wristwork. Full and straight, drilled back to the stumps at the bowler's end. Kohli has no time to turn back and get his bat back, but there was no hand from NCN"
105,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run early-enough call from Pandey. Full outside off, defended towards point. Kohli sets off but is sent back in time"
106,"Agar to Pandey, no run flight on middle, full, Pandey pushes to cover. Nice line"
107,"Agar to Pandey, OUT goes through. Pandey has struggled against pace this series. That's not a good shot. Hurried for pace again, goes back and looks to cut a straight ball. There is a hint of turn too. Both his feet are in the air as he missed the cut. A nothing shot, an awful shot. The ball clips the top of off. Put himself under pressure with so many dot balls, when he felt he needed a scoring shot, he needed to play it off a good ball"
108,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 wide drifts this down leg for a wide. Not a good start from Agar"
109,"Agar to Jadhav, no run better. Lots of flight on middle and off, driven to cover"
110,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 run skewed off the inside half. Full and straight, driven to mid-on"
111,"Agar to Kohli, no run flat and straight, punched to midwicket from the back foot"
112,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run flat outside off, driven to long-off. Good defensive last ball from Agar, clever thinking to protect the over"
113,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, FOUR runs fabulous batting. Agar may have cut that off in the cold of Nottingham, not here. Full outside off, Kohli runs at the bowler and converts an off-stump delivery into something on his pads. No midwicket there so that's four on this outfield"
114,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run keep it there to Jadhav early in his innings. Digs this in, down leg, pulled to fine leg awkwardly"
115,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, no run full delivery outside off, driven on the up to cover"
116,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run a nice straight drive, half-stop from the bowler. Full outside off, driven back towards the bowler, who gets down. Mid-off fields"
117,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, no run full outside off, Jadhav strides forward to defend"
118,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run the same ball that got Pandey, look at how Kohli has played it. He has stood upright and punched a ball to deep cover, instead of deep point"
119,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 run flat and wide outside off, sliced to the right of short third man"
120,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run on the pads, driven to long-on"
121,"Agar to Jadhav, 2 runs on the pads, nudged to square leg. Smith throws at the bowler's end, Agar doesn't back-up cleanly and allows an overthrow. Sloppy"
122,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 run on the pads again, nudged to short fine leg for one"
123,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run quick and straight, clipped to fine leg. Seven riskless runs. Well played"
124,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run on the pads, clipped down to fine leg. Can't bowl there. Lucky Kane."
125,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run another neat clip down to fine leg for one. Got to shift that line a set of stumps wider outside off"
126,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs more runs. Agar cuts this one off. Short on middle and off, sits up for Kohli to slap through midwicket for a couple."
127,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run full and wide, crashed through to the sweeper cover for a run. Kohli calls for a drink, I've never seen him so fatigued in an innings"
128,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, no run back of a length on middle and leg, defended back. A good ball, well played"
129,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 wide wide! Short delivery that flies over Jadhav's head"
130,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, no run full delivery outside off, driven to cover."
131,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run short and wide outside off, slashed to the sweeper cover"
132,"Agar to Jadhav, no run on the pads, clipped down to fine leg. Kohli calls no, his call, good call"
133,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 run nicely bowled. Some loop and flight outside off, pushed away towards cover"
134,"Agar to Kohli, no run quick and straight, pushed towards point. Jadhav says no this time"
135,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run excellent bowling, just a hint of turn in this surface. Flight outside off, defended in the gap at extra cover for one"
136,"Agar to Jadhav, 1 run 85 kph, flat and full, driven to long-on off the inside half. Had to wait for the ball to beat midwicket"
137,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run good length outside off, may have been the offcutter, patted to backward point."
138,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run 131 kph, length outside off, fifth-stump line, defended to point."
139,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run three dot balls. Short and straight, slapped to midwicket. Not the length to pull. Now what?"
140,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 wide 130 kph, short and very wide outside off, not a bad option but far too much width. The ball beats Jadhav's cut, wide called"
141,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 bye Kohli steals a bye. Wade is in the wars. A slower delivery outside off, bounces in front of Wade and hits him somewhere near the groin. Wade can't move. Kohli realises that and gets one, sensational game awareness. The ball was by his feet"
142,"Stoinis to Kohli, FOUR runs saves Jadhav and capitalises. Full and wide outside off, sliced past backward point for four. All timing from Kohli. He's in control"
143,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run good length outside off, dabbed to third man"
144,"Agar to Kohli, 2 runs flight on middle and leg, whipped wide of midwicket for a couple."
145,"Agar to Kohli, no run flat down leg, Kohli misses a sweep, struck on the pad"
146,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run flight outside off, drilled to long-off with a whippy action"
147,"Agar to Jadhav, no run flat and wide outside off, guided to third man"
148,"Agar to Jadhav, FOUR runs superb stroke. Flight outside off, a bit too much flight, Jadhav gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover. Once it beats the fielder, just admire your shot"
149,"Agar to Jadhav, FOUR runs the fine paddle sweep. Sensational hand speed through the ball. Flat down leg, Jadhav switches from an orthodox sweep to a powerful paddle sweep on the ground seeing the pace on the ball. Fine leg watches it go by"
150,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run good length outside off, watches the ball onto his bat and then deflects it down to third man"
151,"Stoinis to Jadhav, SIX runs don't give him width. It's short, it's wide, it's an invitation and Jadhav accepts. He gets underneath the length intentionally and carves a cut over backward point for six"
152,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run good length outside off, Jadhav tries to work through square leg, like how Amla does, but can only tap it back"
153,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 run good length on off, worked towards square leg for one. Nicely played"
154,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run a slower delivery dug in outside off, dug it in, good length to bowl, guided to point"
155,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run a short slower offcutter outside off, third man is in play again as Kohli guides one down"
156,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run fullish delivery outside off, driven to backward point. This game just waiting to be broken open"
157,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, 1 run good length delivery on off, Kohli brings his wrists into play and guides this through square leg"
158,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, OUT and gone. Jadhav tries to get underneath and cut again but it was too full for that. He may have been better off trying to play that down, instead he brought his bat from down to up, which means the ball will only go up. The full length means there isn't enough elevation and Maxwell, at backward point, gobbles it up."
159,"Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, no run excellent first delivery. A short well-directed bouncer on leg, Dhoni bails out of a pull very late"
160,"Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, FOUR runs he has pulled that, and he has absolutely nailed it. Short down leg, not high enough. Unlike Jadhav, Dhoni brings his bat from up to down, keeping it all along the ground. Finds the gap at backward square leg with nonchalant ease."
161,"Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, no run fullish delivery outside off, played to point"
162,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run full on off, whipped to midwicket"
163,"Stoinis to Kohli, FOUR runs wow, I've not seen many better shots. This was full, yes, but that wasn't nearly wide enough. He still manages to create an angle with his cover drive. His placement is exemplary, timing when is it not? Four."
164,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run shortish outside off, pulled to midwicket. Not timed as well as he would have liked"
165,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run shortish outside off, guided down to third man for one"
166,"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run short outside off, the ball is just inside the tramline. Dhoni leaves, anticipating a wide. The umpire ain't fooled"
167,"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run shortish outside off, patted down to point. Tidy over from Stoinis"
168,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run bunted to midwicket. Good length on middle and leg, a clip finds midwicket"
169,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run full and straight, worked to point. Kohli wants one, Dhoni coolly sends him back. No run there"
170,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run good bowling this. A short slow delivery well outside off, Kohli wants to drag a pull but misses. A cry of anguish. Dhoni has a chat with Kohli"
171,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, 2 runs good stuff from Cummins at deep square leg. On Kohli's pads, why?, worked through midwicket for a couple."
172,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, OUT and chopped on! Kohli falls for 92. The ball has been seaming back in, Kohli chooses the wrong option of playing a dab down to third man, the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. Maybe his first mistake of the day. Fantastic innings anyway"
173,"Coulter-Nile to Hardik, FOUR runs a thick inside edge that just evades the stumps. Phew, that was close! Full and straight, moving back in, Pandya defends and the ball moves back. Four to fine leg"
174,"Coulter-Nile to Hardik, 1 run short outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover. This is NCN's last over"
175,"Coulter-Nile to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs the wild swing, aimed to go over long-on, but Bhuvneshwar will take it, the ball has gone a 180 degrees wide of where he intended, to third man for four off the edge"
176,"Coulter-Nile to Bhuvneshwar, no run whaaat happened there? Good length outside off, slower ball. Bhuvneshwar wants to pull, then thinks of cutting, then tries to take the bat away, but the ball hits the leading edge, lobs up and in front of point"
177,"Coulter-Nile to Bhuvneshwar, no run yikes! Bhuvneshwar has nailed his drive right back at Pandya. Friendly fire! The Australian fielders are concerned, they go to Pandya to check on his wellbeing. Ouch. Hit him on the helmet, hit so hard that Pandya had no time to get out of the way. A painful blow but he's fine to go."
178,"Coulter-Nile to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide tennis-ball bounce. Short on middle and off, Bhuvneshwar misses an upper cut. Way over the head. Wide"
179,"Coulter-Nile to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run full and straight, the ball moves back in, a skewed heave finds long-on. The ball is always going to go to the leg side"
180,"Coulter-Nile to Hardik, no run short on middle and leg to finish. Pandya makes room but misses his cut. Good option, but can't execute. Fantastic spell from NCN ends"
181,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 2 runs full and wide outside off, a mis-timed drive to the sweeper cover for a couple."
182,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run a good slower ball, dipping full toss outside off, sliced to the keeper. Deceived Bhuvneshwar"
183,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run another slower ball outside off, played away to point for one"
184,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, (no ball) a high full toss outside off, Pandya skews his heave but can only find Smith at cover. Smith wants the run-out too, he throws the ball back to the bowler and Richardson takes off the bails with Pandya nowhere in sight. Looks like it is over waist, and that should be a no-ball. It is. There is a free hit, but no cricket as the players run off. Chaos. Smith has a chat with the umpires about it. Australia definitely completed the run-out as"
185,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run a legcutter outside off, a thick under edge to the keeper"
186,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 2 runs full on off, somehow Bhuvneshwar gets so much elevation as he gets underneath the length. Smith runs back and to his left from cover, gets underneath it, and spills the chance. His body almost balancing on the side of his head."
187,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, OUT gone this time. Full around off and middle, Bhuvneshwar gets underneath again and hits the ball straight up. Maxwell runs in from long-on and completes the catch. Too early through the ball, may have been some pace off the ball from Richardson"
188,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run full outside off, pushed to cover"
189,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run full outside off, another defensive stroke to cover"
190,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run a back of a length delivery outside off, blocked again. Dhoni forced into caution"
191,"Cummins to Dhoni, 1 run on a length on middle and off, worked to square leg. Agar has hurt something, it may be cramp. Struggled to get that back. The physio runs out"
192,"Cummins to Hardik, no run good length delivery outside off, carved down towards gully"
193,"Cummins to Hardik, 2 runs good length delivery on off, inside-edged towards square leg. Pandya scampers back for two, terrific running"
194,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, OUT an absolutely humongous wicket, not just because of who it is, but also because that could make a 25-run difference to the total. Full outside off, may have come off the surface slower than usual, and Dhoni drives too early. The ball goes up and Smith dives forward to take a good catch."
195,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run full outside off, driven to the sweeper cover"
196,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, no run another good length delivery around off, may have been the offcutter, Pandya is watchful in defense"
197,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, 1 run edged and just wide of slip. Good length outside off, a thick outside edge runs down to third man"
198,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run well bowled. Another slower ball outside off, Bhuvneshwar plays the line but the legcutter may have cut enough to beat the bat"
199,"Kane Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run another full delivery outside off, Bhuvneshwar prods, a thick outside edge finds third man"
200,"Cummins to Kuldeep, no run good length outside off, jags away and beats Kuldeep. There's some carry"
201,"Cummins to Kuldeep, OUT oh yes. Wade will feel a lot better now, mentally at least. Full and wide outside off, Kuldeep wafts with his weight firmly on the back foot. Gets a thick outside edge that flies towards Wade, who wanted to go with both hands, but improvised midway through knowing that he can't get there. So he stuck out his left hand, behind his back and hung on. One of the better catches you'll see"
202,"Cummins to Bumrah, no run good length on middle and leg, dabbed back up the pitch. Cummins runs to the ball to prevent a run"
203,"Cummins to Bumrah, 1 wide a wide. A short slower bouncer that's well over Bumrah's head. Why the slower bouncer? The right length but could have used the pace"
204,"Cummins to Bumrah, FOUR runs weeee, a slog that is intended to go over midwicket but the thick outside edge races down to the third man boundary. Third man should be fine for tail-enders but not sure even he would have got around"
205,"Cummins to Bumrah, 1 run full and wide, guided to third man"
206,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 run good length outside off, dabbed to third man for one. He'll keep strike"
207,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, OUT smashed! But straight down to long-off. A slower full toss outside off, and intentionally bowled that wide outside off. Pandya hits it decently but not well enough. Finds Warner"
208,"Kane Richardson to Chahal, 1 run another slow full toss on off, dabbed to cover for one. Bat on ball, par for the course now"
209,"Kane Richardson to Bumrah, no run another slower ball outside off, Bumrah's big swing travels only as far as the bowler"
210,"Kane Richardson to Bumrah, FOUR runs another boundary. Bumrah's cameo lifts India past 250. Another slower ball outside off, the heave trickles into the boundary at square leg. The fielder was up."
211,"Kane Richardson to Bumrah, 1 run a legcutter outside off, far and wide, dabbed to backward point for a run."
212,"Kane Richardson to Chahal, OUT run-out! And India are all out. A short and wide slower ball that is very wide outside off, Chahal can't connect, he runs down before Bumrah sends him back. Wade runs up and hits the stumps directly."
213,"Ajinkya Rahane: We were looking to get 260-270, but 250 is decent. I knew if I take my time, I could play my shots. We wanted to disrupt their plans. We were looking to get 290, in between was not easy to rotate the strike, wicket was two paced. Really challenging conditions."
214,"5.43pm This isn't exactly what India would have wanted, a score of 252. But this is not a batting surface, it's slow and two-paced. Australia will definitely take that, especially when Kohli and Rahane were going so well. But Kohli's wicket, after a typically fluent 92, slowed down India to the point where all they could aim for was close to 270. They fell short of that too. Australia, despite their batting struggles, will fancy their chances in this game. Shashank will be back with"
215,"6.10pm Welcome back. We're about to resume, but as Kohli gives a pep talk to his team, here's a completely new ball game. You can read about Ronaldinho, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes playing futsal in Bengaluru. One of them scored a hat-trick and Debayan Sen was there"
216,Hilton Cartwright opens with David Warner. He failed on ODI debut but has an opportunity to make amends. Bhuvneshwar with the new ball for India. Two slips in place
217,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, no run hint of movement in the air, full and just outside off, left alone"
218,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, no run gets this length ball to go the other way - nip back in - and hit him high on the box as he plays all around it. Ouch"
219,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, no run minimal feet movement as he bunts this length ball on off with soft hands"
220,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, 1 run tucks this to Chahal at square leg as they scamper through. Warner wasn't sure of the run but trusted his mate. Even a direct hit wouldn't have been enough here"
221,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run gets this length ball to nip away from outside off, Warner lets it go. Zips to Dhoni"
222,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run gets one to come back in off the seam, Warner hops back and defends back down the pitch. Excellent start from Bhuvi"

224,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run hops back and across as he turns this short of length delivery on middle and leg to square leg"
225,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run floats a full-length delivery on off, Cartwright is well forward as he bunts this to the off side"
226,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run beaten. Looked to punch on the up but this one nipped away to beat the batsman comprehensively. Played for the one that comes in."

233,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, no run comes closer to the stumps and delivers a full delivery that moves away off the seam from off stump, watched through to Dhoni"
234,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, OUT this is almost like how he got Hafeez on his T20I debut. String of dot balls may have played on Cartwright's mind. This is a good length delivery just around off, Cartwright isn't sure if this one's going away or coming in. Pokes at the delivery without any conviction and sees the ball beat the inside edge and crash into the stumps. Bhuvneshwar's foot was very close to the line, but Cartwright has been told he can continue walking."
235,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run punches this skiddy length ball to deep poin"
236,"Bumrah to Smith, 2 runs shuffles across and whips this short of length ball off his hip towards deep square"

238,"Bumrah to Smith, no run alarming movement just as it passes the batsman. Dug in at length just outside off, Smith let that go"

243,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run banana swing from Bhuvi, gets this to move away in the air and little more after it pitches, left alone"
244,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run full and swinging away from off stump, there's an open invitation to drive if Warner really wants to have a go at that, he leaves again"
245,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, 1 leg bye this one's full and comes back in to hit Head on the pad, they take a run off the deflection. There was a stifled appeal but this pitched way outside leg"
246,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR runs flies past leg stump. Oooh! How lucky is Head? Pokes at an away-going length ball, got a thick inside edge. On another day, he would've chopped on"
247,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR runs width and he's thumped this to the point boundary. Too short, this was sitting up nicely as Head used the width to put that away"
248,"Bumrah to Head, no run angles a length ball across the left-hander, left alone"
249,"Bumrah to Head, 3 runs looks to force this through mid-on, gets the inner half of the bat to beat square leg. Chahal hares across and then dishes in a dive to pull it back in near the deep square boundary"
250,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run squeezed away towards square third man"
251,"Bumrah to Head, no run chases an away-going delivery and is beaten. No feet movement, just threw his bat out to hit that on the up, but couldn't reach out"

254,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, no run full and in the driving zone outside off, Head is happy to leave"
255,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, no run forces one off a thick inside edge to midwicket. Was deep inside the crease in his attempt to play late at a delivery angling away"
256,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, FOUR runs lovely roll of the wrists as he whips this length ball on middle and leg to the square leg boundary. Easily done"
257,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, no run dropped! Pokes at an away-going delivery, this flew low to Rohit who was late to move low down to complete that catch at first slip. Oh, dear. Was a healthy edge, it looked like Rohit moved late. And while he managed to get into position, a split-second late resulted in the catch going down. Hit his palm and went down"

259,"Bumrah to Smith, no run full and just around off, defended from the crease"
260,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs full and just outside off, Smith shuffles across and shovels this away into the midwicket boundary"

264,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, no run looked to smash the leather off the ball, couldn't get any bat on this short ball. There was enough width as well"

266,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, no run play and a miss again. Gets this length ball to angle away from wide of the crease"

271,"Hardik to Head, no run right onto the backfoot as he blocks"
272,"Hardik to Head, FOUR runs this is a poor ball, it went to the midwicket boundary even before Pandya could complete his followthrough. Too short, Head got into position quickly and hammered that away"
273,"Hardik to Head, 3 runs not all that full but Head leans into the drive and executes this superbly into the gap. Rahane sprints towards the cover boundary and parries it back to Pandey, who in-turn relays it to the keeper. Good work, all of it to save one run."

282,"Hardik to Smith, no run on the move as he tries to drive on the up, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
283,"Hardik to Smith, FOUR runs this is simply sublime from Smith. This is a touch ahead of length, not much movement in the air, Smith moves across and simply hits that through the line to beat cover"
284,"Hardik to Smith, no run banged in short, just around off, Smith is squared up as he defends awkwardly"
285,"Hardik to Smith, FOUR runs drilled down past mid-on. They've decided to play shots and at the moment, they're all authentic. Pressure back on India"

287,"Hardik to Smith, 4 leg byes deflects off the pad to the third man boundary. Played outside the line of this length ball as he shuffled across, enough pace on Pandya's deliveries for this to run away. Runs leaking for India"

295,"Hardik to Head, no run driven firmly but straight to Kohli at extra cover"
296,"Hardik to Head, FOUR runs too straight. Length ball on middle and leg and he's flicked that away past Bumrah at mid-on. Lovely use of the wrists to pick the gap. Mind you, the weight wasn't fully forward, so this was all the more astonishing. It's flying off his blade at the moment. Pandya is struggling"
297,"Hardik to Head, 1 run crunched on the up to sweeper cover"
298,"Hardik to Smith, 2 runs shuffles across Smith style and whips this towards Chahal at deep square. It raced away faster than he expected"

305,"Chahal to Head, 1 run touch short, spins back into middle and leg, worked to deep square as they jog the single"
306,"Kuldeep to Head, no run looks to work across the line and is hit on the pad. This was the wrong'un which may have gone on to hit the stumps, but impact was outside off."

308,"Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs worked with the spin into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square"
309,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run wrists this from middle and off towards deep midwicket"
310,"Kuldeep to Head, no run looks to flick but nearly yorked himself, squeezed to the leg side"
311,"Kuldeep to Head, no run slow turn from off stump, too short to trouble anyone. Punched to Pandey at cover"
312,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run slow turn from off stump, eased to point. Kedar was late to move forward towards the ball. Dhoni isn't happy with the effort."

330,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run drilled back to the bowler, too full this time from Kuldeep. Good stop off his own bowling"

332,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs he bowls this just a touch quicker, perhaps as a result of the previous delivery, but it makes no difference. This is also on leg stump, he's down on one knee as he sweeps this behind sqyuare."
333,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run sweeps and misses, this was the googly. He shortened his length as well. Pitched outside leg though"
334,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run chops this cut to cover"
335,"Chahal to Smith, no run appeal for caught behind but there's no bat on it. Smith looks to tickle this in-drifter. Smith is amused, didn't hit anything. Don't normally see Dhoni appeal unless he's supremely confident, but this time he too was wrong"
336,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run eased with the spin to long-off as they jog the single"
337,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 wide tosses this up outside off to beat Maxwell in flight as he looks to slap this away. Harsh call from the umpire, who thought this was way outside off"

342,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run skiddy bouncer on middle, Maxwell is right inside the crease as he blocks"

351,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run sharp turn from off stump, shortened his length just a touch, bunted to Jadhav at point"
352,"Chahal to Maxwell, OUT there's the magic ball. Dhoni isn't generally pumped up but boy, is he animated or what? Outstanding work by Chahal. Tossed it up but slowed it down nicely, he saw Maxwell charge down so lobbed this towards middle and leg, Maxwell, who senses he may not have gotten to the pitch of the ball, looks to turn this to the leg side, but the ball deflects off his right pad as the ball went between his legs, Dhoni collects it and smashes the stumps to leave Maxw"
353,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run drifts in and spin away to whizz past the outside edge. Nervous poke from Stoinis,feet went nowhere"

356,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run slow turn from off stump, touch short as well, punched to long-off"
357,"Kuldeep to Smith, FOUR runs too full, too much width and he's crashed that to the cover boundary. Cry of anguish from Dhoni, as if to say 'that's not the line I asked you to bowl.' This was right in his hitting arc"
358,"Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs too short this time, tucked away towards Chahal at fine leg. Risky second but the throw wasn't the greatest"

373,"Hardik to Smith, no run full and straight, 134 kph, driven on the up to mid-on"
374,"Hardik to Smith, no run good length outside off, somehow gets the ball to move away juuuust a touch. Enough at this level though. Awkwardly defended"

376,"Hardik to Smith, no run good length on off, Smith watches the ball onto his bat as he defends"
377,"Hardik to Smith, FOUR runs raaaces away. You have to finish your over well. Drifts down leg and that's Smith's meat and drink as he flicks down to fine leg. Easy. Stayed patient, got the bad ball and put it away. Fabulous batting"

383,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run full and straight, defended"

391,"Hardik to Smith, no run another slower ball outside off, driven to cover"
392,"Hardik to Smith, OUT Jadeja takes the catch, it's a huge wicket for India, so much so that it makes them clear favourites now. Pandya uses this delivery very well, the hard-length bouncer, on middle and leg. Climbs steeply on Smith who can't quite keep his pull down. Jadeja misjudges it, but runs in from deep square leg and takes the routine catch. It was set for Smith, but he's been done in. Hurried for pace and a little extra bounce too"

418,"Kuldeep to Coulter-Nile, no run the googly outside off, Coulter-Nile leaves confidently"
419,"Kuldeep to Coulter-Nile, 3 runs the top edge. Flat on middle and leg, looks for the big sweep, gets a thick edge which flies past slip. Chahal at third man runs it down rapidly"

421,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run 78 kph, the stock ball on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"

425,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run full outside off, Stoinis defends"
426,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs just short of Jadeja at deep square leg. How did he get so close? Short on middle and leg, pulled away in the air towards square leg, where Jadeja runs in to his right, dives full-length forward and almost completes a stunner"

428,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run full and wide, drilled to the sweeper cover"
429,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs nicely played, gets low down to sweep and executes a neat paddle sweep. Bumrah dives but can only help it into the boundary in rather awkward fashion"

444,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run driven towards extra cover, Stoinis is sent back belatedly and has to make a dive for it. Kohli's throw is quick to Dhoni, who deflects the ball into the stumps. There's no other combination in world cricket that could have made this doubtful, but Stoinis' bat is just in. He used the back of the bat in contact with the ground"

454,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run IPL skills in play, the flat trajectory, straight line and good length. Defend is all Stoinis can do"

472,"9.33pm India have defended 252 with ease that is not easy to find in modern-day cricket. It wasn't a bad surface to bat on, which makes this loss even harder to take for Australia. They just struggled against wristspin again, and have fallen to a 50-run loss in game 2. They'll now have to win all the three remaining ODIs to win the series. Steven Smith and Marcus Stoinis showed that you can bat well on this surface, but the rest did not do much. Kuldeep Yadav took a hat-trick and pu"
