229,"Powell to Hussey, no run back of a good length outside off stump, Hussey reaches for it and drives into the covers"
230,"Samuels to Hayden, 1 run there it is! Second hundred of the tournament for Hayden!

Superb effort, remember he took some 19 deliveries to get off the mark, and he's gotten here with a strikerate in the 90s. Great knock from Haydos."

254,"Collymore to Watson, no run slower ball, on a yorker length just outside off stump and Watson is beaten on the drive"
255,"Bravo to Hayden, OUT full in the zone, no room to work with, and Hayden scoops this in the air straight down the throat of Samuels at long-off, and an excellent innings comes to an end"
256,"Bravo to Watson, no run slower ball again, outside off stump, Watson looks for that cheeky paddle around the corner as he moves across to off, but cant pull it off"
257,"Bravo to Watson, no run well bowled! Slower one just outside off stump deceives Watson, that was so close to off stump"
258,"Bravo to Watson, 1 run overpitched outside off stump, Watson drives along the ground of mid-off"

263,"Powell to Hayden, 1 run fuller one in the blockhole, Hayden flicks across the stumps for one to square leg"

284,"Bravo to Hogg, 1 bye slower one again, just outside off stump, Hogg goes down as he heaves across the line, misses and Watson calls for the run, a direct hit comes in but he's safely home"
285,"Bravo to Watson, FOUR runs and he ends off in style! Bravo goes wide with the slower ball, Watson hangs on it and drives on the up between cover and point, and thats four to take Australia to 322 for six!"
286,We will have a shortened lunch break due to the overs lost in the rain interval. Dont go anywhere. We'll be back shortly for the second innings.
287,"Riding on Matthew Hayden's excellent hundred, Australia have posted a big total, their fourth in a row in excess of 300 in the tournament. A great effort. Ponting, Clarke and Watson chipped in with cameos and West Indies have a tough ask ahead of them. This brand new surface has been ideal for batting, and there are some clean strikers of the ball to come."
288,Please do have a look at our guide to the Super Eights. It will help clarify alot of the questions that are coming in.
289,"13:59 local, 17:59 GMT The rain has returned, and the waiting game begins. Watch this space for further updates. I cannot give you an idea as to how long play will be suspended. Its a drizzle."
290,"14:33 local, 18:33 GMT Theres no let-up. The covers remain on the square. Players still inside."
291,See what free time can do to a man? Can we get the game going please...
292,"Just for umpire to give whistle"""
293,Still a generous crowd waiting
294,But there is so much water on the covers
295,Its barely even a drizzle
296,"""Its really a crapy mizzle"
297,"As we kill time, here's a little ditty from one of our readers, Omair Shamim, who picked up on - nay, was inspired by - Andrew's update:"
298,"Definitely not good news for the fans out there right now. That means, probably, that if there's no play today, West Indies will still chase 323 with a full 50 overs tomorrow. And thats only if a calculation has been made that they stick to that."
299,"15:34 local, 19:34 GMT Andrew and his posse at the ground reckon the latest restart has to be 4.25pm local, for a 20-over slog. Interesting."
300,"Let me remind you that you can now watch an animated representation of our commentary on Cricinfo 3D. It uses all our scoring data to render a 3d representation of the game, with various camera angles for you to play around with, and it has features such as wagon wheels, pitch maps, and the live scorecard. There are also replays after every wicket and boundary on"
301,Did Omair's poetry have anything to do with this?
302,"15:41 local, 19:41 GMT Whats this? The covers are coming off...will they have a go at this? A little smashathon? I'll feed you details as they come in..."
303,"15:45 local, 19:45 GMT Okay, I have news for all of you. The target, for West Indies, has been set as 163 from 20 overs. Hmmm...the only question remains the start time. Thats not been confirmed. I doubt they'll get 20 overs in. The Aussies are on the outfield getting ready, so something is happening..."
304,"15:53 local, 19:53 GMT Bad news, the drizzle is back and the covers are going back on. That should be that for the day. Just 32 minutes till the cut-off time."
305,"16:01 local, 20:01 GMT Play has been postponed until tomorrow. The target for West Indies will indeed be 323 from 50 overs. Thats because Australia played out a full 50 overs."
306,"So thats all for today, folks. I shall be back with the action for you tomorrow at 13:30 GMT. Until then, good night/evening/afternoon/morning to all of you who've logged on, wherever you may be. Cheers!"
307,Rain delays play. Stumps
308,"Right, chaps. Thanks to all the UK readers who've written to say the GMT time is wrong. Actually, it's right - we're now on BST (British Summer Time) which is a different thing. 14.20BST is 13.20GMT. As you were."
309,"Here come Australia, jogging out into the middle under a pleasingly cloud-free sky. We're in for a cracker here today. Just waiting for the two West Indian openers now..."
310,"Chanderpaul and Gayle stroll, casually, out into the middle. No rush. Smallish crowd so far, just a sprinkling around the ground, but it will no doubt fill up quickly...and very quickly if (Chris) Gayle Force blows in."
311,"Bracken to open the bowling around the wicket, and he seems to have a very effeminate hair band on."
312,"Bracken to Gayle, 1 wide better, but too wide of the off stump to trouble the left hander who watches it swing past him"
313,"Bracken to Gayle, no run and a poor start from Bracken, firing this down the leg side. West Indies are off the mark"
314,"Bracken to Gayle, no run ooh, there we go, angling into Gayle before it swings away from him. Gayle came forward, quite tentatively, but his firm forward defence was soundly beaten"
315,"Bracken to Gayle, no run oh well bowled, that's a boomeranging outswinger from Bracken. Immense lift, off a good length, too"
316,"Bracken to Gayle, no run tighter line, but again there is prodigious outswing for Bracken. Gayle is wise to it now, and shoulders arms"
317,"Bracken to Gayle, no run left alone outside off - a little too wide of the off stump to trouble Gayle"
318,"Bracken to Gayle, no run well, I think Bracken can count himself lucky that wasn't called a wide. Left alone outside off"
319,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide and, as with Bracken, Tait's first ball is flung down the leg side"
320,"Tait to Chanderpaul, no run clipped off his legs but Hussey fields at midwicket like a Jack Russell, scampering to his left"
321,"Tait to Chanderpaul, no run good line this from Tait, rising up on Chanderpaul's off stump and he goes back and across to defend off the back foot"
322,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide a full-bunger down the leg side rightly called a wide"
323,"Tait to Chanderpaul, no run on off stump, left alone"
324,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide oh dear. This is even wider of the leg stump. A comprehensive wide, if there is such a thing, swinging wider still"
325,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 run a touch straighter - full, fast on leg stump - and Chanderpaul clips it off his toes down to fine leg"
326,"Tait to Gayle, no run very well bowled this time, on middle-and-off and Gayle has to jab down on it quickly - his crab-like stance rather suggesting the ball kept a little low"
327,"Tait to Gayle, no run clipped off his toes straight to midwicket"
328,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, no run very wide of the off stump - I'd have called it. But then that's why I'm typing about the cricket and not officiating. Left alone by the batsman"
329,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, 2 runs lovely drive, waiting on the back foot before driving it calmly through cover"
330,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, no run that's close, coming back into Chanderpaul who is rapped on the pads. Replays suggest I'm completely wrong, it wasn't that close, and was rising over his stumps. In fact, it pitched outside off too"
331,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, no run squidged out into the covers off the back foot"
332,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, no run driven with more of a flourish and an extended follow-through, but it clunks off the bat without timing to mid-off"
333,"Bracken to Chanderpaul, no run swinging into Chanderpaul who is again rapped on the pads, beaten by the swing, but no cause for an appeal there"
334,"Tait to Gayle, no run that's zipped past Gayle's throat, albeit wide of his off stump...but an encouraging sign from Tait, getting good bounce off a length"
335,"Tait to Gayle, no run there's the line, on middle-and-off and swinging into Gayle who is really hurried into a defensive poke"
336,"Tait to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging into him and Gayle is finally off the mark with a squirted drive past the bowler"
337,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 2 runs oh and Chanderpaul goes on the pull here - too full to be pulling, perhaps? - gets it off the toe of the bat and it spoons in the air over the bowler. Very fortunate not to find mid-on"
338,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide quick. Quick ball, 91mph (146ish kph) outside off. Chanderpaul goes for a Caribbean slash, but misses it by miles"
339,"Tait to Sarwan, 1 run the wrong line, drifting down leg and Sarwan nudges it to leg to steal the strike"
340,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run pushed out into the off side off the back foot"
341,"Bracken to Sarwan, 1 run ah, fine bowling from Bracken, pitching this up just a touch. It swings into Sarwan who, to his credit, plays it late off the back foot, angling it past gully"
342,"Bracken to Gayle, no run the day's first solid forward defence from Gayle. Nicely behind it, head right over the ball"
343,"Bracken to Gayle, no run firmly blocked out on the front foot once more"
344,"Bracken to Gayle, no run check-driven to mid-off. No chance of a run there. Australia's fielders are positively buzzing at the moment."
345,"Tait to Sarwan, 2 runs on leg stump and, with strong wrist action, he whips it through midwicket"
346,"Tait to Sarwan, no run a nasty riser from Tait. That was a heavy, fast ball really spitting up on Sarwan who fends it off his chest"
347,"Tait to Sarwan, no run crunched to Ponting's right at mid-off but he dives, and saves"
348,"Tait to Sarwan, no run clever, intelligent bowling, sending this wider of Sarwan to tempt him - and he is tempted, going for a huge flay outside off. And misses."
349,"Tait to Sarwan, no run quicker still (92mph. 148kph) but Sarwan is up on his toes, cutting to point. But straight to point"
350,"Tait to Sarwan, no run neatly clipped off his toes, if not as well timed as he'd like, straight to midwicket"
351,"Bracken to Gayle, no run left alone outside off. Bracken continues with this annoyingly wide line of the off stump"
352,"Bracken to Gayle, no run better. Cutting back into Gayle who is solidly behind it"
353,"Bracken to Gayle, no run pushed out with a greater flourish into the covers, but still no run"
354,"Bracken to Gayle, no run check-driven on the front foot to mid-off"
355,"Bracken to Gayle, no run good line, and full too, Gayle defends it off the back foot"
356,"Bracken to Gayle, 1 run too straight, Gayle works it off his legs to fine leg"
357,"McGrath to Gayle, no run inevitably it's pitches on a length, cutting back into Gayle"
358,"McGrath to Samuels, no run back and across, defending this solidly"
359,"McGrath to Samuels, no run what a ball from McGrath. That spat up at Samuels viciously who took his eye off the ball which struck him just below the grill"
360,"McGrath to Samuels, no run ah, lovely flourishing drive but straight to cover"
361,"McGrath to Samuels, no run classic McGrath line-and-length"
362,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run on leg stump - again it keeps low - and it's prodded off the back foot"
363,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run ooh, cuts this into Sarwan who is late on it, defending it off the back foot"
364,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run straighter this time, of driveable length, and Sarwan cracks it to mid-off on the up"
365,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run prodded off the back foot to cover"
366,"Bracken to Sarwan, no run cracked to cover. But straight cover"
367,"McGrath to Samuels, FOUR runs shot. Cover driven with elegance, authority, through cover"
368,"McGrath to Samuels, no run cuts back into him and he jabs down on it late"
369,"McGrath to Samuels, no run driven on the up, but straight to cover"
370,"McGrath to Sarwan, no run left alone outside off"
371,"McGrath to Sarwan, no run and it's firmly defended on the back foot"
372,"Bracken to Lara, no run that one's darted down the off side, on a good length, and the batsman takes his arms and shoulders them"
373,"Bracken to Lara, no run jabs quickly down on to this one, straighter, in line with off, and rising, so he plays off the back foot"
374,"Bracken to Lara, no run even straighter, bang on middle, and Lara shapes to work that one into the midwicket, quick hands as ever, but stops on the shot"
375,"Bracken to Lara, no run great channeling from Bracken, on off this time, right up there and again Lara is made to defend"
376,"Bracken to Lara, no run outside off and Lara can leave that one easily enough. So he does"
377,"Bracken to Lara, 1 run off the mark at last with a tickle to midwicket"
378,"McGrath to Lara, no run stays over the wicket to the lefthander, by the way, and Lara jabs that one down off the back foot"
379,"McGrath to Lara, no run even a mere push of a drive to mid-off, as with this one here, is sumptuous to watch. McGrath bends his back, gets a fingertip to it, and does enough to take the pace off the ball"
380,"McGrath to Lara, no run oozes that one into the short midwicket this time"
381,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run short and that's played down and round behind square"
382,"McGrath to Sarwan, no run defended down off the back foot"
383,"McGrath to Sarwan, no run driven slowly to mid off"
384,"Watson to Lara, no run short, on off, and that's jabbed down off the back foot into the covers"
385,"Watson to Lara, no run short and that's tickled into midwicket off the back foot, the batsman leaving his crease, but getting back quickly as he realises there's no run on"
386,"Watson to Lara, 1 run they look for a quick single off an inside edge and there's a direct hit but Umpire Rauf's into his position quickly and saw that the batsman was well in. The Aussies half-heartedly appealed, there, but Lara was so safely home he was up the stairs tucked up in his pyjamas"
387,"Watson to Sarwan, no run jabbed down off the back foot"
388,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run played out to point"
389,"Watson to Lara, 1 run worked out to a very wide fine leg"
390,"McGrath to Lara, no run dances down, stops, and stuns the ball on the front foot, playing defensively down into the track"
391,"McGrath to Lara, no run pushes that one across the lefthanded Lara, a touch of room and it rises"
392,"McGrath to Lara, no run across him again, a little bit straighter, and Lara is forced to defend yet again"
393,"McGrath to Lara, no run very straight, and that's defended right down"
394,"McGrath to Lara, 3 runs ...until now, dragging that a touch short and that's wristed from outside off stump in front of midwicket, Watson gives chase and hunts it down inside the boundary"
395,"McGrath to Sarwan, 3 runs way too much width, trying to adjust to the righthander, but there's a good double act from Watson and Symonds on the cover boundary and that's relayed back"
396,"Watson to Sarwan, no run short, and Sarwan latches on to it, sending it only as far as point. I can't relay what Sarwan said, this being before the watershed, but let's just say his language was a touch industrial, frustrated at missing out"
397,"Watson to Sarwan, 2 runs pushed in front of midwicket"
398,"Watson to Sarwan, no run on off, up there, and Sarwan does well to even manoeuvre that into the leg-side, wristy wrists agogo, but yet again he can't pick the gap. I think the stump mic was turned off that time, just in case"
399,"Watson to Sarwan, no run on a good length, driven into the covers"
400,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run strays on leg and that's driven in front of midwicket"
401,"Watson to Lara, 1 run strayed down off and that's played out to the man on the fine-leg boundary"
402,"McGrath to Lara, FOUR runs too much width - don't bowl there to him! - and that's cracked through cover on the up, top shot"
403,"McGrath to Lara, no run much better, straight and fuller, Lara squeezing that into the on side"
404,"McGrath to Lara, no run again, up there, even fuller, and Lara can only defend, in an orthodox manner"
405,"McGrath to Lara, no run Lara makes obvious his intent to leave that one, whirling his bat round his head as he does so"
406,"McGrath to Lara, no run another leave, slightly less theatrical, but he decided early again - the ball once more pinging outside off and floating a touch away from him"
407,"McGrath to Lara, no run down that off channel again, the batsman completing a third leave in a row"
408,"Watson to Sarwan, 2 runs crashed away behind point for two easy runs"
409,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run a fumble at midwicket - will they? Won't they? They will, and it's easy in the end"
410,"Watson to Lara, no run stays over the wicket and that's just full enough to prevent Lara swinging out at that one"
411,"Watson to Lara, no run driven out to the covers this time where it's picked up easily enough"
412,"Watson to Lara, no run quicker one, outside off, an attempted yorker but he got his line wrong, too wide and Lara's not interested"
413,"Watson to Lara, no run carved into the covers, but straight to the man. There's a menacing inner ring of fielders waiting to snap something up and the pressure's still building"
414,"Tait to Sarwan, no run flings that one in at a good length, and straight, and that's defended down"
415,"Tait to Sarwan, no run a touch of width, and Sarwan cuts that down on the rise, straight to point"
416,"Tait to Sarwan, no run short and Sarwan fails to get it away, jabbing it into the covers. He's giving himself a strict talking to, as the frustration grows"
417,"Tait to Sarwan, no run pushed right up there and defended on the front foot"
418,"Tait to Sarwan, no run short, attempted bouncer and that's well ducked under"
419,"Tait to Sarwan, 1 run on leg and swished to square where Mr Cricket pretends to throw it back into the keeper. He loves his cricket"
420,"Watson to Sarwan, no run dropped. Now that would have been a really good take - still, it was a definite chance from a short ball taken by Sarwan from off to just in front of mid-on and Hussey dives, but shells"
421,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run tries to work it to mid-on again"
422,"Watson to Lara, no run tucked into the midwicket region"
423,"Watson to Lara, FOUR runs slower legcutter and Lara leans into that, strong and with consummate timing, and he smashes it through cover"
424,"Watson to Lara, 1 run hammered straight to Symonds at cover, there was a misfield as it bobbled just in front of him, and that allows the single"
425,"Watson to Sarwan, no run straight, with a touch of room, and Sarwan stands tall to ease that one in front of midwicket, but doesn't get much power on it"
426,"Tait to Lara, no run more grunting, but it's straighter and that's defended down this time"
427,"Tait to Lara, no run more grunting, like being at Wimbledon on a bad day, and that's pushed right up there, the ball driven back to mid-on"
428,"Tait to Lara, FOUR runs short and pulled strong, and brilliantly, in front of midwicket. Not much wrong with that delivery from Tait, just short of a length, but Lara helps himself, and dismissively - disdainfully, even - swats that one away"
429,"Tait to Lara, no run clever thinking from Tait, Lara dancing down and Tait answering his charge by cramping him up"
430,"Tait to Lara, no run defended into the covers this time"
431,"Tait to Lara, no run just outside off and that's check-drived straight to the man at cover"
432,"Watson to Sarwan, no run whipped off his legs and, oh that's a marvellous piece of fielding from possibly Ponting at short midwicket, throwing down the stumps - and Bracken does well to save an overthrown four"
433,"Watson to Sarwan, no run cracked into the covers, but straight to the man"
434,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run full and straight, worked to mid-on for a single"
435,"Watson to Lara, no run mighty, mighty close there. On a length, too full to be pulling - but Lara is desperate now, and goes for an almighty heave-ho over midwicket, missing it completely"
436,"Watson to Lara, no run banged into the pitch and it's left alone this time"
437,"Watson to Lara, FOUR runs what a remarkable shot that is from Lara. Slayed through cover - almost falling backwards as he does so, the bat swirling with an extravagant follow-through and it scudded across the turf for four"
438,"Tait to Sarwan, 1 run in the air, but it flies over point and lands short of deep extra cover"
439,"Tait to Lara, 1 wide that'll be a wide, no worries there. Flung down the leg side with an audible grunt by Tait"
440,"Tait to Lara, 1 run on leg stump, and worked calmly to mid-on"
441,"Tait to Sarwan, 1 run really crisply hit off the back foot. Sarwan plays that stroke very competently, just punching it really, never trying to hit it too hard"
442,"Tait to Lara, 1 wide miles wide of the off stump, although not quite a Harmiwide. Tait looks as confused as anyone"
443,"Tait to Lara, FOUR runs short, very short, on leg stump. Lara pulls, gets a thin edge around the corner and it races down for four. Fine batting"
444,"Tait to Lara, FOUR runs bosh! Lara at his best there, flaying this on the up behind square for another four"
445,"Tait to Lara, FOUR runs oooh, the tide is turning here. Lara's flicked the switch. A fine ball on off stump, Lara tries to work it to leg - gets a thick outside edge which first slip would've poached with ease...but Australia are slipless"
446,"Watson to Sarwan, no run just short of a length, and an excellent line here which he works greyly to midwicket"
447,"Watson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan takes a step down the pitch here"
448,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run pushed into the covers"
449,"Watson to Lara, 1 run on off stump, Lara just pushes it to mid-off and grabs a single"
450,"Watson to Sarwan, no run elegant, flourishing drive. For nothing."
451,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run chipped down the ground for the most facile of singles"
452,"Hogg to Sarwan, 2 runs full - and wide - allowing Sarwan to go down on one knee, propose to the ball, before smashing it wide of cover"
453,"Hogg to Sarwan, no run clunkily driven straight into the ground. Symonds dives, quite brilliantly, to save a run"
454,"Hogg to Sarwan, no run cracked to point off the back foot"
455,"Hogg to Sarwan, 1 run again wider, but greater spin here, turning back into the right hander who punches it back to him"
456,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run Lara charges him, smashing it on the full to Hogg who actually does really well, diving - tongue still hanging out of his mouth - and getting a hand to it"
457,"Hogg to Sarwan, no run defended on the front foot"
458,"Watson to Lara, 1 run defended off the back foot"
459,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run good length"
460,"Watson to Lara, 1 run short, rising onto Lara's cranium who keeps his eye on the ball - almost lining up his head with it, in fact - before paddling it around the corner"
461,"Watson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan gives Watson the charge, crashing this to mid-off but he again can't find the gap there"
462,"Watson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan back-cuts this to Clarke at point who, brilliantly, throws down the stumps, forcing Sarwan to hurry his bat back into the crease"
463,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run pushed down the ground"
464,"Hogg to Bravo, no run lovely ball - quicker, on leg stump and he's right forward to it, defending it with firmness"
465,"Hogg to Bravo, no run short, wide, cut off the back foot to point"
466,"Hogg to Bravo, no run ooh and he's done him in the length there"
467,"Hogg to Bravo, no run punched to silly point"
468,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run short of a length, he rocks back and punches it into the covers. And they steal a decidedly cheeky single"
469,"McGrath to Bravo, FOUR runs remarkable shot! Punched on the front foot past the bowler for four. Beautifully timed"
470,"McGrath to Bravo, 1 run pushed to cover - oh dear, they're going for a single. Here comes the throw from cover, and he's just home"
471,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run on off stump, neither a threatening line or length - no pace either - and Lara clubs it down the ground"
472,"McGrath to Bravo, 1 run too straight, whipped-creamed off his legs for a single"
473,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run and he's done it, dropping this into the leg side and stealing the strike"
474,"Hogg to Lara, no run not a bad shout indeed from Hogg. Lara gave him the charge but replays confirm not only my blindness, but my deafness too, as Lara clubbed that into his foot"
475,"Hogg to Lara, no run another roar from Hogg as Lara is rapped on the pads, but it's down the leg side"
476,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run and again Lara charges him, but Hogg fires it down quicker and straighter. Clipped for a single"
477,"Hogg to Bravo, 3 runs bravo, Dwayne. Just short of a length and he's quick to rock back and crunch it off the back foot. Not quite as well timed as he'd like, but he's fleet of foot"
478,"Hogg to Lara, 1 wide short and down the leg side"
479,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run again short, and slow, Lara pulls it while down on one knee"
480,"Hogg to Bravo, no run crashed off the back foot to point. Only just short of point..."
481,"McGrath to Lara, no run too leg side from the ageing fast bowler, clipped back to him"
482,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run and it's pushed out to long-off"
483,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run defended on the front foot"
484,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run pushed out to cover"
485,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run beaten. Cracking ball, jagging back into a meek defensive prod"
486,"Hogg to Lara, 1 wide down the leg side, Lara sweeps and misses"
487,"Hogg to Lara, no run"
488,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run the wrong'un, turning away from the left hander who cuts it to third man and gets a single. And his fifty"
489,"Hogg to Ramdin, FOUR runs calmly, elegantly driven through cover. Full toss, four. As it should be."

491,"Hogg to Ramdin, no run excellent feet from Ramdin, skipping back and hammering this into the covers"
492,"Hogg to Ramdin, 1 run comes forward to meet this wider ball, clumping it without power to cover"
493,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run chops down and an inside edge crashes into the ground, threatening to take the off sticke. He gets away with it this time"
494,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run pushed into the covers"
495,"McGrath to Ramdin, FOUR runs width from McGrath and that's hammered off the back foot with a crashing blow through cover. We like that"
496,"McGrath to Ramdin, no run straight, and McGrath, like a doting father, tucks him right up. No lullaby, though"
497,"McGrath to Ramdin, 1 run straight again, but Ramdin takes a stride to off to swish it back to leg and there's an easy run there"
498,"McGrath to Lara, 1 run short and Lara connects cleanly, pulling that down to square"
499,"Hogg to Lara, no run poked down off the back foot"
500,"Hogg to Lara, 2 runs waits on the back foot, and makes a smidge of room for one which is wide already, to work that through point"
501,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run doesn't quite get hold of that one, teeing off with an off-drive"
502,"Hogg to Ramdin, 1 run Hogg has taken a blow of another kind, that one dibbled into the gully and Clarke shies that over to the non-striker's end where it bounces up and, let's just say, awkwardly at Hogg. Hogg smiles, or was that winces?"
503,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run tickled to midwicket"
504,"Bracken to Lara, no run pushed right up there, straight, and that's dug out well"
505,"Bracken to Lara, FOUR runs what a short, Lara just waits and, well, that was magnificent - he deftly touches that away through the vacant first slip"
506,"Bracken to Lara, 1 run played out behind point"
507,"Bracken to Ramdin, 1 run short and belted towards midwicket"
508,"Bracken to Lara, no run driven to the man at long-off this time"

510,"Hogg to Lara, SIX runs clears the man at long-off - well clear - with, well you can probably guess but I'll tell you anyway, a really sweet straight drive... comes out of his crease and latches on quickly and sends that high and straight"
511,"Hogg to Lara, 2 runs a let-off - Lara going for the repeat but not quite getting the distance, but that drops short of the man at extra cover"
512,"Hogg to Lara, 1 run shuffle-drives that one off his front foot to long-off"
513,"Hogg to Ramdin, 1 run oh, Hogg nearly does him with one that's pitched up there and he nearly falls into that shot, nearly"
514,"Hogg to Lara, 2 runs overthrows - a desperate shy at the striker's end from Watson after Lara tried to sweep on one knee, not cleanly connecting"
515,"Hogg to Lara, 2 runs neat shot, walking into that and rushing it in front of midwicket for two"
516,"Bracken to Ramdin, FOUR runs short, slower, and the batsman does well to give himself room, tucking back to time that well behind point off the back foot and it races away"
517,"Bracken to Ramdin, 1 run angles across Ramdin and that's crashed in the air through gully but evades a diving Clarke"
518,"Bracken to Lara, 1 run outside off and that's guided easily away to deep third man"

528,"Symonds to Smith, 2 runs wide and that's worked into the covers"
529,"Symonds to Smith, 1 run right up there and driven out to long-on"
530,"Symonds to Ramdin, 2 runs guided down through third man"
531,"Symonds to Ramdin, 2 runs more width, Symonds struggling with his line here, and that's dinked into the off side"
532,"Hogg to Ramdin, no run worked off the back foot to point and it's zoomed back in underarm"
533,"Hogg to Ramdin, 1 run drags that a touch short and that's a bit of a despairing - yet at the same time forceful -sweep round to square"
534,"Hogg to Smith, SIX runs now this is a nice shot! Down the track, left, right, left and that's struck very well over cow corner"
535,"Hogg to Taylor, no run oh, nearly took the edge there as that one turned right back in from leg and popped up a touch too, a devil to play"

543,"Hogg to Taylor, 1 run turns in from outside leg, the batsman has room, in turn, to turn that in front of midwicket. Lots of turning, like a driving Test or nothing (ah, test... too much cricket!)"

566,"Tait to Ramdin, 1 run worked off his legs for a single"
567,"Tait to Powell, 1 run crashed on the front foot, but there's no power in the stroke"

579,"In dismissing them inside their 50 overs, Australia have avoided a slow over-rate penalty. And it's a big, big win for them - 103 runs - with just Brian Lara, inevitably, holding up their victory charge with a slick 77. Denesh Ramdin showed plenty of ability and class in his 52 but it was the failings of the top-order which hurt the West Indies. Chris Gayle 2; Sh"
