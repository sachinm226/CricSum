0,"This is Australia's final chance to walk away from Indian shores with a series win from this tour. A victory tonight will keep their chances alive heading into the third and final match. Australia have written a new and the most comprehensive chapter yet on collapses. It has been the overriding theme of their tour, and sadly, with two matches remaining before they fly back, they are yet to find answers. Here's Alagappan Muthu's preview to set things up while we wait for the toss."
1,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs and a four straight away, Barsapara finds its voice. Extremely wide and a full toss, Rohit reaches out and pats it away through backward point"
2,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run full, a little bit of nip into the right-hander just outside off, Rohit quietly defends with a straight bat"
3,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs shot. That has been put away with ease. Too full and well wide of him. Rohit swoops the bat down at some pace and drives straight down the ground. The bat turned in his hands slightly so he didn't middle it but gets four anyway"
4,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, OUT just like that, Barsapara has gone quiet. Not for long, though, as out comes the ever-popular Indian captain. Rohit pays for a lack of feet movement. Comes half-forward to this length ball that pitches around middle and off and beats him bu nipping in ever-so-slightly. Pings him plumb in front"
5,"Behrendorff to Kohli, no run fullish length, a very tight line on middle and leg, Kohli respectfully defends back"
6,"Behrendorff to Kohli, OUT in the air and Behrendorff has run forward to catch it. He is claiming the catch, or is that an appeal for lbw? Seems like caught it is. Otherwise, height may have been a factor in the lbw. Back of a length, pushed across but zero room. Pitches around middle and comes into Kohli who tries to flick across the line. Gets a feather of an inside edge on to the high part of the bat. The ball lobs in the air and Behrendorff sprints forward to claim the catch. Excellent comeback after a first-ball four"
7,"Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 1 run slashes hard at this short and wide delivery and does not find the middle of the bat, on the bounce to deep backward point"
8,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run lots of movement away outside off. Slightly back of a length, the movement is prodigious enough for Pandey to suss it out and keep his bat inside"
9,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run short of a length, a bit of nip away again, Pandey gets on top of the bounce and drops it in front of point"
10,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, 2 runs shortish, comes into the batsman this time. Pandey backs away and punches it away through the point region for a brace"
11,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run full, jags away late outside off, Pandey carves out a drive straight to covers"
12,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, 1 leg bye short of a length, comes into the pads of Pandey who tucks it around the corner for a single"
13,"Behrendorff to Pandey, FOUR runs short, pushed across, opens the face of his bat very late and jams it down to third man. Past the wide first slip who dives to his right"
14,"Behrendorff to Pandey, OUT oh, lovely delivery! Jason Behrendorff, you beauty! What a spell he's having! Short of good length, gets it to move away just enough and later still to find the outside edge of Pandey who is culpable of sticking his bat away from the body. Clear noise as he sent a nick through to Paine who holds on to a straightforward offering"
15,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run back of a length and pacy outside off, pushed across the off-stump of Jadhav who shoulders arms"
16,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run short of good length, sees enough width and lifts his bat but the ball straightens late. Well away from the off-stump, though"
17,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run length ball on off, defends solidly into the pitch"
18,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run short of good length, pitches outside leg and comes on just outside off, Jadhav gets on top of the bounce and blocks solidly"
19,"Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 1 run short of a length, dabs down to third man with an open bat face"
20,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, 1 run just over point. Maxwell is the fielder there, throws himself to his right and leaps a good couple of meters across. Short and wide, flayed hard"
21,"Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 3 leg byes short ball, gets big on him and goes for a pull. The ball lobs over the cordon. Seemed like a top-edge initially but turns out it has gone off the helmet. Aaron Finch runs back and makes a brilliant effort to slide forward and pull the ball back"
22,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, no run full, outside off, jabbed hard to mid-off"
23,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, SIX runs is that the shot of the night? Me thinks so. Just short of a length, comes in slightly and he stays firmly on the backfoot before pulling with impeccable timing and power - a short-arm jab over midwicket"
24,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, no run short, wide, chops an attempted cut into the ground"
25,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run fuller, comes in from outside off and finds the inside part of the bat as Dhawan looks to drill it. Goes away to mid-on"
26,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run short of a length, curving in towards off, takes a step away and works it to point"
27,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT that's a stunning catch from David Warner. Take a bow, skipper! He had to pedal back, and by no short distance, mind you. Falls over as he snaffles it having judged to perfection. Dhawan simply presented the full face of his bat to this fuller ball. He chips it over the in-field but it needed impeccable timing for the ball to carry all the way over the boundary. That's not to so, but this was always a 50-percent chance converted into a definite wicket by Warner's brilliance"
28,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run short ball, pushed across, bottom-edges a pull to midwicket"
29,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, FOUR runs short, wide, Jadhav lashes a cut over the point region. One-bounce over the ropes"
30,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run short of a length, pushed across invitingly with width to make the batsman go after it. Jadhav tries to runs it down and gets beaten"
31,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run classic Dhoni! Walks forward for a gentle flick into the leg side. It's shorter than he would have liked, inside-edges it into the leg side"
32,"Tye to Jadhav, no run short, goes hard at a pull but the ball doesn't get up as much and he inside-edges it hard on to the boot"
33,"Tye to Jadhav, FOUR runs too much width. Slightly short of a length, cuts late and ferociously hard to beat point"
34,"Tye to Jadhav, 1 run flicked to square leg"
35,"Tye to Dhoni, no run full, lets it come into him and flicks slightly uppishly but the ball lands safely before the short fine leg fielder"
36,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run short of a length, tucked through the square leg region for an easy single"
37,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, pushed across. Dhoni walks across and flicks it out to deep square leg"
38,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, no run walks across again to this back of a length ball but is forced to make a late adjustment and defend with a straight bat because of the line"
39,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, 2 runs length ball, flicked just backward of square leg and Dhoni sprints back for the second. That's terrific running"
40,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, 1 run was that a catch. Doesn't seem like it judging by Australia's reaction. Full, wide, Dhoni jams the bat down and the ball has bumped into the ground before going to the right of the keeper who does well to get down and prevent a boundary"
41,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run full, wide, pushed to point"
42,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run now how about that? Did that carry? Extremely full on the stumps, Jadhav knocked it back to the bowler. Behrendorff dives forward but can't hold on. We will have to wait for replays to confirm if it was a chance. But an excellent spell nonetheless. He's through with his quota"
43,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run fullish length, spinning away, comes forward and pushes it out"
44,"Zampa to Dhoni, 1 run advances down to this slider and pushes it wide of long-on"
45,"Zampa to Jadhav, 2 runs looped up and sliding on leg, clipped away to deep fine leg. The fielder in the deep is squarer and they complete a brace"
46,"Zampa to Jadhav, no run length, spinning away on off, punched to the bowler"
47,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run full on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket"
48,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run fuller, driven to mid-off"
49,"Stoinis to Jadhav, FOUR runs is that four? Yes. Glanced fine enough to easily beat deep backward square leg to his right.Full and straying down the leg side"
50,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 run pulls across the line. Lots of power but he finds deep midwicket. Fetches the shot from way outside off"
51,"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run short of a length, looks for a punch through the off side. He shuffled across before the delivery so he is tucked up and gets beaten very narrowly"
52,"Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run full on middle and leg, turned away to deep square leg for one"
53,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run full, finds the inside part of the bat as he presses forward to defend"
54,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 run full, flicked to deep square leg"
55,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run length ball, spinning away on middle and off, whipped to the leg side"
56,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run advances down and Zampa shortens the length, Dhoni punches to mid-off"
57,"Zampa to Dhoni, FOUR runs brings those powerful wrists into play. That shot was all wrist-work. Full toss, whipped hard wide of deep midwicket"
58,"Zampa to Dhoni, no run charges down the track at the sight of width but the ball dips and Dhoni yorks himself as he squeezes out to cover"
59,"Zampa to Dhoni, 1 wide advances down and Zampa fires it wide of the batsman. Dhoni is equal to the task and manages to halt in his tracks and keep the backfoot planted. Had to really stretch there"
60,"Zampa to Dhoni, OUT no cheeky work this time from Dhoni. He has been stumped clean and Zampa lets out a roar. Length ball, Dhoni advances again. It spins sharpy away from him and there is little the batsman can do from that position. Gets nowhere close to the ball and Paine completes a simple stumping"
61,"Zampa to Hardik, 1 run pitched up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
62,"Tye to Hardik, SIX runs Pandya has finally woken up. That's one powerful pull the crowd has been dying to see. Too short and dispatched well over deep midwicket"
63,"Tye to Hardik, no run short of a length, opens the face and runs it down to backward point"
64,"Tye to Hardik, 2 runs short ball, pace off and Pandya can't time his shot too well. What he does do well, though, is pick the gap and that allows him to come back for two"
65,"Tye to Hardik, 1 run short of a length, opens the face and steers to short third man"
66,"Tye to Kuldeep, 1 run full, gets the pad forward and flicks it to deep fine leg to bring up the 100 for India"
67,"Tye to Hardik, 1 run another full toss, waist-high, or is it? The umpires deem it fine. Does well to negotiate with the height and pat it into the on side"
68,"Stoinis to Hardik, 1 run fetches a pull from way outside off, it's the slower ball, and it ends up being nothing more than a heave over midwicket"
69,"Stoinis to Kuldeep, 1 run slower back of a length ball, Kuldeep susses out the pace and runs it down to third man late"
70,"Stoinis to Hardik, OUT straight into the hands of long-off. Pandya seemed like he could haul India to a decent total but he's gone now with 15 deliveries remaining. Tries to launch this fuller ball but it's just too full and that doesn't allow him the chance to get under it"
71,"Stoinis to Bumrah, 1 wide another slower short ball, the bounce is too high and the square leg umpire calls it wide as the batsman misses a weak attempt at a hook"
72,"Stoinis to Bumrah, no run short of good length ball, knocked back to the bowler"
73,"Stoinis to Bumrah, no run ain't got no clue about that one. Short of a length, zero width as it comes on straight and Bumrah backs away slightly and clumsily attempts a steer to third man only to make no contact"
74,"Stoinis to Bumrah, no run now that's much better. Stays in the crease, waits for it and opens the face, just that he finds wide slip"
75,"Stoinis to Hardik, no run short of a length, comes in on middle and leg, kept out"
76,"Stoinis to Hardik, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, nudged away from off the hips into the leg side"
77,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 run short of a length, uses the angle to whip it away to long leg"
78,"Stoinis to Hardik, no run short of a length, on middle and leg, defended"
79,"Stoinis to Hardik, 3 runs full toss, clipped off the pads between midwicket and square leg. Tye runs to his left and gets down to make a good save"
80,"Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 leg bye looks for a flick and wears it on the pad. Stoinis makes a very late appeal but that was comfortably headed down leg"
81,"Zampa to Jadhav, OUT googly, and the stumps are a mess! Jadhav clears his front leg, seeing a loopy delivery in line with off stump. He shapes to launch it straight over Zampa's head, but the ball dips on him, it breaks the wrong way, and topples the stumps. Australia on the rise. On a massive rise."
82,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, no run loops it up again to the new batsman, Bhuvneshwar reads it as the googly and defends well"
83,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, no run backs away to a shortish delivery, but it comes so slowly off the pitch, that Bhuvneshwar has to check his cut shot"
84,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, no run carves a quicker, flatter delivery outside off to backward point"
85,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run finds the gap to the right of backward point, hitting off the backfoot with a straight bat"
86,"Zampa to Hardik, 1 run opens the face against a faster, flatter delivery on off stump and retains strike with a single to short third man"
87,"Coulter-Nile to Kuldeep, 1 wide short of a length, sprays it down the leg side and called a wide as the batsman misses the glance"
88,"Coulter-Nile to Kuldeep, 1 wide short ball, drops the wrists and the bounce is deemed too high by the umpire. Right call, that went way over the batsman's head"
89,"Coulter-Nile to Kuldeep, 1 run length ball on the stumps, bunts it out into the on side and beats Coulter-Nile rushing forward for the single"
90,"Coulter-Nile to Bumrah, no run full, wide, reaches out and goes for a big, booming drive to get beaten"
91,"Coulter-Nile to Bumrah, FOUR runs just past the keeper. Bumrah loses shape as he swings across the line looking for a heave over the leg side. Gets a leading edge that gets past Tim Paine flying to his right"
92,"Coulter-Nile to Bumrah, 1 run yorker on leg stump, dug out into the on side"
93,"Coulter-Nile to Kuldeep, 1 run short of a length, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
94,"Coulter-Nile to Bumrah, 1 run Bumrah survives a near run-out. Chips a fuller ball that remains in the air and drops short of mid-off charging forward. Bumrah is taking the single and Coulter-Nile is on the way of the batsman. Bumrah collides and the throw misses the stumps at the non-striker's end even as he recovers and scampers for the crease. Bumrah unhappy but that was not deliberate from the bowler. Coulter-Nile had his back to Bumrah. Coulter-Nile was actually moving across slightly to back up the throw"
95,"Tye to Bumrah, no run opens the face but can't connect as he tries to steer to third man"
96,"Tye to Bumrah, 1 run swings across the line and gets an inside edge to the pad.They take a quick single"
97,"Tye to Kuldeep, OUT advances down and the bowler drags the length back. Kuldeep wears it on the thigh and the ball goes to the left of Paine who runs across and throws with his keeping gloves on. Direct hit catches Bumrah short"
98,"Tye to Chahal, no run short, looks to pull and loses shape as the ball is slow and he swings early"
99,"Tye to Chahal, 3 runs just over the outstretched hands of point. Clears the leg and lofts this over the fielder. He gets a fingertip to it. Head at the deep picks it up and throws to Paine.But the batsmen are going for a third and Paine fires at the non-striker's end. Chahal nearly collides with the bowler as he dives to make the crease. The throw does not hit the stumps"
100,"Tye to Kuldeep, OUT goes for a big slog and gets a top-edge that goes very high and Paine behind the stumps moves to his right and settles under it"
101,"""It was unbelievable.Bowling four upfront doesn't happen too often and I was lucky to do it.Bowling upfront and swinging the new ball is a strength and it is an honour to be opening the bowling for your country. The wicket was good, it was a little slow. Worked really hard for a long time. My first experience was just one over, my second one here has been very good. I'm taking nothing for granted. I have full faith in our batsmen chasing this down."""
102,"8.45pm So India lose all their wickets. Jason Behrendorff set the template with his early burst and India never recovered. Australia exploited the early movement well and never let India to gather steam. This pitch still has something for the bowlers, so don't count India out yet. But remember that the dew has set in which will make India's job harder. Alagappan will be with you shortly for the chase. Over and out from me."
103,"India don't do well defending small targets. The lowest they have set and then won is 139. And in Guwahati, they have to deal with a heck of a lot of dew. Anyway, here are Aaron Finch and David Warner. They don't have much to chase, and that's exactly how they'd like it considering they have to win today to keep the series alive. Bhuvneshwar Kumar to run in with the new ball. Two slips in place."
104,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 wide good length ball, darting down the leg side. Finch aims a flick, but can't connect. Would've been a great ball to Warner, who is at the other end, and who has been struggling against Bhuvi this tour"
105,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run darts into the right-hander, and Finch, who doesn't really move his feet, is struck on the thigh as he tries to find a single behind square leg"
106,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 3 runs goes wide of the crease to bowl the outswinger, but Finch is able to time is well enough, through cover point. Pandey chases it down, relays it to Kohli, who sends the throw in to Dhoni, who collects it to the right of the stumps, and flicks it between his legs onto the target. Warner is safe though"
107,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run pushes it to the left of backward point, but Pandey dives across to stop it. Excellent work."
108,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length, punches it to Kohli at cover"
109,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run cramps him on middle and leg, Warner defends well"
110,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 2 runs over the square leg fielder running back! Warner tries a short-arm pull, but his timing is all off. The ball goes off the top edge and eludes Chahal"
111,"Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs too short and Finch simply helps it on its way to the backward square leg boundary. Fine shot, swivelling on his back leg"
112,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run pitches it up further, and Finch, rooted to the crease because of that better length, defends off the inside edge"
113,"Bumrah to Henriques, no run back of a length on off stump, defends into midwicket"
114,"Bumrah to Henriques, 1 run sees width and so dabs a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man"
115,"Bumrah to Finch, no run full on off stump, drives to mid-on"
116,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run gets up with a back of a length delivery outside off and blunts it"
117,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, 1 run superb strike, but mid-off runs to his left and dives to stop the ball from skirting past. Jadhav doing good work to stop a well timed off drive from Henriques"
118,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shortish delivery outside off, defends. And as Bhuvneshwar walks back, he drags his feet over the area where he lands on the popping crease, quite vigorously"
119,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run back of a length and outside off, blocks it"
120,"Bhuvneshwar to Head, 1 run short on the pads, flicks it to deep square leg"
121,"Bumrah to Head, no run defends a good length ball on off stump"
122,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR runs superb drive! And pin-drop silence! Guwahati has been moving to Kohli's tune, roaring when their captain raises his hands and eggs them on. Here they are stunned by an on-the-up straight drive of the highest class"
123,"Bumrah to Head, 2 runs shortish on off stump, skews it away through midwicket off a bit of an inside edge"
124,"Bumrah to Head, no run goes around the wicket for a full delivery on off stump, Head defuses it to mid-on"
125,"Bumrah to Head, no run beaten as a good length ball holds its line outside off and Head is left looking like an amateur"
126,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR runs timing, sensational! Of course, it's allowed to come out when the bowler strays onto the pads and the batsman has an easy put away through square leg"
127,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run reaches away from his body as Bhuvneshwar dangles a good length ball, that seams further away. Blocks it gingerly"
128,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run extra bounce but Henriques does well, using his height, to get on top of the ball and push it to mid-off. Goes down to thud his bat into the middle of the pitch to make it behave"
129,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run attempts a forceful drive down the ground, but only gets an inside edge onto the pad"
130,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run beats him with an outswinger and they go up for an appeal. No bat involved though. Henriques done in by a ball that hits the seam and darts away past the edge"
131,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run even better! This is fuller. It's closer to off stump. it demands Henriques to play and then dances past the outside edge. All that was missing is an evil cackle"
132,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, 1 run now for the one that is angled into off stump, and Henriques, lunging forward to defend, gets an inside edge behind square leg"
133,"Bumrah to Henriques, no run length ball, angling in on off, flicked to midwicket"
134,"Bumrah to Henriques, no run back of a length, punched to mid-off"
135,"Bumrah to Henriques, SIX runs that's out of here. That has sailed miles over deep square leg and smashed the grille of the stands there. Short ball, smokes a pull with immense power"
136,"Bumrah to Henriques, 1 run short of a length, nipping away late, stays back and tries to reach out wide for a punch, gets an outside edge that runs down to square third man"
137,"Bumrah to Head, 1 run full, curving in on off, drilled to mid-on"
138,"Bumrah to Henriques, 1 run full on off, pushed towards mid-on for a very quick single"
139,"Hardik to Henriques, no run darts away past the outside edge! Gorgeous ball. Pitches it up, outside off, it deviates off the seam and leave Henqriques staring daggers at the pitch"
140,"Hardik to Henriques, no run back of a length and outside off, chops it as he tries to cut"
141,"Hardik to Henriques, 1 run inside edge, as this time Pandya makes the ball seam into the right-hander. Henriques defends but not exactly comfortably. India's lines so far have been excellent."

143,"Hardik to Head, 1 run punches a shortish delivery past mid-on's right"
144,"Hardik to Henriques, no run defends a good length ball on middle"
145,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run steps out and slams a flighted delivery outside off to long-off"
146,"Kuldeep to Henriques, SIX runs too short, and though it does turn a long way, that only helps Henriques pick his spot better. Hits it to the square leg boundary"
147,"Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run hides deep in his crease, reading the ball off the pitch, being allowed to do so by the shortish length. Punch to long-on"
148,"Kuldeep to Head, no run loops it up outside off, Head ignores it"
149,"Kuldeep to Head, 2 runs belts a half-volley down to long-on and Pandya races to his right to stop the boundary with a big dive."
150,"Kuldeep to Head, FOUR runs too short and Head wallops it to the midwicket boundary, well to the right of the man in the deep"
151,"Hardik to Henriques, 2 runs walks out, to try and push the bowler's length back, and therefore prevent him from being able to seam the ball around. Succeeds in that and pulls the short ball to long leg"
152,"Hardik to Henriques, FOUR runs too short, and down the leg side as well, Henriques pulls it to the long leg boundary, very fine and very easily done."
153,"Hardik to Henriques, 1 run back of a length on off stump, Henriques moves across and clips it to square leg."
154,"Hardik to Head, FOUR runs walks at Pandya, to force his length back, and having done so, he is able to pull it through the gap at midwicket. Excellent batting."
155,"Hardik to Head, no run when the bowler can pitch it up, batting is hard, as this shows. Head can only defend one coming at the top of off."
156,"Hardik to Head, no run goes for the ole heave ho, seeing a fuller, slower ball outside off. Misses it altogether"
157,"Chahal to Henriques, no run pushes it through on middle, and it hurries off the pitch, cramping Henriques even as he tries to make room. Just about defends it"
158,"Chahal to Henriques, no run"
159,"Chahal to Henriques, 1 run this one is a little short, and Henriques backs away to cut it through cover. Kohli gets a hand to it and deflects it to long-off"
160,"Chahal to Head, 1 run heaves it away to deep midwicket. Chahal not tossing it up, perhaps spooked by the idea of the batsman running at him"
161,"Chahal to Henriques, no run gives it a little more air, and it drifts into middle and leg. Henriques clears the front leg, but has to stick to defence as the ball turns sharply"
162,"Chahal to Henriques, FOUR runs beautiful late cut! Reads the length so early, sets himself in position to take advantage of the field, which has third man up. Little dab, maximum reward"
163,"Kuldeep to Head, no run tosses it up outside off, Head bunts it down the ground"
164,"Kuldeep to Head, FOUR runs lofts it to the deep midwicket boundary. Kuldeep is a touch slower than Chahal, so when he drops it short, it sits up for Head to do what he wishes."
165,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run launches a full delivery on leg stump to long-on"
166,"Kuldeep to Henriques, FOUR runs carves it through extra cover! Overpitches the ball, and Henriques makes it even worse by smashing it into the gap, to the right of the man sweeping on the boundary"

170,"Chahal to Head, 1 run full toss outside off, Head wallops it back at the bowler, who only gets a welt on his right hand as he tries to field it. The ball goes out towards long-on before Kohli intercepts it from midwicket"
171,"Chahal to Henriques, no run pulls a shortish delivery to midwicket"
172,"Chahal to Henriques, 1 run tosses it up outside leg, Henriques drills a drive to long-on"
173,"Chahal to Head, SIX runs sails into the crowd behind long-on. Tossing it up isn't helping. Bowling short isn't helping. The dew isn't helping and the small target isn't helping. Head taking advantage of all of that with a meaty blow"
174,"Chahal to Head, 2 runs slogs a flighted delivery from outside off out to deep midwicket"
175,"Kuldeep to Henriques, no run loops it up, from around the wicket, Henriques smashes it to cover"

178,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run clears the front leg and belts a tossed up delivery on middle to long-off"
179,"Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run positions himself across the stumps, and reads the googly off the pitch with the length being short as it is. Nudges behind square leg"
180,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run top edge, as he tries to sweep, and the ball beats Kohli running back from slip"
181,"Chahal to Head, 2 runs lashes it outside off, over to deep cover"
