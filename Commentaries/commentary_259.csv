0,"10.10am Members of the England Disability team, which has recently won the inaugural ICRC International T20 tournament in Bangladesh, are parading the trophy around the boundary. Fantastic achievement by them."
1,"10.20am Whatever happens today, England are unrecognisable from the listless, clueless rabble who skulked home from the World Cup in March, and a lot of the credit for that has to go to Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach who was interim boss in the early weeks of the summer. Gnasher caught up with hi"
2,"10.30am Right, Jerusalem has rung out, the teams are in the middle. A good toss to win is the verdict. We shall see ..."
3,"Starc to Roy, FOUR runs big swing, sliding down the leg side, helped on its way. Handy start"
4,"Starc to Roy, no run what a riposte! Full and straight, clattering into the knee-roll, and that is given out! Roy calls for a review, and there is a clear suspicion of inside-edge before the pad comes into play. A loud cheer from the crowd, but we await the umpire's verdict ... indeed it is not"
5,"Starc to Roy, no run swing, or should I say, schhher-wing! Roy is uncomfortably forward to smother that with bat and pad. Awkward"
6,"Starc to Taylor, no run compactly forward, driven into the covers"
7,"Starc to Taylor, no run shovelled into the leg side, the end of a lively over"
8,"Hastings to Hales, no run on the pads, turned without power into the leg side"
9,"Hastings to Hales, no run falling across another leg stump delivery. A squeaked appeal but nothing doing"
10,"Hastings to Hales, no run a tight line into the pads so far this over. Hales hasn't quite got his alignment right yet as his pads wear another delivery"
11,"Hastings to Hales, no run left alone outside off, no rush there"
12,"Hastings to Hales, no run a bit of lift outside off, Hales chases it with a wafty bat, just about avoids the edge"
13,"Hastings to Hales, no run firmly back in the crease. That's a maiden"
14,"Starc to Taylor, no run drawn forward and punched into the covers"
15,"Starc to Taylor, no run well timed drill into the covers, but safely snaffled at point"
16,"Starc to Taylor, no run lovely ball, perfect length, nipping away and climbing as it does so. Beats everything"
17,"Starc to Taylor, 1 wide more lively pace and carry but the line was awry that time"
18,"Starc to Taylor, FOUR runs wonderful flashing strike. No swing on that as Starc overpitched a fraction and Taylor battered that to the cover boundary"
19,"Starc to Taylor, no run tucked up on leg stump with a wicket-to-wicket line. Good riposte from Starc"
20,"Starc to Taylor, no run banged in short to complete the over. Taylor barely had to flinch to allow that to pass over his inconsiderable frame"
21,"Hastings to Hales, FOUR runs Hales is off the mark but in no great fashion. A flat-footed swish outside off, and an inside-edge sneaks past the leg stump"
22,"Hastings to Hales, no run left alone on length, brave judgement as the ball fizzes over the top of off"
23,"Hastings to Hales, no run back and across, defended out to cover"
24,"Hastings to Hales, no run excellent line and length from Hastings, a hint of nibble to keep Hales honest"
25,"Hastings to Hales, no run fuller length from wide on the crease. Raps the pads but way down leg"
26,"Hastings to Hales, OUT so nearly dropped at point, but grabbed at the second attempt! A horrid scratchy innings comes to an end. That was his first real shot in anger, and it scooted straight at Maxwell's head, who eventually clung onto the second attempt down by his knees"
27,"Starc to Taylor, no run line, length, swing. Lots to think about as Taylor rebuilds for England"
28,"Starc to Taylor, 1 run deflected down to third man off the splice as Taylor hops into line. Intentional stroke"
29,"Starc to Morgan, 1 run shovelled into the leg side and the skipper is up and running first ball"
30,"Starc to Taylor, FOUR runs forward and drilled through the covers. Superb timing from Taylor, who has no fear of the two slips as he continues to go for his strokes"
31,"Starc to Taylor, no run turned into the leg-side, on the drive again"
32,"Starc to Taylor, 1 run rides the bounce and deflects another single down to third man. He's looking busy already in this innings"
33,"Hastings to Taylor, no run drawn forward and defends into the covers"
34,"Hastings to Taylor, 2 runs tucked fine into the leg side and excellent scampering brings two more to the total"
35,"Hastings to Taylor, no run watchful defence"
36,"Hastings to Taylor, no run drawn forward again to meet the gentle but appreciable swing"
37,"Hastings to Taylor, OUT lovely delivery! Climbed off the deck and Hastings has his reward for perseverance. Taylor's eagerness to put bat on ball is his undoing as he feathers an edge through to Wade, and now England are in serious bother"
38,"Hastings to Stokes, no run solidly forward to meet his first delivery, pushed back to mid-on"
39,"Starc to Morgan, no run full and zipping past everything, flashing bat, and off stump remain unscathed though"
40,"Starc to Morgan, no run nips back into the left-hander's pads, it's a rough ride for England today"
41,"Starc to Morgan, no run forward and defended, bat and pad together"
42,"Starc to Morgan, no run solidly forward again"
43,"Starc to Morgan, no run yikes, now that is nasty! Morgan is in real trouble as he wears one on the helmet, a perfectly directed bouncer, but the concern on Australia's faces is genuine. The physio and doctor are out there giving him the once-over, but surely he'll have to retire hurt. It was on"
44,"Starc to Bairstow, no run a tame end to a ferocious over. Starc's body language is that of a man who doesn't want to have done what he's just done."
45,"Hastings to Stokes, no run outside off, left alone"
46,"Hastings to Stokes, no run tidy line, lifting past the off stump, Stokes leaves well alone"
47,"Hastings to Stokes, no run another ball whizzes by unchallenged outside off stump"
48,"Hastings to Stokes, 1 run on the back foot, defended into the off side and an urgent scamper through for a single"
49,"Hastings to Bairstow, no run crunched into the point region where Maxwell gathers with a leap"
50,"Hastings to Bairstow, FOUR runs tickled very fine, excellent placement as the fielder dives in vain but can't intercept. Welcome runs for a rather stagnated cause"
51,"Starc to Stokes, no run width, and no stroke offered"
52,"Starc to Stokes, no run pushed into the covers. Starc fields in his followthrough and blows his cheeks a touch. Looks like he turned his ankle a touch. Nothing serious though"
53,"Starc to Stokes, no run full length, well dug out"
54,"Starc to Stokes, FOUR runs full and flumped through the covers. Can't claim he timed the pants off that, but it beat the ring of fielders and had more than enough legs. Lots of bottom hand coming into play"
55,"Starc to Stokes, no run tighter line and defended"
56,"Starc to Stokes, FOUR runs now that's a lovely strike. Very full bat, very full face. Drilled straight down the ground. And that will probably be that for Starc's first spell"
57,"Hastings to Bairstow, no run deflected into the leg-side"
58,"Hastings to Bairstow, 1 run width, and steered out to point, where Maxwell, of all people, misfields to gift a single. He nearly dropped one earlier too ..."
59,"Hastings to Stokes, no run outside off stump, no stroke offered"
60,"Hastings to Stokes, no run forward and defended into the covers"
61,"Hastings to Stokes, FOUR runs too full that time, and Stokes loves to drive straight. Weight going through a perfectly perpendicular bat. Beautiful"
62,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run back of a length, climbing into the splice and a sharp single to third man"
63,"Cummins to Stokes, 1 wide banged in short, too short, ironic cheers"
64,"Cummins to Stokes, no run short again, over the shoulder"
65,"Cummins to Stokes, no run"
66,"Cummins to Stokes, 3 runs a nibble of width and Stokes is onto it with a measured drive to the edge of the cover boundary"
67,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run defended back down the track"
68,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run back of a length, punched into the covers"
69,"Marsh to Stokes, 1 run pushed out to cover, and a definite grimace in the followthrough. An awkward landing in a foothole?"
70,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run more grimacing from Marsh, who gets incredibly tight to the stumps once again"
71,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run attempted cut, but there's not enough width for the shot"
72,"Marsh to Bairstow, 1 run wicket to wicket delivery, deflected out to point"
73,"Marsh to Stokes, no run outside off, no stroke offered"
74,"Marsh to Stokes, 1 run full stride and flowing drive, out to the cover sweeper. England starting to build a partnership [cue second wave of collapsing]"
75,"Cummins to Stokes, 1 run a swished pull out to midwicket, not especially timed but decent shot"
76,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run climbing towards the pads, ricochets out to point, another quick single brings up the fifty"
77,"Cummins to Stokes, no run width, and a slash. No contact"
78,"Cummins to Stokes, no run driven back down the ground"
79,"Cummins to Stokes, FOUR runs too short, and emphatically slapped through midwicket. Powerful stroke, perfectly executed. That came at him at 90mph, but oodles of time to see it and slap it"
80,"Cummins to Stokes, no run back on a fuller length, end of the over"
81,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run Marsh continues, having been clutching his side between overs"
82,"Marsh to Bairstow, 2 runs another crunching cut but Starc is in situ on the third man boundary to cut off the four"
83,"Marsh to Bairstow, OUT massive appeal! Very full, very straight, but given not out ... it's a review.... no bat involved, now then, is it hitting leg full enough, indeed it is! That's out!"
84,"Marsh to Ali, FOUR runs well, that's the way to do it. See ball, hit ball for Ali as he drives fluently through the covers first ball"
85,"Marsh to Ali, no run a similar shot second-up, but this time short cover is in the way"
86,"Marsh to Ali, no run forward and defended to complete a successful over"
87,"Cummins to Stokes, no run a bit of nibble from back of a length, attempted steer into the covers"
88,"Cummins to Stokes, FOUR runs genuine edge, but it was straight through the gap, and wouldn't have carried at any rate. The perfect one-day shot ..."
89,"Cummins to Stokes, no run attempted back-foot biff, but the ball was a touch too full"
90,"Cummins to Stokes, FOUR runs short and scorched through midwicket, he was onto that the moment he read the length. Beautiful power and placement"
91,"Cummins to Stokes, no run short again, and Stokes attempts a glide over the slips. Can't quite reach it which is just as well as that might have been a feather to the keeper"
92,"Cummins to Stokes, no run solidly forward to a good-length delivery"
93,"Marsh to Ali, 1 run edged, through the largely vacant cordon, down to third man"
94,"Marsh to Stokes, no run full length, driven back towards the bowler"
95,"Marsh to Stokes, no run full and straight, nothing doing for the batsman"
96,"Marsh to Stokes, no run forward and drilled to mid-off. Solid strike but can't find the gap"
97,"Marsh to Stokes, no run cracked to point, Maxwell lurks"
98,"Marsh to Stokes, 1 run looking for the quick single, but no way through. Only two from a fine over"
99,"Cummins to Stokes, no run fast and straight, Stokes bides his time"
100,"Cummins to Stokes, no run"
101,"Cummins to Stokes, 2 runs another well-judged pull shot, he picks it so early, but can't beat the field this time"
102,"Cummins to Stokes, no run squelch! Stokes wears one right in the nether-regions and even he has the good grace to laugh about it between gasps for breath"
103,"Cummins to Stokes, no run"
104,"Cummins to Stokes, no run smashed on the up to point, another excellent over"
105,"Marsh to Ali, OUT a gloriously Gower-esque departure from Moeen Ali, as if to prove the earlier point! He played the shot on merit, but the upshot is an edge to the keeper and a rather desperate scoreline"
106,"Marsh to Willey, no run good length, Willey shuffles into line and prods it tentatively to the leg side"
107,"Marsh to Willey, OUT hit on the pads, huge appeal from Marsh... and Bailey's finger goes up! Is that another one gone? Willey asks for the review, this is going to depend on whether the ball pitched in line... and Hawk-Eye says it did, bang on and straightening, would have shuddered the top of"
108,"Marsh to Rashid, 1 run length ball on the off stump, there are a couple of slips waiting as Rashid pushes forward, gets a thick inside edge through backward square and a precious run for the cause"
109,"Marsh to Stokes, no run comes forward and defends solidly on off stump"
110,"Marsh to Stokes, no run fullish outside off, Stokes gently taps int the covers for a quiet end to another action-packed over"

113,"Cummins to Rashid, no run 88mph length delivery on off, Rashid gets front on and blocks doggedly"
114,"Cummins to Rashid, no run now the short ball, a snorter, flying through at throat height, Rashid weaves out of the way with impressive sangfroid"
115,"Cummins to Rashid, no run back of a length, stays back and keeps the ball down, the bottom hand coming off the bat"
116,"Cummins to Rashid, FOUR runs lovely stroke, Rashid is off the mark with a crisp square drive! He can bat, make no mistake, using Cummins' pace to his own advantage and cracking it on the up through the off side"
117,"Marsh to Stokes, no run angled across from over the wicket, tapped into the off side"
118,"Marsh to Stokes, 2 runs tough straight from Marsh, worked away off the pads with a firm clip into a gap at midwicket"
119,"Marsh to Stokes, SIX runs brutal, Stokes continues his Neo impression with a rousing thwack down the ground for six! Skipped out to a full ball and smoked it back into the sight screen... The crowd, and all right-thinking people, liked that"
120,"Marsh to Stokes, no run draws his length back, dabbed into the covers"
121,"Marsh to Stokes, no run length outside off, this shapes back at the left-hander, he judges it well and leaves"
122,"Marsh to Stokes, OUT struck on the pads, up goes the finger - Stokes is a goner, too! Very similar to the Willey dismissal, hit on the knee roll around the line of leg stump, umpire Bailey doesn't take long to make his decision and England have no more reviews. It looked a good appeal at first"

124,"Starc to Rashid, no run on the stumps, gets into line and defends"
125,"Starc to Rashid, 1 run presses out and gets an inside edge through the leg side"

127,"Starc to Wood, no run fires in the yorker, well-directed but Wood manages to drop his timber on it"
128,"Starc to Wood, 1 run full outside off and another thick edge squirts down to third man"
129,"Marsh to Wood, no run lets this one go through outside off"
130,"Marsh to Wood, 2 runs length outside off and Wood flashes this over gully, beyond the reach of even the Super Fielder Maxwell"
131,"Marsh to Wood, FOUR runs four more, this time shovelled over midwicket with a flick of the wrists! Had just enough on it to clear the leap of Burns and run away - cheers for the England 100. A minor achievement, in the context of the morning"
132,"Marsh to Wood, no run pitched up and driven towards mid-on"
133,"Marsh to Wood, 1 wide fired down the leg side"
134,"Marsh to Wood, no run length on off stump, Wood gets across and blocks"
135,"Marsh to Wood, no run slightly full, tempting the drive, Wood attempts to hit the cover off again and misses this time"
136,"Cummins to Topley, no run on the stumps, mid-80s mph, defended calmly back in the crease"
137,"Cummins to Topley, 5 runs pushed towards point, they set off on a kamikaze run... but Maxwell's effort is wide, fizzes past George Bailey at the non-striker's end and runs for four overthrows! Topley is off the mark with a five"
138,"Cummins to Rashid, 1 wide banged in short, Rashid ducks... and the crowd lairily greets the call of wide"
139,"Cummins to Rashid, no run short ball, drops back and pushes square"
140,"Cummins to Rashid, 1 run pitched up and driven firmly through the covers, they want two but there's a man out there and Topley will have to stay at the danger end"
141,"Cummins to Topley, 1 wide back of a length, down the leg side, flicks and misses - another extra"
142,"Cummins to Topley, no run spears the ball in full on off stump, Topley continues to block diligently"
143,"Cummins to Topley, no run good length on the stumps and Topley, who's getting good at this now, taps it safely away square"

146,"Hastings to Topley, no run length on off stump, Toppers blocks again"
147,"Hastings to Topley, no run goes wide on the crease, fires the ball in at 87mph, another metronomic half-forward defensive"
148,"Hastings to Topley, no run top of off, gets into line, straight bat again"
149,"Hastings to Topley, no run goes back and across, this time he plays away from his body and squirts the ball down to third man - but Rashid denies Topley a run in order to keep the strike"
150,"Agar to Rashid, no run tossed up on the stumps and swept backward of square, they elect not to run though"
151,"Agar to Rashid, 2 runs on the stumps and flicked with wristy insouciance through square leg, there's a couple in this"

154,"Agar to Rashid, 1 run tossed up wide of the stumps, walks out and punches a single out to deep extra cover"
155,"Agar to Topley, 1 leg bye drifts down the leg side, Topley misses with a glance but it rolls away off the pad... and they take the run this time, so Rashid obviously trusts him to face another over from Hastings"
156,"Hastings to Topley, no run length ball, steady as she goes, defended on the stumps"
157,"Hastings to Topley, 1 run short and wide and Topley wants a piece of that, slightly stiff-armed swipe and it goes over gully, down to third man on the bounce"

159,"Hastings to Rashid, 1 run bit of width, decides late to run the ball to third man"

163,"Agar to Rashid, FOUR runs orthodox this time, planting the foot and sweeping hard over square leg, bounces away four"
164,"Agar to Rashid, FOUR runs more tap from Rashid, skips out and clears mid-on, a clean swing through the line - this partnership is into the 30s"

166,"Agar to Topley, no run floated up on off, defended with the inside half of the bat"
167,"Agar to Topley, OUT pinned in front and that's all over, red rover! The simplest lbw decision of the day, Topley playing back to one that gripped a little and straightened on off stump, plumb as a pudding"
168,"1.10pm: It's been easy like Sunday morning for Australia and, since they've wrapped England up so quickly, they'll have a bat before luncheon is served. Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid played valiant hands but England couldn't recover from the loss of three early wickets and, more troublingly, Eoin Morgan"
169,"Well, here goes nothing. David Willey to Joe Burns"
170,"Willey to Burns, no run good length, nips back, hits the pad"
171,"Willey to Burns, no run angled across the right-hander, and Burns flirts outside off. Not a good shot but he survives"
172,"Willey to Burns, no run drawn forward, solid defence back down the track"
173,"Willey to Burns, no run outside off, lifting past the stumps. Left alone"
174,"Willey to Burns, no run forward again, uncomfortable defence to a tight line"

179,"Topley to Burns, no run forward and defended into the covers"
180,"Topley to Burns, no run pushed out to cover"

183,"Willey to Smith, no run outside off, swinging away, no stroke offered"
184,"Willey to Smith, 3 runs on the toes, turned to short midwicket, where two men were lurking for that very stroke. And somehow he bissected them both! Smith living dangerously"
185,"Willey to Finch, no run climbs into the splice from back of a length. Lots of intent so far from England, who are being backed by a vocal crowd"

192,"Topley to Smith, no run tidy swing from Topley, demanding an honest response"

195,"Willey to Smith, 1 wide outside off, tempting the loose drive, but too much width that time"

197,"Willey to Smith, no run tight wicket-to-wicket delivery. Defended"
198,"Willey to Smith, no run good areas, good areas. Smith bides his time as Willey targets the top of off"

201,"Willey to Smith, no run good finish to the over, joining the dots effectively"

206,"Topley to Smith, (no ball) 1 run short again, swished to backward square leg, and a free hit coming up ... not the ideal scenario for England"

226,"Willey to Finch, no run another maiden. Where's the hurry?"
227,"Wood to Bailey, FOUR runs not that way, it won't. Not much wrong with the ball but Bailey quickly onto the front foot and that is drilled through the gap"
