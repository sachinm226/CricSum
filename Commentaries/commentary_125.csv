216,"Shadab to Short, FOUR runs swept! And swept hard. Full on off, and down on one knee as he slaps this behind square. Asif in the deep tries to dive and intercept, but the ball wins the race. Asif crashes into the security guard near the ropes too"

218,"Usman Shinwari to Short, OUT back of a length outside off, and pulled to deep midwicket. But Shoaib Malik, yes that grand old man, runs to his left from long on and slides across the ground to take a mindblowing catch. He's 37, would you believe it? A"
219,"Usman Shinwari to Coulter-Nile, OUT Shadab runs from point and whips the bails off! It was a yorker on off that Coulter-Nile wedged to point. He wanted the run, but Tye wasn't interested, and the fielder has enough time to sprint towards the batsman's"

232,"Hasan Ali to Zampa, no run back of a length outside off, and the ball stays low due to the lack of pace. Zampa misses the pull as the ball goes under"
233,"Hasan Ali to Zampa, no run yorker on off, but shoveled away to towards the off side. Zampa is out of his crease, and Hasan races to his right and aims at the batsman's end. Misses!"
234,"Hasan Ali to Zampa, 1 run good length outside off, and pulled in front of square to deep midwicket"
235,"Hasan Ali to Tye, OUT nine down! Full and quick, and Tye's attempted drive takes the inside-edge and straight into Sarfraz's gloves. That went so fast, and the keeper had to dive to his left in a flash"

241,"Usman Shinwari to Lyon, 2 runs full on off, and he swings across the line to long on. Shoaib throws from the deep, and Lyon could be run-out, but the ball has hit his body. No appeal for obstruction because the batsman did not alter his running path"

244,"11.10pm So a poor finish to a disappointing tour for Australia. For Sarfraz, this is the right tonic after a slew of poor captaincy decisions cast doubts over his authority over the side in the lead-up to the tour. He responded with two superb knocks in the"
