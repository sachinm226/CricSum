Hussey pushed forward as a good length ball pitched in line and seamed across the left-hander. The ball went past the outside edge and hot-spot shows no sign of an edge.

181,"Morkel to Clarke, no run ooh, Clarke survives, another bouncer from Morkel, gets big on him, hits high on the bat, on the shoulder of the bat actually, the loops up, both the keeper and slip race forward towards the stumps to try take that but there was no way they could have got to it, Morkel grimaces, not much going South Africa's way"
182,"Morkel to Clarke, no run forward defence to the off side"
183,"Morkel to Clarke, FOUR runs that's more of the Clarke we say yesterday, Morkel pings it in short once more, Clarke swivels as he pulls that away towards the midwicket boundary, 229 for him now"

194,"Morkel to Siddle, no run a massive lbw appeal there, short of length ball angling in, Siddle isn't too keen to get forward, he's struck just over the knee roll in front of the stumps, that looked to be going over, South Africa of course have no more reviews so they can't do much after the umpire shakes his head at their appeal"

218,"Morkel to Siddle, 1 run pitched up, Siddle looks to power this past extra cover, it was in the air but lands short of Tahir, who gets his body behind it"
219,"Morkel to Wade, OUT Morkel strikes again, Wade hadn't scored in a while, he thought he could crash a length ball outside off through the cover, only gets a thin edge through to the keeper, Wade is distraught as he trudges off, knowing that there were some runs to be had on what remains a lovely batting track"

232,"Kleinveldt to Siddle, no run short of length ball angling in towards middle, solidly defended by Siddle"
233,"Kleinveldt to Siddle, OUT Kleindveldt gets his first Test wicket, or does he? the no-ball check, that is tight, many replays needed to check whether it is behind the line, looks to be safe by mere millimetres, he is, Kleinveldt can finally savour a Test wicket, Siddle gets a healthy nick through to slip, that was a back of a length ball, Siddle might have been better off playing off the front foot, he hangs back in the crease, so Australia"

288,And here's an Ask Steven column which answers the questions over the highest score made by a team with no one making double-digits. It's not NZ at Perth. Thanks to Mike for sending in the link.
289,"Not quite the continuation of the day one dominance that Australia fans were expecting. South Africa's main bowlers were a lot better today, with Steyn drying up the runs early on and Morkel bowling an incisive spell. Even before he ended Clarke's innings for 230, he had Clarke nearly caught-out fending at a bouncer. Enough has already been said about teams making 500-plus and still going on to lose at Adelaide, but despite the flat track and the"

It started in the morning where Morne Morkel and Co took out the six remaining Australian wickets early on to keep the home side to550, when 650 was on the cards. Then their captain, Graeme Smith, led the way with a century on a track which still has almost nothing in it for the quicks. Clearly, South Africa's day but it would have been an even be"
