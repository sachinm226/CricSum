0,"7.30pm Pakistan win the toss and choose to bat. Pakistan have made no changes to the side, that means they still have four spinners in the XI."

2,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run similar length closer to off stump this time, defended off the front foot in front of point"

4,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run massive appeal for lbw from Cummins as he gets one to swing sharply in, Hafeez is late to get his bat down and that thuds into his pads in front of middle and off, that looked pretty close, Hafeez lucky to survive"
5,"Cummins to Hafeez, FOUR runs this time the ball doesn't dip in, holds the line and a thick outside edge races down to the third man boundary"
6,"Cummins to Hafeez, FOUR runs reaches out for this one and crashes it uppishly past a diving point for the third boundary of the over, it has actually been a pretty good over from Cummins but he has been taken for 12, in what is expected to be a low-scoring game"
7,"Starc to Imran Nazir, no run Starc starts with a short of length ball well outside off, left alone, was just close enough to the stumps to not be declared a wide"
8,"Starc to Imran Nazir, 1 wide this time it is a wide, swinging down the leg side"
9,"Starc to Imran Nazir, OUT brilliant delivery from Starc, that one swung one and Nazir was clueless about it, through the bat and pad gap and it crashes into middle stump, what a start to Starc's international T20 career, a duck for Imran Nazir"

11,"Starc to Jamshed, no run closer to off this time, but still not close enough to force Jamshed to play"

75,"Cummins to Jamshed, no run back of a length ball on off stump, defended towards point for a single"
76,"Cummins to Jamshed, OUT sensational catch from Dan Christian, even he can't believe it, a massive grin on his face as he gets up after plucking that one-handed blinder, set to be a Youtube classic that, Jamshed scooped that one over mid-off, Christian had to back-pedal, he had plenty of ground to cover, he wasn't going to make it so he puts in a full-length dive and stretches out his left hand, it sticks,"

78,"Cummins to Kamran, 1 run"

110,"Cummins to Kamran, 1 run short of length and outside off, flays it towards third man, drops short of the fielder"
111,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run premeditated there, looking to glance that towards fine leg after moving across the stumps, too far outside off to pull that off"
112,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run short and wide, looks to uppercut that to third man, edged through on the bounce to the keeper, a run out chance of Wade could get the direct hit, the Akmal brothers aren't the best runners in cricket"
113,"Cummins to Kamran, 1 run slapped towards deep midwicket for a single"
114,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs anything Kamran can do, I can as well says Umar, he launches this over powerfully, inside-out over cover for four, 45 runs off 28 balls this partnership now"

120,"Christian to Kamran, 1 run slower bouncer down the leg side, fine leg was in the circle and Kamran will be disappointed at missing out, he just needed to place it past that fielder to get four, he can't beat that fielder though, Pakistan have reached 150"
121,"Christian to Abdul Razzaq, 1 run short of length, Razzaq went for an almighty heave, off the bottom of the bat, rolls down the track for a single, so Pakistan end on 151, looks a decent score that"
122,"That was thrilling stuff. Hafeez and Jamshed provided the base before Kamran Akmal provided the late fireworks. Australia's bowling was not at its best, too many full tosses and deliveries down the leg side, the fielding also wasn't at it's best though Dan Christian was at his best in the field. This match may be forgotten soon, but that catch will be remembered for years."

147,"Umar Gul to Watson, FOUR runs short from Gul, a terrific pull from Watson, gets plenty of power on it to send it towards the midwicket boundary, Umar Akmal trying to cut that off near the rope but it was too quick for him, even Dan Christian would have had a tough time stopping that"

212,"Umar Gul to Bailey, 1 run shortish once more, looks to pull that powerfully, mistimes it towards mid-on"

237,"Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, SIX runs oh my! he is nerveless with the bat here as well, a massive hit , a short of length ball heading down leg stump, that is a monster hit from Cukmmins that sends it over the wide long-on boundary, the scores are level, Australia coach Mickey Arthur loves that shot"
238,"Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, OUT it's a Superover, it wasn't the best final ball form Razzaq but it was good enough, a full toss on the pads, Cummins was looking to work that to the leg side, a leading edge that ballons towards mid-off, Imran Nazir and Umar Akmal both went for it, Nazir called for it, Umar backed away, Nazir takes it, Cummins wrings his hands in disappointment, this has been some game"
239,"Warner, Watson and Bailey are Australia's chosen batsmen. The Pakistan team has a long discussion over who will bowl. It will be Umar Gul. Ajmal was off the field for the final two overs or so, which I think means he can't bowl now, which explains the long discussion over who to choose."
