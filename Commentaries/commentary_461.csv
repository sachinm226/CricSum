2,"Doherty to Kallis, no run flighted, middle and leg, turns, hits the edge, wide of keeper"
3,"Doherty to Kallis, no run more turn, but this time Kallis has it under control, guiding it to point"
4,"Doherty to Kallis, 3 runs quicker, fuller, down the leg, Kallis is quick to paddle it delicately, past the keeper, to the right of fine leg"
5,"Doherty to Smith, no run tossed up outside off, closes the face on it, to midwicket"
6,"Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run full toss outside off, driven to long-off"

8,"Bollinger to Smith, no run jumps out, across, outside off, the ball is even wider, and beats the outside edge again"
9,"Bollinger to Smith, 1 run length ball outside off, crashes it to sweeper-cover to get to 50. He is feeling his way back to form, and the whole ground stands up and applauds. Smith takes time to acknowledge the support"
10,"Bollinger to Kallis, no run slower ball, outside off, looks to run it down, but early into the dab, bottom-edging it"
11,"Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run length ball, pushed to deepish mid-off for one"
12,"Doherty to Kallis, no run overpitched on off, pushed to cover"
13,"Doherty to Kallis, no run driven on the up, to extra cover"
14,"Doherty to Kallis, SIX runs this has got nothing to do with the way the ball is bowled. Kallis seemed t have made his mind he would hit a six over midwicket this ball. And he does. Goes on a knee, sweeps in front of square, a fullish ball, goes for a parallel and big six"
15,"Doherty to Kallis, FOUR runs this is slightly shorter, and grips and turns, but the outside edge beats both keeper and short third man"
16,"Doherty to Kallis, no run defended to cover this time"
17,"Doherty to Kallis, 1 run closes the face on this to take a single to square leg"
18,"Bollinger to Kallis, no run full and wide, driven straight to extra cover"
19,"Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of short midwicket"
20,"Bollinger to Smith, FOUR runs that's his fourth boundary between mid-off and extra cover. This is an extraordinary innings from Smith. Leaves the crease, makes room, sends it crashing between the two men"
21,"Bollinger to Smith, 1 run this short ball chases him as he backs away, but he still manages a single to deep square"
22,"Bollinger to Smith, no run good yorker, 141ks, in front of off and middle, he digs it out well"
23,"Doherty to Kallis, no run more turn, this is flat too, pitches in front off and breaks away, beats the edge"
24,"Doherty to Kallis, no run even more turn, flat again, on off and middle, beats the drive, misses the off stump by inches. A slight puff of dust too"
25,"Doherty to Kallis, no run short of a length, on off, stays back to defend"
26,"Doherty to Kallis, 1 run paddled away from well outside off, moves away from the strike. It should be easier for Smith to face the left-arm spinner, who will bring the ball into him"

28,"Doherty to Kallis, no run full, on off, hit back to the bowler"
29,"Smith to Smith, 4 byes beaten first ball. Smith is drawn out to play a really full delivery, misses it, but it goes between Haddin's legs. Nearly a yorker for him, so only a half chance for the stumping"

32,"Smith to Kallis, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
33,"Smith to Smith, OUT Smith reviews this, Steven that is. Graeme has once again tried that cute reverse-sweep, misses, Haddin and Steven go up immediately. Umpire says no. Smith reviews immediately. The replays suggest a tiny little noise noise as the ball passes the glove, but there is no visual confirmation in normal replays."
34,"Smith to Duminy, no run flighted outside off, Duminy is well outside off to defend it to cover"
35,"Doherty to Kallis, no run full, on off, defended off the front foot"
36,"Doherty to Kallis, no run short of a length, pushed to cover"
37,"Doherty to Kallis, 1 run, OUT more misjudgement from South Africa. After G Smith's too-cute-by-half reverse-sweep, Kallis has run himself out trying a cute second. Tries the paddle sweep, the top edge clears the keeper, but has hardly crossed the 30-yard circle. Clarke from slip runs back and fields and hits the stumps direct"

49,"Doherty to du Plessis, no run comes down the track, drives handsomely, can't beat cover"
50,"Doherty to du Plessis, FOUR runs more turn for Xman, this is flat and quick, takes the edge, and goes between keeper and slip. Fortunate runs"
51,"Doherty to du Plessis, no run nearly gets him again, slows this one down, Faff looks to play it to leg, gets a soft leading edge that goes nowhere"

55,"Smith to du Plessis, 1 run full, on the pad, clipped away for an easy single square on the on side"
56,"Smith to Duminy, no run lovely googly, Duminy has no clue about it and pushes forward, but what seems an edge has come off the back pad"
57,"Smith to Duminy, 1 run low full toss, swept away"
58,"Smith to du Plessis, 1 run turned around the corner for a single"
59,"Doherty to du Plessis, no run quick, full, on the pads, defended"
60,"Doherty to du Plessis, FOUR runs slower through the air, du Plessis comes down the track, right down to the pitch, drives it inside-out, and this time he also manages to beat cover"
61,"Doherty to du Plessis, no run slower through the air, pushes forward and efends"
62,"Doherty to du Plessis, no run flatter, quicker, pushed back to the bowler"
63,"Doherty to du Plessis, OUT he has walked past this one. This is superbly bowled. He jumps out of the crease again, Doherty gets a little bit of drift, a little of dip, which opens him up slightly. He is not close to the pitch now, and ends up feeling for the ball. It pitches one a length in front of leg, turns away, beats the"
64,"Doherty to Miller, 1 run moves across to the first ball he faces, sees it's short, stays back, and pushes it into the on side for a single"
65,"Smith to Miller, SIX runs Miller counterattacks. The second ball he faces. Comes down the track, right to the pitch of the ball, and smashes it for a parallel six over long-off"
66,"Smith to Miller, 1 run short on middle and leg, pulled away for one"
67,"Smith to Duminy, no run short of a length, middle and leg, defended to leg"
68,"Smith to Duminy, 4 byes We have a mystery bowler on our hands. Duminy Haddin and Clarke, all beaten. Full ball, outside off, goes straight on. Duminy misses the sweep. Haddin misses the collection. Clarke doesn't have enough time to get to his right"

75,"Doherty to Miller, no run length ball, on the pads, can't beat short fine leg"
76,"Doherty to Miller, no run Shaun George's first big decision in ODIs has been challenged. He has given Miller lbw. This is angled away, pitching appreciably outside off, then turns against the angle, seems to me to have hit him outside the line. George has given it, though. Hot Spot deliberates over an inside edge even before"

78,"Smith to Miller, no run short of a length, on off, defended back to the bowler"

88,"Cummins to Duminy, no run quick length ball, 144ks, no room, hits him high on the bat, comes back to him"
89,"Johnson to Miller, 3 wide and he bowls full and wide, well down the leg side, Haddin can't get there"
90,"Johnson to Miller, FOUR runs what a top shot, not so smart with the ball, though. He has a strong on-side field, and bowls a wide length ball. Smacked between cover and extra cover"

92,"Johnson to Duminy, 1 run slower ball, 125ks, driven with an open face, hands over the strike"

94,"Johnson to Miller, 4 leg byes poor bowling, full, wide down the leg side, and had Miller's pads not deflected this, Haddin would have been tested to keep it under five wides"
95,"Johnson to Miller, 2 runs yorker, middle and leg, squeezes it square, past short fine, comes back for two"
96,"Cummins to Duminy, 4 leg byes another leg-side wide has been intercepted by the pads, but the deflection beats short fine leg to go to the fence"
97,"Cummins to Duminy, 1 run short of a length, on pads, nudged away to bring up the 200 in the 37th over, which on a dry turner is a threatening score"
98,"Cummins to Miller, FOUR runs Miller is playing a blinder here. Length ball, outside off, uses every yard of Cummins's pace to beat third man who is back but a touch too wide"
99,"Cummins to Miller, 2 runs slower short ball, pulled square of deep square, comes back for two. A happy Sunday afternoon crowd is loving this"

101,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run gets a bottom edge on this, the ball hasn't left the pitch, but Duminy calls him through for a stolen single"

104,"Johnson to Duminy, no run short and wide, cut away, can't beat point"
105,"Johnson to Duminy, 1 run good delivery, though, short getting big on him, but Johnson has missed another run-out. Miller pushes for a single as this rolls to Haddin, but Johnson is not back to collect the throw. Duminy is still going to end up short as Johnson goes to his left to collect the underarm from Haddin. The momentum"

142,"Cummins to Duminy, FOUR runs no one is going to save this edge from going for four. He looks to go inside-out with this length ball, gets a thick edge, and it flies well fine of third man for Duminy's first four"
143,"Cummins to Duminy, FOUR runs the extra slow bouncer, outside leg, would have been a wide had he not got enough bat on it to beat Haddin and short fine leg"

168,"Bollinger to Boucher, FOUR runs this time Boucher goes with the angle and down the ground, and benefits. This is a length ball outside off, he drives it on the up, along the ground, and between Bollinger and mid-off. So that wide ends up costing them five"

175,"Cummins to Duminy, SIX runs He has found the roof of St George's Park. That landed on tin with a loud thud. Length ball from Cummins, 137ks, Duminy clears the front leg, and lofts it straight over his head. What clean sensible striking here. reaches fifty too"

177,"Bollinger to Duminy, 2 runs yorker, middle and leg, squeezed out to long-on, and they are lightning quick to take the second to bring up the 300. The crowd has gone berserk"
178,"Bollinger to Duminy, OUT he has hit the full toss straight down Smith's throat at midwicket. Smith doesn't realise it is a catch, and wants to throw at the non-striker's end. He has a surprised look on his face as neither the non-striker wants to run nor the bowler wants the throw. I think Smith was ready in case it is called"

181,"Bollinger to Botha, 1 run slogged away on the leg side, along the ground, for a single"
182,"Four fifties for South Africa, and 303 looks like a really good total on what is a dry pitch. Australia looked a bit rattled in the field, but they have the batting fire power to chase down totals. I am not sure if Watson will be allowed to open, or bat with a runner. I am not sure Australia will want to risk a major injury just for"

190,"Tsotsobe to Ponting, no run gets behind the line this time, punches it to cover"
191,"Tsotsobe to Ponting, FOUR runs short at 128ks. Ponting of the old would have sent this into the Indian Ocean. Ponting of the new pulls it over midwicket for four"

195,"Steyn to Warner, no run crisply driven square, but can't beat Duminy at point"
196,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs slower ball, 122ks, still it flies off the bat. He just meets it with an open face, and extreme speed has been generated on the ball. It goes between cover and extra cover"
197,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs Pummelled. Brutal. This fast and short, and Warner loves them. It comes at 145ks, and is pulled at an immeasurably quicker pace"
198,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs slower ball, he is early into the shot, but manages to get it over point. Tsotsobe runs around from third man and puts the dive in, but can't stop four"
199,"Steyn to Warner, no run slower ball again, 123ks, hit to short cover this time"
200,"Steyn to Warner, no run Warner shapes up for the pull, but decides this is slightly too full for the pull. Punches this to mid-on"
201,"Tsotsobe to Ponting, 1 run length ball, pushed to mid-off with soft hands"

204,"Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run full, on the pads, driven wide of mid-on for one"
205,"Tsotsobe to Ponting, OUT du Plessis is claiming a low catch at cover-point. Ponting is not moving. This is short, angling away, game for cut, but the tennis-ball bounce means it comes slower and higher. Ponting ends up hitting uppishly and in front of square. Replays show he has been taken. Clean as a whistel, low in front of"

208,"Morkel to Warner, 1 run pushed wide of mid-on for one"

218,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, no room, defended to cover"
219,"Morkel to Clarke, OUT Morne Morkel bowls a beauty. They say hit the top of off, Morne bowls just by top of off. You can't do much more than defend these balls. Clarke plays for the angle, but misjudges the angle and gets the edge. Graeme Smith's bucket hands at first slip do the rest"
220,"Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, defended back to the bowler"

223,"Morkel to Hussey, no run short of a length, middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
224,"Morkel to Hussey, no run good bouncer, 140ks, around middle and off, seams away a touch, Hussey shapes up for the pull, and then pulls out"
225,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run Reviewed. Boucher has initiated this. And this seems like a good call to me. I heard a woody sound as the ball passed down the leg sound. Boucher heard that too, and convinced Amla to go for it. Replays, though, show it hit the pad, and was nowhere near the bat. However, the sound was woody"
226,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, outside off, punched square to point"
227,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run length ball, outside off, pushed back to Tsotsobe"
228,"Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run slower ball, nearly caught. Warner attacks it, hits uppishly towards mid-on, Amla takes a couple of steps in, but it bounces well in front of him. However, he manages to get his sliding body behind it, and concedes just one"
229,"Tsotsobe to Hussey, 1 run cut away hard, falls a few yards short of third man"

235,"Morkel to Hussey, no run short of a length, on off, pushed to cover"
236,"Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, pushed to cover, belts out a call of no"
237,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run Dropped. A sitter too. Slower ball again, hit loopily to Amal at mid-on. Chest-high. He grabs at in front of his body. Spilled. Lonwabo can't even swear. It's the captain"

239,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run anther length ball, no room, pushed back to Tsotsobe"
240,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, punched down to mid-off"
241,"Tsotsobe to Warner, no run another slower ball driven uppishly, this falls well short of mid-off"
242,"Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run driven to midwicket, through his legs it goes. Been an over of sloppy fielding"
243,"Morkel to Warner, 1 leg bye that"
244,"Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, driven with open face, straight to cover-point"
245,"Morkel to Hussey, FOUR runs lovely shot, he has been hitting straight to cover, but this time he waits an extra half second to make sure he beats the man to his right. It was a wide ball asking for it"
246,"Morkel to Hussey, no run on a length, on off, pushed with an open face"
247,"Morkel to Hussey, 1 run bouncer, quick one, Hussey goes for the pull, mis-hits it down towards square leg"
248,"Morkel to Warner, no run that's strange. I don't think I have ever seen this happen before. Bouncer down the leg side. Looks like a wide, but Warner pulls. Hits the back of the bat, lobs, and falls well short of slip"
249,"Botha to Hussey, no run no turn on the first ball, beats the inside edge, belts out an appeal. Even Boucher is not interested as this is going down leg"
250,"Botha to Hussey, no run quick, on off, pushed to cover"
251,"Botha to Hussey, no run slows this one down, tosses it up, gets bug turn from outside off, beats the outside edge this time"

263,"Botha to Hussey, 1 run flat, outside off, cut away to sweeper-cover"
264,"Botha to Warner, no run slightly short of a length, tries to cut, finds Amla at point, which means the skipper has moved out of slip. It's Kallis now at slip"
265,"Botha to Warner, 1 run cut away to deep backward point for one"
266,"Botha to Hussey, no run the arm ball, nearly gets his man, but the inside edge saves him"

268,"Kallis to Hussey, no run length, on the pads, pushed back to Kallis"

270,"Kallis to Hussey, no run more good work in the field. This time it's Duminy diving full length to his right at backward point. That's four saved because it was cut powerfully"

272,"Kallis to Hussey, 1 run this is quick, and he has run this down to third man for one"
273,"Botha to Hussey, no run arm ball again, on off, angling in, defended off the back foot"
274,"Botha to Hussey, no run missed stumping. Sees him come down, fires it into the pads at 91ks, the ball squeezes between Hussey and leg stump, but it's too quick for Bouhcer, who is hit on the pad"
275,"Botha to Hussey, 1 run pushed to long-on for one"
276,"Botha to Warner, FOUR runs Warner finally hits another boundary, slog-sweeping this full ball over midwicket"

290,"Steyn to Hussey, 1 leg bye slower ball again, on a length, on the pads, concedes a leg-bye"
291,"Kallis to Hussey, FOUR runs short-arm pull, crisp crunchy connection, over midwicket. After overs of trying to pull he finally gets one that is short enough, and lays into it"

310,"Duminy to Hussey, 1 run pushed wide of midwicket for one"
311,"Duminy to Warner, 1 run driven to long-off to bring up his fifty. It has been a responsible innings after that big fiery start. A quiet applause, and a quiet reception"

327,"Botha to Hussey, no run short of a length, stays low, hit to cover"
328,"Botha to Hussey, no run that's a second stumping missed by Boucher. In fact it is an action replay of the earlier one. Hussey leaves the crease, the full ball passes between Hussey and the stumps. Boucher doesn't gather it. Missed on 18 and 36. Watch out when he is 54"
329,"Botha to Hussey, 1 run pushed past midwicket for one"
330,"Botha to Warner, 2 runs full, angling in, pushed wide of deep square, and they pinch the second"

336,"Duminy to Warner, 1 run driven to sweeper-cover for one"
337,"Duminy to Hussey, OUT Hussey is gone. He has run himself out. Botha has had Hussey missed twice off his bowling, but this time his rocket arm gets rid of the man. Deflected fine off the pads, Hussey wants one, rightly sent back, and even though he has taken about four steps down the wicket, he can't make it bat. Comprehensive"

355,"Botha to Smith, 1 run turns in towards the pad,s worked away for a single"
356,"Botha to Warner, no run Botha belts out a big appeal after bowling the one that goes straight with the arm. The bat and pad are close together, there is bat involved for sure, but Botha appeals for pad first. Umpire George doesn't think so"
357,"Morkel to Smith, no run starts off with a full ball outside off, defended to cover"
358,"Morkel to Smith, no run that's a beaut from Morkel. Short of a length, outside off, holds its line, beats the edge, bounces in front of Boucher"

364,"Botha to Warner, 2 runs angling into the pads, played with soft hands, just a nudge into the on side, where all men are at the fence. Makes an easy couple to reach his ODI best"

369,"Morkel to Smith, 1 run short of a length, punched away to deep cover for one"
370,"Morkel to Warner, 2 runs slightly short, pulled wide of long-on, where Amla fields. They take the second, Morkel is not quite by the stumps to collect the throw. Would have been very close had he done so"
371,"Morkel to Warner, OUT just too much pressure of the asking rate I suppose. And Morkel is not the bowler you can have your way with. This time the bounce gets a touch big, Warner's pull generates a hefty top edge, Boucher goes back towards short fine leg, and catches this swirling ball over his shoulder. Had to drag this pull"
372,"Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover"
373,"Morkel to Smith, 1 run short, this is not nasty, and is pulled away to deep square for one"

382,"Kallis to Smith, 1 run slow again, on off, this time he gets just the single to short fine"
383,"Kallis to Watson, SIX runs Beware the wounded batsman lads. Kallis digs this in short, never mind that Watson is forward, he clubs this for a flat six over square leg"
384,"Kallis to Watson, FOUR runs Slower ball, Watson sees it early, Watson plants the big front foot down, and slogs this over midwicket. Now fun is coming"
385,"Kallis to Watson, 1 run slower ball, but too full to get under, so he drives it along the ground to long-on"
386,"Kallis to Smith, no run makes room to drive this square, can't beat backward point"

393,"Tsotsobe to Watson, OUT and on cue Tsotsobe strikes, and that's the game. Slower ball, 118ks, on a length, middle and leg, Watson clears the front leg to go over cow corner, is early into the shot, and ends up dragging it straight to deep square. They all surround Lopsy"
394,"Tsotsobe to Smith, 1 run another slower ball, 116ks, hit uppishly, to the right of straight extra cover"

408,"Tsotsobe to Smith, 3 runs for an agonising little moment it seemed Smith had hit hi first boundary by walking across and flicking this past short fine. Botha, though, from deep square gives it a big chase, and throws itself at it to save one run"
409,"Tsotsobe to Haddin, 1 run this one stops at him, driven uppishly to mid-off"
410,"Tsotsobe to Smith, no run slower offcutter, beats Smith as he backs away to try and hit it over cover"

Full toss outside off, drives with an open face, Duminy catches it at point, and hands it over to the leg umpire, who at the moment is at point because the left-hand batsman is on strike.
