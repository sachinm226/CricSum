0,"Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger"
1,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there"
2,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover"
3,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot"
4,"Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot"
5,"Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg"
6,"McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath"
7,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly"
8,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run right in the channel there, absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward, rather tentatively, defending it back to McGrath"
9,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run and McGrath is in once again, chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot"
10,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser"
11,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off"
12,"Tait to Kemp, 1 leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down - but it's a little too straight and worked off his pads"
13,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips - not far off at all"
14,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more"
15,"Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness"
16,"Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance"
17,"Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended"
18,"Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact"
19,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg"
20,"Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip"
21,"Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot"
22,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket"
23,"Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest"
24,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg"
25,"Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover"
26,"Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler"
27,"Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover"
28,"Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg"
29,"Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler"
30,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run quick, on middle-and-leg and it's worked further to leg"
31,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner"
32,"Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot"
33,"Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover"
34,"Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile"

36,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square"
37,"Watson to Gibbs, no run better"
38,"Watson to Gibbs, no run good idea from Watson, who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk, bouncing the batsman...but he's pretty settled now, ducking underneath it easily"
39,"Watson to Gibbs, no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not?"
40,"Watson to Gibbs, 1 run calmly strokes past short extra cover"
41,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run on middle-and-off, Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends"
42,"Hogg to Kemp, 2 runs poor ball outside leg, deftly paddled around the corner"
43,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run very well played again, straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner"
44,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run flicked through midwicket"
45,"Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot"
46,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA"
47,"Watson to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot"
48,"Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover"
49,"Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone"
50,"Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field"
51,"Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot"
52,"Watson to Kemp, no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it's blocked out"
53,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single"
54,"Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out"
55,"Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out"
56,"Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there"
57,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended"
58,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably"
59,"Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there"
60,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball, on the money, and that's defended forward"
61,"Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge"
62,"Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time"
63,"Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership"
64,"Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers"
65,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square"
66,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square"
67,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run the one that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily"
68,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run another ball on leg, another sweep, this one dinked as gentle as the others"
69,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on middle, doesn't read that one, and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point"
70,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide"
71,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square"
72,"Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right"
73,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away"
74,"Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers"
75,"Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body"
76,"Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region"
77,"Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again"
78,"Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball"
79,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable"
80,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it"
81,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide"
82,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time"
83,"Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot"
84,"Tait to Kemp, no run outside off and that's swished at off the back foot. Little foot movement, his turn to borrow the team glue"
85,"Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time"
86,"Tait to Kemp, FOUR runs on leg and that's tucked tidily round off the hips, very fine, through fine leg. Awful ball, got the treatment"
87,"Tait to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot"
88,"Tait to Kemp, 1 wide down leg and that's accurately called wide"
89,"Tait to Kemp, no run slightly slower ball, up there, and that's defended down"
90,"Hogg to Pollock, no run on off and Pollock gets his body over that one, defending it forward"
91,"Hogg to Pollock, FOUR runs touch of room and Pollock waits for that, and cuts it away off the back foot through cover. Lovely shot, bringing up the hundred en route too, note you"
92,"Hogg to Pollock, no run on off and that's defended down off the back foot"
93,"Hogg to Pollock, OUT awkward shot, checking his off-drive and that's chipped back to the bowler whose clasping fingers accept that fly-trap-style"
94,"Hogg to Nel, no run ooh, Nel pops up a catch into the vacant short-leg area. He's such a tease"
95,"Hogg to Nel, no run Hogg gets his revenge, Nel's got no idea what to do that with that and settles for poking a bat at it and it fizzes past his edge. Nel smiles, his tongue popping out, too"
96,"McGrath to Kemp, 1 run a touch of width, very unMcGrathian, and that's worked away to the off-side sweeper"
97,"McGrath to Nel, no run poor Nel's a bit at sea here and there's more poking and missing"
98,"McGrath to Nel, no run left alone outside off"
99,"McGrath to Nel, no run"
100,"McGrath to Nel, no run outside off, short, and Nel gamely has a slash at that one off the back foot, looking to send it to Row Z over covers. It doesn't even make blade of grass A off the wicket, as he misses it completely"
101,"McGrath to Nel, 2 runs sent high over midwicket, it lands safe and McGrath's hands fly to his hip as if there should be fielders everywhere"
102,"Hogg to Kemp, no run stroked tamely, like patting a dog, off the back foot into the leg0side off the back foot"
103,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 leg bye on leg and that's tucked without much power off the thighs and into square leg"

111,"McGrath to Kemp, no run slower ball and that one just, just leaps over middle stick and there's another fresh-air swipe"
112,"McGrath to Kemp, 1 run a hint of room which is enough to be guided behind point and leave Nel exposed"
113,"McGrath to Nel, no run right up there and, like a great exclusive, that's well dug out"
114,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time"
115,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept round behind square and out towards the boundary where the sweeper fulfils his job description"

119,"Hogg to Nel, no run defended forward"
120,"Watson to Kemp, no run up there and that's defended into the covers"
121,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs outside off, just a touch of width and that's a very good shot indeed, that one cut away off the back foot with a mere flick of the wrists"
122,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run width again, but only a mere hint"
123,"Watson to Nel, FOUR runs on off, a touch short, and that's pulled round with a delightful pirouette behind square"

125,"Watson to Kemp, no run opens the face but can only run that one to gully"
126,"Hogg to Nel, no run right up there, awkward to deal with, and Nel pokes that one down"
127,"Hogg to Nel, no run comes forward, a deliberate yet clunky stride, and that's defended into the covers"
128,"Hogg to Nel, no run outside off and that's cut down - the ball just died a touch on him, this pitch is pretty slow"
129,"Hogg to Nel, no run oh, attempted flipper, and that's a big call from the Aussies, a better one from the umpires"
130,"Hogg to Nel, no run defended forward"
131,"Hogg to Nel, no run outside off, veering down, and that's tucked to point off the back foot"
132,"Tait to Kemp, no run on a length outside off and that nips back in, defended down"
133,"Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait flies into bowl, that lovely rhythm ending in a muscly delivery as ever - but all that effort goes to waste as this one is wide down off"
134,"Tait to Kemp, 1 run changed his angle of approach ever so slightly, that's right up there on the money but poked forward for a quick single"
135,"Tait to Nel, no run too quick for Nel who, like a spotty boy in a disco, aims a desperate - and futile - lunge at that one"
136,"Tait to Nel, 1 wide wide down off"
137,"Tait to Nel, no run outside off and that's poked into the ground at the last minute - Nel again not really dealing with the pace"

141,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run poked forward and there's a quick single"
142,"Watson to Nel, no run a quick would-be single into the midwicket region and Nel and Kemp both set off, then have to dive to make their ground. Nel finds the whole thing hilarious"
143,"Watson to Nel, no run dinked into the leg side"
144,"Watson to Nel, no run lowish full toss - thigh height - and Nel deals well with the approaching weapon, defending that down without much fuss"
145,"Watson to Nel, no run in the blockhole, but Nel doesn't block, rather he drives back to the bowler on the bounce, who snaps at it, gets his right hand on it and parries the ball into the ground"

148,"Tait to Nel, no run on leg, slower delivery, and that's prodded into mid-on"
149,"Tait to Nel, no run attempted bouncer, doesn't lift as much as he would expected, chest height nonetheless and that kicks through down the channel"

151,"Tait to Nel, no run driven forward and that rounds off another stifling over"
152,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run up there and driven forward, straight, without much power"
153,"Watson to Nel, 1 leg bye speared in on leg, dinked into short cover, and there's a shy and a miss at the non-striker's end"
154,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run low full toss, driven out to straight midwicket where Ponting does well to dive and take the pace off the ball with a left-hand grasp. It's tidied up further out"

156,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run driven forward and there's another single"
157,"Watson to Nel, 1 run bouncer, and another single up ... and down to third man"
158,"Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot"
159,"Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath"
160,"Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time"
161,"Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward"
162,"Tait to Kemp, no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone"
163,"Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided"

169,"Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head"
170,"Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block"

180,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover"
181,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball but Kemp can't find the single he needs, leaving Langeveldt exposed"
182,"Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake"
183,"Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it"
184,"Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was"
185,"Tait to Pollock, 1 run bouncer crashes into Pollock's gloves at just-crouching height - Pollock did well to shield his body there, but he's not looking comfortable"
186,"Tait to Kemp, no run plays that away from his body, poking it down to gully off the back foot"

193,"Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball"

204,"That's South Africa's lowest score in the World Cup and Australia bounce off the field. On TV they are still pretending this game is well and truly alive, but the reality is that it will take something remarkable to prevent Australia reaching the final now."
205,"Lubna Kabir reckons you don't need a bar for some places in the States - instead, Indian restaurants frequented by Indian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Pakistani taxi drivers should do it - in Boston, DC and Philly for sure."
206,A quick note - these suggestions are from readers and we in no way endorse them or vouch for the accuracy of the information.
207,"1.00pm Various readers have answered questions as to where the final will be shown in the USA. NY/NJ -Cafe Spice in Jersey City has been showing all World Cup matches, and Galaxy Cinema, Raleigh, NC is showing all the games, and Eight Mile Creek, an Aussie bar/restaurant on Mulberry St ... and also Ship of Fools on 2nd Ave at 82nd ... Boston - Tommy Doyle's in Harvard Square,"
208,"1.25pm That's the public service broadcast over. Hope it helps. We are still not aware of anywhere in Miami and there have been loads of requests from there, so shout if you can help."
209,"Welcome back all. It is I, Will, here for another 10 over stint - which ought to be just enough time for Australia to knock off these 150 runs. Well nearly, anyway. I'm just finishing off my Ploughmans (cheddar, for the cheese freaks among you) and we're about five minutes away from starting. Damn smoking police. Anyway, hope our pub crawl information proved useful. If you do"
210,"For those in Florida Churchill's Pub off 2nd Ave in Miami will show the World Cup...or at least it ought to, suggests Frank, who watched the Ashes from there."
211,"Sad news has just come in from Cricinfo's obituary expert, Martin, who tells us Arthur Milton has died."
212,Pollock to open (the bowling. Obviously. He hasn't defected to Australia). Blustery out there which could help him. Let's face it; South Africa need all the assistance they can get
213,"Pollock to Gilchrist, no run on off stump, a good length and it's defended"
214,"Pollock to Gilchrist, no run a well-timed defensive push back to the bowler"
215,"Pollock to Gilchrist, 1 run Pollocks drifts this one down the leg side and Gilchrist nobbles it off his pads for a bye"
216,"Pollock to Hayden, no run short and wide, Hayden's eyes light up and he cracks it straight to short extra cover"
217,"Pollock to Hayden, no run Pollock roars for no apparent reason, probably just felt like it, and Hayden defends this off the back foot"
218,"Langeveldt to Ponting, 1 wide well he got a bit too excited there, Langeveldt. Short, wobbling down Ponting's leg side who attempted to pull before realising there was no need"
219,"Langeveldt to Ponting, no run and that'll be another wide this time outside the off stump. But no, Aleem Dar thinks about it but decides it's just within the limitations"
220,"Langeveldt to Ponting, no run again very wide and much too short from Langeveldt, allowing Ponting to crack it off the back foot into the covers"
221,"Langeveldt to Ponting, no run ah, there's the length"

225,"Pollock to Hayden, no run far too wide from Pollock who is very fortunate not to be clattered for at least four"

227,"Pollock to Hayden, no run just short of a length, Hayden cuts it to cover but again can't break the gap"

229,"Pollock to Hayden, no run and he finishes the over well, dead-eye straight and Hayden works it to leg but can't get a single"
230,"Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs and he's dropped. Ponting pulls, with immense power, and Prince at short midwicket dives to his right to attempt to pull off one of the tournament's most brilliant catches...but can only get a fingertip to it. Such was the force if Ponting's stroke that it still went for four"
231,"Langeveldt to Ponting, (no ball) cracked off the back foot to cover"
232,"Langeveldt to Ponting, no run good line, here, Ponting pushing it off the back foot"
233,"Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs shot, Ponting, pulling this shorter delivery quite beautifully through midwicket - in front of square, too"
234,"Langeveldt to Ponting, no run ah, good comeback from Langeveldt, the former prison officer, forcing Ponting to defend on the front foot. That's the length"

236,"Pollock to Hayden, no run cut to point"
237,"Pollock to Hayden, 3 runs oh but he's off the mark now. Hayden's had enough of this block-prod-block malarkey, picking up this half volley and dispatching it over midwicket for four. Not pretty, but very Hayden-esque"
238,"Pollock to Ponting, 1 run that's a terrific line from Pollock, on off stump and Ponting pushes it just past the bowler - immediately Ponting sets off for a run, and gets it, much to Pollock's disgust"
239,"Pollock to Hayden, no run a squirted, smudged yet purposeful inside edge to mid-on"
240,"Pollock to Hayden, no run good length just outside off and Hayden is resolute in defence"

242,"Kallis to Ponting, no run a touch too wide but a good length, Ponting defends off the back foot back to Kallis"
243,"Kallis to Ponting, no run too straight from Kallis, on Ponting's middle stump and he flicks his wrists to midwicket, setting off for a single before Hayden sends him back"
244,"Kallis to Ponting, no run another big stride down the pitch from Ponting, creaming it to cover. He looks in absurd touch"
245,"Kallis to Ponting, no run good length, just drawing Ponting forward - at good pace, too - and Ponting cracks it on the front foot, opening the face of the bat, to Gibbs at point"
246,"Kallis to Ponting, no run driven to extra cover"
247,"Kallis to Ponting, no run a textbook cover drive, but straight to mid-off"
248,"Nel to Hayden, no run and it's defended off the back foot"
249,"Nel to Hayden, 1 run banged in short, but it's down the leg side and Hayden works it down to fine-leg. Nel falls over in his follow-through, as he so often does"
250,"Nel to Ponting, FOUR runs terrible ball, a massive wide which Ponting just leans into, stroking it through cover, bisecting mid-off and cover, and it races for four. Absolutely no chance of stopping that"
251,"Nel to Ponting, 1 run ooh that's better from Nel, a tighter line which forces Ponting to defend...though it's padded away and they pick up a single"
252,"Nel to Hayden, 1 run but it's too straight, Nel not able to adjust his line and Hayden clips a single to leg"
253,"Nel to Ponting, no run driven to mid-off"
254,"Kallis to Hayden, 1 wide good bounce from Kallis but, oh dear, it's very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not-so-wide umpire"
255,"Kallis to Hayden, no run ooh and a play-and-a-miss outside off - fuller this time from Kallis and Hayden tries to late cut, but the ball kept a touch low"
256,"Kallis to Hayden, no run crunched on the front foot to cover"
257,"Kallis to Hayden, no run hammered! My word, he very nearly killed short extra cover. Andrew Hall the fielder there"
258,"Kallis to Hayden, FOUR runs grief, that is some shot from Hayden. No great foot movement, flicked on the up through mid-on for four. Extraordinary shot in fact"
259,"Kallis to Hayden, 1 run pushed to mid-off this time and he sets off for a single"
260,"Kallis to Ponting, no run worked to leg but no single on offer"
261,"Nel to Hayden, no run defended on the front foot"
262,"Nel to Hayden, no run just a touch wide, giving Hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but Hall does magnificently to prevent the single. Or the two, three or indeed four"
263,"Nel to Hayden, no run tighter line and a fuller length which Hayden back-cuts to point"
264,"Nel to Hayden, 3 runs on leg stump, Hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket. But the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble, allowing them through for two. Hall is not pleased, and the stump mic picks up every word"
265,"Nel to Ponting, 1 wide wide of the off stump, left alone...but it's a wide"
266,"Nel to Ponting, no run down on one knee, Ponting carves it to cover"
267,"Kallis to Hayden, 1 run swinging into Hayden who works it through midwicket"
268,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 leg bye drifting down Clarke's leg side and he works it off his pads"

271,"Kallis to Hayden, no run timed off the back foot to extra cover"
272,"Kallis to Hayden, no run Hayden pulls but, for once, can't get hold of it"
273,"Nel to Clarke, no run shuffled through, bustling effort, but that's just left alone outside off - Clarke with all the time in the world (cue Louis Armstrong song music)"
274,"Nel to Clarke, no run more leaving"
275,"Nel to Clarke, no run a bit of wobble and no dobble as that one nips back in and that's defended forward"
276,"Nel to Clarke, no run more leaving this time, that one outside off"
277,"Nel to Clarke, FOUR runs nice shot to get off the mark, leaning into that one outside off on the front foot and Nel's furious with himself"
278,"Nel to Clarke, no run outside off and that's just defended forward"
279,"Kallis to Hayden, 2 runs over the wicket, by the way, that's poked into the covers for a quick single and there's a very close shy from ABCdEV... ooh. Overthrows result"
280,"Kallis to Hayden, 1 run dabbed out off the back foot out to deep point where it's winged back in without much fuss"
281,"Kallis to Clarke, no run left alone outside off"
282,"Kallis to Clarke, no run hostile bouncer, Kallis finding some spring there with one which whistles past the grille. Good bouncing, there"

284,"Nel to Hayden, 1 run driven straight to long-off"
285,"Nel to Clarke, no run outside off and Clarke launches into a cover-drive but he doesn't time it very well at all"

290,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 run just to say strays onto leg and that's tucked into square"
291,"Kallis to Hayden, 4 leg byes outside leg, that would have been good to a righthander, but he's a lefty, of course, and that's pawed round through fine leg"
292,"Kallis to Hayden, no run a touch of width outside off, Hayden connects cleanly and cuts that to gully"
293,"Kallis to Hayden, 1 run quick single to mid-off"
294,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 run on leg and that's tucked forward with some excellent placement in front of midwicket - Hayden turned down the second"
295,"Kallis to Hayden, (no ball) 1 run on off and Hayden fails to pull that cleanly in front of square - ah, an overstepped no-ball is signalled - and he rehearses the shot when he makes it to the non-striker's end"
296,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 run on leg, bounces up and that's tucked into short midwicket"
297,"Nel to Clarke, no run left alone outside off"
298,"Nel to Clarke, no run a touch of width outside off and that's cut to point"
299,"Nel to Clarke, no run outside off, short, and Nel's really pleased with himself, jogging through and laughing like Muttley. Clarke goes to play and then drops his hands at the last minute"
