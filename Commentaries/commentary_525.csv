5,"Steyn to Marsh, 4 leg byes now an appeal, as Steyn pitches in line and straightens the ball, Marsh doesn't move forward much and neither does he play much of a shot, the ball strikes him just outside off stump and was doing too much as well, then it clips his pad ans runs away through the slips, whi"
6,"Steyn to Marsh, no run on the stumps and he keeps the last ball of the over out"
7,"Ntini to Warner, 1 run and he's off the mark first ball, easing forward and dabbing into cover"

9,"Ntini to Marsh, no run now he makes Marsh play, and he drives the ball straight to mid-off"

25,"Steyn to Warner, OUT lovely delivery, pitching short of a length in line with the stumps and nipping off the upright seam, cramping and squaring up Warner, with no foot movement, and the half-hearted shot towards the on side draws a faint edge through to Boucher, and thus Warner fails on his ODI debut"

615,"Well folks, its been a terrific match. We will just get you the Man of the Match."
616,"At one stage it appeared that Australia would have only themselves to blame. They were 1 for 131 half way through their innings, and 300 was on the cards. Even after half-centurions Marsh and Ponting departed in relative succession, surely Australia should have got 280 from there. But South Africa took five"
617,"What fun. Australia look relieved. South Africa look miffed. Hilfenhaus bowled a tidy last over, despite the six, but he can credit plenty to that man Bracken. The players all shake hands. This was a tense match. Hats off to Australia. South Africa, like the home side earlier in the day, simply lost steam."
