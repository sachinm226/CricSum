59,"Agar to Mahmudullah, 2 runs dropped! At first slip by Turner. Full outside off, and he slashes a drive. Takes the edge, past the keeper's pad and to Turner's left. Gets a hand to it, but it pops out. Tough chance, but good luck telling a bowler that"

64,"Tye to Mahmudullah, no run full outside off, and he checks a drive. Hits the bat and goes to cover. A knuckleball, the replays confirm"

Misses after stretching forward. And Wade grabs the ball, then keeps an eye on the batter's feet. Notices Mahmudullah is slow to drag his boot back over he line, and whips it off. But replays show Mahmudullah managed to"

75,"Hazlewood to Mahmudullah, OUT Henriques, you beauty! And that's Hazlewood's second. Knuckle ball, full on middle. Comes down the ground to clear long off, but through the shot too early.

83,"Zampa to Shakib, FOUR runs full on off. Comes down the ground, and drags a shot to long on. Fielder runs in, dives forward to take the catch, but it falls just in front of him.

89,"Tye to Shakib, 1 run full and wide outside off. Throws his hands at this, and slaps it uppishly to deep cover. Carey runs in to take a catch, but he's late to react, running towards cover instead of coming in. Changes direction late, and the ball falls in front of him"

105,"Starc to Afif, no run top delivery! Follows him and delivers a ripper of a yorker, dug back. Starc runs across and underarm flicks, a direct hit would've had Afif"
106,"Starc to Afif, 1 wide Wade saves five wides with a full-length dive to his right. This was a full toss that perhaps slipped out of his hand, way down leg"

125,"7.45pm Bangladesh have huffed and puffed their way to a score they'd be disappointed with. Shakib held the innings together but couldn't kick on. Bangladesh needed someone to kick the innings into overdrive but couldn't find anyone to do the finisher's job. The spoils were equally shared by the five Australian bowlers. Starc, Hazlewood and Zampa were particularly impressive."
126,"Welcome back to the chase. Australia favourites to take the 1-0 lead, unless the spinners make a web around them and the two left-arm seamers can make some impact up front. Alex Carey and Josh Philippe are out there. We'll start with offspin, however, here's Mahedi Hasan."

135,"Nasum to Philippe, OUT Caught or stumped? Either way, he's outta here! Tossed up, wide outside off and Philippe comes down the wicket and goes for an inside out cover drive. Turns away sharply, but Philippe is way outside his crease as he misses the shot. Through to Nurul, who whips the bails off, and Philippe isn't even waiting for the decision. Replays say that's not caught, but stumped."

219,"Nasum to Starc, 1 run eased down to long-off"
220,"Nasum to Turner, no run have they got him? Superb work behind the stumps as Nasum gets this to spin across the face of the bat to beat Turner. Did he drag his back foot inside the crease? Looks like he just made it in time. Good work from Nurul nonetheless"
221,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, no run slower length ball outside off, can't hit it past cover"
222,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, FOUR runs takes him on with the hook, and it flies off the top-edge, one bounce to the fine leg boundary"
223,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, no run beaten as he backs away to scythe that over the infield"
224,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, 1 run mistimes the heave to deep midwicket"
225,"Shoriful Islam to Turner, 1 run gently tucks it into the leg side for a quick single"
226,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, 3 runs the short fine leg fielder makes a right royal mess as he fails to account for the ball spinning sway, Shakib comes around to mop up. Starc didn't get pace on the ball to work with"
227,"Mustafizur to Starc, 1 run heaved into the leg side to deep midwicket"
228,"Mustafizur to Turner, FOUR runs drilled down the ground to beat long-off. This was right in the slot, Turner held his shape and went hard at it"

233,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, 1 wide beaten as he tries to wait, wait, wait and then drill this slower ball over the infield. Way outside his hitting range"
234,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, 1 run hit hard to long-off"
235,"Shoriful Islam to Zampa, no run beaten by this cutter off a length, played too early"
236,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, no run defends this slower delivery back. Slightly uppish but doesn't carry"

242,"Mustafizur to Hazlewood, 1 run backs away and toe-ends a hit to cover"
243,"Australia never looked in control of this chase at any point, not even when Mitch Marsh appeared to be revving up. You always got a sense that he was one mishit away."
244,"9.35pm Bangladesh have walked home in style! They'd have been the first ones to admit to being at least 20 short but boy, have they not made 132 look 172? Incredible effort. Australia choked against spin and Bangladesh's plethora of slow deliveries on what was a challenging surface."
