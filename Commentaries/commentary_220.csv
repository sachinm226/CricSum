0,"9.30am Some team news before the toss. Australia have rung the changes and named two debutants in the same match, with Joe Mennie and Chris Tremain becoming ODI players No.215 and No.216. And talking of the toss, Steve Smith has won the toss and will bowl first."
1,"Tremain to de Kock, no run decent pace, outside off, and squirted to point off a fat outside edge. Decent start"
2,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run decent area once again as de Kock rocks back into the crease to flick his first single through the leg side"
3,"Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs lovely timing! Really not a lot wrong with that delivery, full, tight, a hint of swing back into the left-hander. But Rossouw's timing picks up where it left off at Centurion. Whistles through midwicket"
4,"Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs the outfield is lightning quick as this one is punched from under the eyeline into the covers"
5,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run forward and defended to mid-off"
6,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run up onto the toes, defended back down the pitch. Not a bad maiden over. But it's not a maiden over. If you see what I did there"
7,"Mennie to de Kock, no run good delivery, shaping from leg to off on a good line and length. Defended"
8,"Mennie to de Kock, 1 run on the pads, flicked hard to the sweeper behind square"
9,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs spanked! That was an over-pitched outswinging half-volley, and Rossouw drills it with a big stride, an elegant knee-bend and a whoomph of bat"
10,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs good riposte! A genuine lifter from a full, tight length. Takes a fat edge and eludes Smith, diving to his left at a solitary slip"
11,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run lifting off a good length again, and defended with one hand"
12,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run calmly defended into the off-side, where a misfield gifts an extra single. Whoops. The outfield didn't help there, to be fair"
13,"Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs short and wide, I'm afraid that's rubbish in any format. Rossouw frees his hands and flings an uppercut four over backward point"
14,"Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs better line and length, but that's some lovely timing through the covers, and the outfield is so quick it's as if the ball has been given an armed escort to the boundary as the fielder sprints to stay level with it"
15,"Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs hauled into the leg side, the pressure's on for the debutants"
16,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run round the wicket, and that's a fine delivery. Kicks off the turf and beats the outside edge"
17,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run a crunching cut into the off side but can't pierce the infield this time"
18,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run on the back foot, drilled hard into the covers"
19,"Mennie to de Kock, no run onto the front foot, pushed to the off side"
20,"Mennie to de Kock, 2 runs poor delivery once again, curling into the pads which is never a good idea against de Kock. Fierce timing through the leg side but a fine diving stop to save the four"
21,"Mennie to de Kock, no run defended into the off side"
22,"Mennie to de Kock, no run forward to defend back down the track"
23,"Mennie to de Kock, FOUR runs lovely strike, full face, pummelled down the ground"
24,"Mennie to de Kock, 2 runs on the pads again, whipped hard through midwicket and an instant call of two. South Africa are cooking"
25,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run tight line, lifting off the deck, defended to the off side"
26,"Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs power, placement and not even the pretence of a jog down the track, That was four from the moment it was flogged dismissively on the up through the covers"
27,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run tighter to off stump and a bit of nibble off the pitch. Well bowled"
28,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run well bowled again, round the wicket and on that perfect length that is never quite there to drive or defend. Nips through the gate but past the stumps"
29,"Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs tremendous ball-striking, just a fraction too full and met with a lashing blade, hitting straight through the line, working against the inswing to pound it through the covers"
30,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run another decent comeback but beats the edge to no avail"
31,"Mennie to de Kock, 1 run punched on the up through point"
32,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run left well, almost a Test-match moment there. Line and length from the bowler, and respect from the batsman"
33,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run full and probing, right in the blockhole"
34,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run this is turning into a good over, another tight and attacking delivery, good length and curling towards the off stump"

37,"Tremain to de Kock, no run fully forward and well stopped in the followthrough"
38,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run round the wicket, punched on the up to cover"
39,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run speared in towards the toes, defended from deep in the crease"
40,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run high elbow action as Rossouw attempts to drive a full-length ball straight back past the bowler. Mid-on tidies up"
41,"Tremain to Rossouw, no run settling well into this over now, wider on the crease from round the wicket and defended to the off side"
42,"Tremain to Rossouw, 1 run fuller and drilled hard back down the track, where the non-striker's stumps act as a 12th fielder"
43,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run angled defence into the off side"
44,"Mennie to de Kock, 1 run width, and flashed through third man"
45,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs crunched on the up through the covers once again. That has been a bread-and-butter stroke for Rossouw in the past 48 hours"
46,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run tighter line, solid defence"
47,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run patted out to cover"
48,"Mennie to de Kock, no run good bowling once again, no width to work with, as the bowler fields in his followthrough"
49,"Hastings to Rossouw, no run undercut out to point, the shot was on but the execution was lacking for a change"
50,"Hastings to Rossouw, FOUR runs that's impeccable. Just a fraction short, and slammed on the up through the covers once again. The timing is sensational"
51,"Hastings to Rossouw, FOUR runs too much width, and Rossouw flings the sink at it, outside off. Takes a fat flying edge and fizzes over the cordon through third man"
52,"Hastings to Rossouw, no run that's better, tighter line and length, and defended"
53,"Hastings to Rossouw, no run opens the face, and attempts a glide through third man. But point pounces"

55,"Mennie to de Kock, no run clipped off the straight and narrow, out to the leg side"
56,"Mennie to de Kock, FOUR runs stunning placement through the covers once again. Just dobbed on a spankable length outside off, no lateral movement on offer, save that of a thumping piece of willow swinging through the line"
57,"Mennie to de Kock, no run nudged into the leg side"
58,"Mennie to de Kock, 2 runs too much width, but it works in the circumstances, as de Kock doesn't quite read the slower ball. Deep point gathers"
59,"Mennie to de Kock, 1 run full and dabbed into the leg side"
60,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run outside off, lifting through to the keeper with some extra zip. That's a good finish"
61,"Hastings to de Kock, 1 run dabbed into the off side and more sharp running"
62,"Hastings to Rossouw, 1 run outside off, driven on the up through the covers"
63,"Hastings to de Kock, 1 run another dabbed single behind square on the off side"
64,"Hastings to Rossouw, 1 run a bit of an inside edge on this one as Hastings probes a tight line"
65,"Hastings to de Kock, no run too much width but Warner at point is on hand to intercept a lashing cut. Lucky let-off"
66,"Hastings to de Kock, OUT a big heave down the ground, it looks elegant enough, but he's not middled it at all! Right off the toe, a gentle back-pedal at mid-on, and Australia have the breakthrough!"
67,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run tight defence on off stump"
68,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run extra bounce, defended with the bottom hand coming loose from the handle"
69,"Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run driven into the covers, du Plessis scampers the single into the covers, and wears the shy from Aaron Finch on his wrist as he makes his ground! He looks seriously discomforted by that ... he put his hand up to defend himself as the throw came in, and was struck flush on the thumb. Ouch"
70,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run patted into the covers as Marsh finds some extra bounce"
71,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run round the wicket, probing line and length, Rossouw tightens up in defence"
72,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run that's a good finish to the over. Tight angled delivery into the left-hander, forcing a respectful defensive prod from a very well-set batsman"
73,"Hastings to du Plessis, 1 run lifting into the splice and deflected to the leg side"
74,"Hastings to Rossouw, no run defended into the off side, more constrictive work from round the wicket"

77,"Hastings to du Plessis, no run back of a length, defended into the off side, as Australia begin to settle into a strong spell of seam bowling"

82,"Marsh to du Plessis, no run defended into the off side, more tight bowling"
83,"Marsh to du Plessis, FOUR runs there we go, the dam finally breaks as this one offers up just a hint too much width, and du Plessis pushes with an open face through third man"

85,"Hastings to Rossouw, no run round the wicket, defended out to cover"
86,"Hastings to Rossouw, 2 runs down the track, a bit of ambition in that footwork, as the ball is filleted down to third man. Think he's bored of being hemmed in"
87,"Hastings to Rossouw, 1 run chopped into the off side, not a lot of finesse, but finds enough of a gap to steal the single"
88,"Hastings to du Plessis, no run outside off, du Plessis hops across his stumps to drive into the covers"
89,"Hastings to du Plessis, FOUR runs fetch that! Du Plessis uses his feet this time, trusting the surface and exploiting the field. Into position early and a flog through the line, over extra cover"

95,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run cut hard into the off side, and another scampered single"

97,"Zampa to Rossouw, no run tosses one up from over the wicket, Rossouw leans out and defends, like a dog sniffing a nettle"

108,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run one the walk, tucks the ball down into the on side, Rossouw is looking for one but the ball goes straight to Marsh... who misfields it, with the stumps unguarded! Could have been a real chance, that. Not sure where Rossouw was going"

131,"Mennie to du Plessis, 1 run slightly back of a length, stays on the back foot and punches to the cover sweeper"
132,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs woof, that's an umpire killer! Pitched up, 134kph and it disappears back a few clicks quicker, I'd wager, hammered through the line and Nigel Llong throws himself overboard as Mennie glances back to see the ball thump into the boards"
133,"Mennie to Rossouw, 2 runs on the body, nudged through the leg side and into a gap for two"

144,"Tremain to Rossouw, 1 run round the wicket, pitched up and clipped down the ground to long-on"
145,"Tremain to du Plessis, FOUR runs more tap for the new boys, a stiff-armed jab down the ground, du Plessis strolling out and crunching a straight drive through the line, Stevie Smith gives valiant chase and goes barreling into the rope but can't prevent a boundary"
146,"Hastings to Rossouw, OUT shortish and Rossouw pulls, sends it swirling into the Joburg atmosphere - taken at deep square leg! Not the most calculated of risks, looked like a long boundary out that direction and it was well short of carrying, Hastings again the bowler to strike.

155,"Tremain to Duminy, 1 run over the wicket to the left-hander, pitched up and driven through the covers to get going"

182,"Head to Duminy, FOUR runs flighted, definitely some turn for Head this time, takes the outside edge as Duminy pushes at it, but he got enough on the ball to send it wide of Wade's gloves and running fine for four more"

225,"Zampa to Duminy, 1 run clobbered into the deep where Warner does well to gather and release in double-quick time"
226,"Marsh to Duminy, FOUR runs no cutting that one off! Width outside off, and walloped high and handsome over the cover field. South Africa are putting the hammer down"
227,"Marsh to Duminy, no run tighter line, patted into the covers"
228,"Marsh to Duminy, no run tight line on off stump from round the wicket. Defended"
229,"Marsh to Duminy, no run outside off, dabbed into the covers, good response to that early-over flogging"
230,"Marsh to Duminy, 1 run nudged into the leg side"
231,"Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run works the gap to keep the strike"
232,"Hastings to Miller, FOUR runs whoops, a low full-toss outside off, that's asking for trouble. Miller wallops it for a one-bounce four through wide long-on"
233,"Hastings to Miller, OUT chopped hard out to point, and a tumbling stop ... in fact, it's a catch! Zampa reacted so calmly that no-one really noticed it was out. The umpires are taking a look, and lo and behold, the ball buried in his breadbasket! Time is called on Miller Time..."

235,"Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 run outside off, dabbed out to point"
236,"Hastings to Parnell, 1 run outside off, tapped into the gap"
237,"Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 run on the pads, worked square for another single. Lucky's first run for South Africa!"
238,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs pounded down the ground for a three-bounce four through long-off! Cleared the front leg to batter a length delivery"
239,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run stunning followthrough, reminiscent of Darren Gough's backside-slapping strokeplay at Sydney in 1994-95, but no contact this time"
240,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs he has absolutely battered this one! In the slot, and picks the slower ball as well. Timing, power, placement. Into the stands over the bowler's head!"
241,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run another murderous wipe through the line, but connects with nothing but air! I have hit upon a new favourite tailend batsman..."
242,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, 1 run short and wide, if he'd left it he'd have had another go at it, for sure. But instead he toe-ended it down to deep point"
243,"Tremain to Parnell, no run slower ball, well disguised, through to the keeper"
244,"1.45pm So, that's the end of that. Australia will need 362 to square the series, thanks to an imposing allround batting effort, led by the captain, Faf du Plessis, with Rilee Rossouw and JP Duminy in fine form as well. Back shortly for the chase"
245,"Ahoy there, shall we do this? Aaron Finch is scratching his mark and preparing to give it some humpty as Australia seek to chase down what would be a record targets for them in ODIs. Dale Steyn won't be giving anything away easily, though..."
246,"Steyn to Finch, no run that's a ripper to start with, leaping like an electrocuted trout off a length, Finch looked startled as he dropped the hands and the ball boomed into the keeper's gloves"
247,"Steyn to Finch, no run fullish, tight line of off stump, gets bat on it this time and blocks to cover"
248,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run draws him forward, reaching for the ball away from his body as it seams a fraction, keeps it down in front of point and an diving stop keeps them to one"
249,"Steyn to Warner, no run oof, takes this in the midriff, at 144kph, too! Slightly short and David Warner's first ball has him hopping around the crease"

251,"Steyn to Finch, no run cripes, another jaffa to finish with, fired in and then zipping away off a length, this close to Finch's outside edge"
252,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run angled across and dabbed down behind square on the off side"
253,"Rabada to Warner, no run beats the outside edge, that's a snorting ball, too. Warner hung bat and swished, so close to nicking off"
254,"Rabada to Warner, 1 leg bye Rabada's burning rubber with these wheels, 146kph and hitting the pads, possibly too high and the ball flies to slip... whose throw is then tipped past midwicket by Rabada in his follow through, gifting a single"
255,"Rabada to Smith, no run unplayable! That went straight through Smith as he tried to defend on off stump, just did enough off the deck at a sizzling speed"
256,"Rabada to Smith, no run angled in and holding its line, 144kph and past the outside edge again. This is going to be quite a test"
257,"Steyn to Warner, no run dug in short and Warner tries to tuck to leg, bottom-edges just past his stumps, I think"

263,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run back of a length, good pace again but calmly worked off the body for one"

268,"Rabada to Warner, 1 wide dug in short, climbing through above Warner... called on height"
269,"Rabada to Warner, no run fires to ball in full, serious heat at 148kph and Warner has to jam his bat down on it"
270,"Steyn to Smith, no run touch short outside off and Smith leaps into line and effects a gunslinger's pose as he attempt to flay another square drive but picks out the fielder"

277,"Rabada to Warner, no run shortish and angled across on off, Warner jabs it away"

280,"Rabada to Warner, no run Rabada puts it on a length, middle and leg stump at 142kph, worked towards mid-on"
281,"Rabada to Warner, no run the change-up works this time, an offcutter deceives Warner, who inside-edges on to his body"
282,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs short ball, looked to have hurried him... but Warner still manages to bludgeon it through midwicket for four, pulled off the splice of the bat but it outruns the fielder"
283,"Steyn to Smith, OUT fired down leg, thick inside edge... WHADDACATCH!!! Steyn gets Smith, though he has de Kock to thank, he flew to his left to hold the chance one-handed, before tumbling and rising in delight to be mobbed by his team-mates. Smiffy's gotta go, via to a worldie from Quinny"
284,"Steyn to Bailey, 1 wide welcomes the new man with a bumper, Bailey bails out early... too high"

294,"Rabada to Bailey, no run fullish, outside off, reaches for the drive and inside-edges to leg"

302,"Rabada to Warner, 1 wide short and slightly leg side, Warner flicks and misses"
303,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs stand and deliver, crashed through the covers, though Rossouw nearly pulls off a screamer diving to his right! It was in the air was quite a way, between two fielders and then skittering away to the rope - that's the 50 up"
304,"Rabada to Warner, no run on the stumps and pushed into the off side"
305,"Rabada to Warner, no run shortish and this beats Warner on the inside, maybe clips the edge before thudding into the pads"
306,"Rabada to Warner, no run back of a length, pushed across and Warner comes forward to block"
307,"Rabada to Warner, no run pinned in front, that stayed low... but umpire Llong walks away! After some deliberation, SA ask for the review. They desperately want to get rid of Warner, but this won't be the ball, as it pitched well outside leg stump. Looked like it would have been fuller, given the height at which it went through"
308,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run length ball outside off, 144kph and punched on the up into the covers"

The pressure was building on Bailey and he went for the big shot, aiming down the ground but it wasn't quite there, seamed a fraction and he played around it as Parnell hit the bull's eye. Parnell then starts dabbing in celebration... that or he's short-circuiting"
315,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run short ball, worked off the hips for a single"
316,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run back of a length on off stump, poked into the covers"
317,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs doesn't take long for Marsh to open up, offered a modicum of width and he mows a drive through backward point to get off the mark with a boundary"
318,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs oh, that's even better, too full from Phehlukwayo and Marsh pings a supremely timed drive back past mid-on"

331,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up outside the line of off, leans into a prod to cover"
332,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run pushed through a bit quicker, Marsh stays back and jabs to the left of extra cover, could have been tight if the pick up was clean"
333,"Parnell to Marsh, FOUR runs dug in, slightly leg side and Marsh gets some glove on the pull, sends it wide of de Kock and that'll be four"

345,"Parnell to Head, no run zinger! Outside off, exploding off the deck, and drawing a rather startled jab from the new batsman. Pace and bounce, all the attributes"

347,"Parnell to Head, no run fiery work again as Parnell whistles another one through to the keeper, a touch of movement away from the left-hander"

356,"Parnell to Warner, 1 run tapped into the off side"
357,"Parnell to Head, 2 runs firmly drilled off the back foot, but that's some sure-footed fielding from Imran Tahir at third man, cutting off a whistling stroke and tumbling to keep it in play"
358,"Parnell to Head, no run tight defence on the back foot"
359,"Parnell to Head, 1 run lashed down to backward point, and once again a forceful stroke is under-rewarded. Still, the hundred is up"
360,"Parnell to Warner, no run wicket to wicket, tapped to point"

363,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run outside off, crashing back-cut but straight to the man at backward point"
364,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run opens the face in a attempted glide, but can't find the angle"
365,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run full length, pushing Warner right back onto his stumps. Tidy work"
366,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, FOUR runs a bit of width and this time Warner finds the gap in the covers, and the boundary too, as the man in the deep makes an utter horlicks of the attempted gather, lets it through his feet and onto the rope!"
367,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, SIX runs panned high and hard into the stands! Warner isn't giving up the chase just yet! Shorter this time, and climbed alarmingly off the seam, but he was on the back foot and ready to give it everything. Shot. And suddenly a fine over goes for four, six!"
