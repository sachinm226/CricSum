3,"Maxwell to Zaman, 1 leg bye chance of a run out! But he can't get the direct hit. Carey has a shy at it, but alas for Australia. Full on leg, and Fakhar missed a sweep.

24,"Coulter-Nile to Zaman, OUT backs away, but misses! Coulter-Nile thinks there's an edge. The bowler is convinced, Carey not so much, but Finch reviews anyway.

195,"Shadab to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up on the stumps, turning. Worked away to midwicket"
196,"Shadab to Marsh, OUT Big appeal for caught behind by Sarfraz and given Mitch Marsh didn't look too happy, but perhaps that was because he's out - he hasn't reviewed. Classical leg-break, pitching on middle and off and turning away, drawing his bat away from body. Thin edge through and Sarf knew it immediate"
197,"Shadab to Carey, 1 run Goes for the sweep, gets a top edge that balloons over the keeper and goes very fine. Short third man is there though"

201,"Hafeez to Carey, OUT Collapse time again? Leading edge, and it flies to the man at extra cover for an easy catch. Tried to work this ball on leg-stump through the leg-side, but closes the face too early. The ball turns enough to take a thick edge. Australia in big trouble"

204,"Hafeez to Maxwell, 1 run on middle and turning, clipped to deep square leg off the back foot"
205,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, no run yorker from around the wicket, it looped up off the toe-end. Hung in the air for a while, but mid-on didn't dive for it. He perhaps thought it was a bump ball"
206,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, FOUR runs he gets enough bat on it to pull it fine. Wasn't entirely in control, back of a length on off and not rising much, but he got it fine enough to run to the boundary"
207,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, 3 runs dropped Maxwell toe-ended a drive off a slower one that went sky-high.

214,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, clubbed to long-on. Maxwell wanted two, but was rightly sent back. Even then he had to scramble to get back"
215,"Hasan Ali to Coulter-Nile, no run big appeal for caught behind and referred there was a definite noise when the ball went past the bat. But that noise, incredibly is from the ball hitting the stumps! How did the bail stay put? It didn't just shave the stumps, but made an appreciable noise."
216,"Hasan Ali to Coulter-Nile, no run full ball, driven from the crease to cover"
217,"Hasan Ali to Coulter-Nile, no run yorker at 141 clicks homing in on the toes, and goes through the batsman, but well wide of leg-stump"

228,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 2 runs misfield by Imad clubbed to cover, and Pakistan just getting a bit ragged. That went through him and Hafeez cleaned up"

246,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, OUT is that the match for Pakistan? Maxwell got it off the toe-end and it went miles in the air. Shoaib Malik at long-on kept calm, settled in under it and clutched it to his chest. No chance of the ball popping out. Maxwell's entertaining knock ends. And you'd think so do Au"
