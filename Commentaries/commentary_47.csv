58,"Sundar to Smith, FOUR runs sliced inside out over backward point! That is salt into the wound. Smith gets a life and punishes the next one"
59,"Sundar to Smith, 2 runs full on leg, he dances down and works this to the gap at midwicket"
60,"Sundar to Smith, OUT clean bowled! Rahul is relieved! Lovely delivery. Tossed higher and slower outside off, Smith gives room to try and loft to the short boundary at cover, he is deceived in flight and it clips the top of off."

67,"Natarajan to Wade, no run pretty full, Natarajan brings this one back into Wade, this is something he has been working on in the recent years, has Wade falling over the flick. Hits the front pad. Not given out lbw. Has that straightened enough to attack leg stump? India call for a review. Or have India been timed out? Looks like, and Kohli has a word with the umpire. And guess what?"
68,"Natarajan to Wade, 1 run low full-toss, sliding into the pads, picked off to deep midwicket"
69,"Natarajan to Maxwell, no run mighty full on middle, not quite a yorker, Maxwell stabs it out to cover"

79,"Chahal to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell brings out the reverse-hit. Maxwell jumps across, Chahal pushes it wide of off, swats it over backward point for four"
80,"Chahal to Maxwell, 3 runs and the reverse-hit again. Maxwell does not connect well, but gets enough bat onto it to clear Natarajan over short fine leg"
81,"Chahal to Wade, 1 run looks like a wrong'un, on a length, dropped to cover for one"
82,"Chahal to Maxwell, (no ball) Rahul makes no mistake this time as he tracks down this skier. Chahal shifts his line wider once again, hits a heavy length. Maxwell aims to haul it over midwicket. He can only top-edge it to Rahul. Okay, hang on, Chahal has overstepped"

84,"Thakur to Wade, 1 run full and outside off, punched down to long-off"

89,"Thakur to Wade, no run slower short ball outside off, plinked to the covers off the back foot"
90,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run tossed outside off, Maxwell drops down to one knee and slog-sweeps on the bounce to deep midwicket"

94,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run Chahal loses his line again, another off-side wide"

96,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run Rahul belts out an appeal for caught behind. Not given out. Chahal isn't convinced, but India still go for a review and they take it on time. Maxwell aims for a reverse-sweep, darted flatter and wider of off. Nothing on Hotspot. No spike on Snicko either. The original decision is upheld"

103,"Thakur to Maxwell, no run Thakur thinks he has Maxwell caught behind. With one second to go, Kohli calls for the review. Maxwell searches for the reverse-hit, this is the slower variation from Thakur - possibly a knuckle ball. No bat involved once again. Maxwell is good to go"
104,"Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length and wider, Maxwell reaches out and scythes it wide of Iyer at sweeper"
105,"Thakur to Wade, 2 runs full and straight, whipped to Chahar at deep midwicket"
106,"Thakur to Wade, 1 run on a length and on off stump, offcutter, nurdled through the leg side"
107,"Thakur to Maxwell, 2 runs Chahar runs in from sweeper cover and drops it! Sloppy stuff from India. Full and outside off, Maxwell aims to launch it over extra-cover, instead he slices it squarer. Chahar runs in and spills it"
108,"Thakur to Maxwell, SIX runs Whoa! Outrageous strike from Maxwell. This is a slower length ball outside off, Maxwell jumps across off, manufactures his own pace and smites it over the midwicket boundary - like only he can"

115,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run on a length and outside off, offcutter, swished to sweeper cover"
116,"Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run fullish and outside off, cross-seam, Maxwell jumps across off, aims for the shorter leg-side fence, leading-edges it down to third man instead"
117,"Thakur to Wade, OUT slower dipper from Thakur and Wade has been given out lbw. The batsman sweeps early, the ball plunges sharply and hits him on the boot in line with the stumps. Wade has reviewed almost immediately. Has he nicked it then? Nope, and ball-tracking returns three reads. Wade goes for a career-best 80 off 53 balls"
118,"Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs cross-seamer, 113ks, steps out and carves to sweeper cover. Washington runs in, but the ball carroms away from him into the fence"

122,"Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT Natarajan aims for the yorker, but it comes out as a full-toss. Maxwell shuffles across, looks to reverse-swat it away, but misses it altogether in the end. Natarajan messes with the stumps once again"
123,"Natarajan to Short, 2 runs Short shuffles across and gives the left-armer the charge, Natarajan shifts his lines wider, sliced to deep third man"
124,"Natarajan to Short, FOUR runs full and outside off, drilled through the line, placed to the right of sweeper cover as Samson slides in vain in the outfield"
125,"Natarajan to Short, 1 run, OUT full-toss, but it is still a hard-to-hit full-toss, punched down towards long-on. Short comes back for the second - which isn't quite there - and is caught short despite a full-length dive. Nice, flat throw from the deep"
126,"Natarajan to Sams, FOUR runs Natarajan aims for the yorker, Sams, batting outside his crease, stretches out further and squeezes it through the covers for four"
127,"Natarajan to Sams, no run Sams backs away outside leg, Natarajan pulls his length back and shifts his line wider to beat the swinging bat"
128,"9pm A career-best 80 from Wade and some Maxwell magic has lifted Australia to 186. India were sloppy in the field, dropping multiple catches, but Natarajan and Thakur were impressive with their variations in the end overs, reining Australia in. Have Australia got enough to avoid a 3-0 sweep? Alex will be back in a bit to launch the chase."
129,9.17pm The players are heading back out. KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan are opening up. Can they run this down again? They would like their chances given what they did on Sunday.

139,"Abbott to Kohli, 2 runs 130kph, back of a length, this climbs, Kohli does well controlling a guided late cut fine of third man. He got on top of the bounce"
