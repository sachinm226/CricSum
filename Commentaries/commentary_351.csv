0,"7.32pm Bangladesh big favourites to go up 2-0 in this series. If it was spinners that caused damage yesterday, today it was the fast bowlers who used their cutters really well. Marsh impressed once again, on a surface that is tough, yes, but one that can't be used as an excuse to brush away the way the middle and lower-middle order fell apart. A marginally better but overall disappointing effort from the openers. Wade failed to get going, Turner and Agar fell prey to the pacers' skills, and if"
1,Water break. Fairly humid out there.
2,"Zampa to Nurul, no run full on middle. Big stride forward to defend"
3,"Zampa to Nurul, FOUR runs crunched! Short on off and turning away. Stands tall, doesn't commit early, and slaps a shot over the fielder at cover! Pierces the gap between extra cover and long off"
4,"Zampa to Nurul, no run full on off, and googly turns in. Bat-pad to the leg side"
5,"Zampa to Nurul, 1 run driven through the off side to wide long off for one"
6,"Zampa to Afif, no run full outside off, and the googly turns across. Misses the drive"
7,"Zampa to Afif, no run full on off stump. Defended to the off side. And that's Zampa done for the night"
8,"Tye to Nurul, 1 run good length, outside off. Nudged to third man for one"
9,"Tye to Afif, 1 wide back of a length, outside leg stump. Walks across to pull towards fine leg but misses. Gets the wide though"
10,"Tye to Afif, no run good length, on leg stump. Defended towards the off side"
11,"Tye to Afif, FOUR runs lofted! And we're into single digits now. Knuckle ball, on middle, and hammered over mid on for four"
12,"Tye to Afif, FOUR runs over the vacant slip cordon! Back of a length on leg and angling across. Not in control but he ramps it from close to his chest for four. Quite a thick edge"
13,"Tye to Afif, no run good length angling across. Misses the cut"
14,"Tye to Afif, no run full, on off. Slower one. Pushed to point with the angled bat"
15,"Hazlewood to Nurul, 1 run good length, just outside off. Hammers a pull to deep backward square leg"
16,"Hazlewood to Afif, no run good length ball around the stumps. Tries to cut, but whizzes past the edge to the keeper"
17,"Hazlewood to Afif, no run fullish, just outside off stump. Tapped towards backward point for one"
18,"Hazlewood to Afif, FOUR runs back of a length, outside off stump. Sticks the bat out, ramps it over the keeper and Bangladesh have won by 5 wickets!"
19,"9.30pm A fist pump between the two youngsters who have dragged Bangladesh out of a very deep hole. Even Justin Langer is applauding them. A lone fan is flying the flag on a nearly building's roof. Imagine if we had a full crowd today! The partnership is unbeaten on 56.... to win from 67/5 with Australia's bowlers roaring, it needed a special effort."
20,"The high-adrenaline chase wil make Afif and Nurul heroes this evening, but don't forget the bowling effort. To restrict Australia to 121 is massive, and credit for that goes to Mustafizur and Shoriful firstly, along with the ever consistent spinners."
21,Presentation coming up.
22,"That's all from myself Sreshth, Andrew McGlashan and Ranjith P. Remember there's plenty of cricket happening. England v India and the Hundred. Hop over there to enjoy more cricket. See you!"
