His bat is well over the line but it's bounced in the air, are his gloves back in time? I don't think they are and indeed he's gone. Very unlucky that is for Morgan, the bat bounced up and all the way to the top of the handle was in the air as he crossed the whitewash. Top work from Hodge having run to his left"
