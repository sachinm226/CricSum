4,"Zampa to Dilshan, no run Zampa whirls down a slider now, Dilshan jabs and is beaten past the outside edge. Wade whips the bails off. TV umpire called in. Dilshan's back foot never left the ground. Easy call for umpire Gough"
5,"Zampa to Dilshan, 1 run Zampa lobs a full toss on middle, Dilshan punches it down the ground for one"
6,"Henriques to Dilshan, OUT The Dilscoop goes awry for Dilshan. Not a happy return for the old pro. Henriques finds some extra bounce outside off, which foils Dilshan's shot. And the ball isn't coming on here. He top-edges it, hit the helmet, and ballooned in the air. Smith runs in from point and settles under the catch"
7,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run full at of stump, played back to the bowler"
8,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run Henriques slips in a cutter outside off, finds extra bounce from the parched surface. Chandimal hops, gets on top of it, and runs it down to third man"
9,"Henriques to Mendis, no run short and some with outside off, rocks back and cuts firmly to Smith at point"
10,"Henriques to Mendis, 1 run full and on the stumps, forward and pushed down the ground. Mid-off runs to his right and throws himself on the ground to cut that off"
11,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run lobs a full toss on off, Chandimal could have latched onto it. Instead, he simply taps it to extra-cover"

16,"Zampa to Mendis, 2 runs slides on middle and leg, Mendis unleashes a slog-sweep, but Finch at deep midwicket hunts it down"
17,"Zampa to Mendis, no run an appeal for lbw, umpire Martinesz does not budge. Smith chats with Zampa and calls for a review. Pushed through on leg stump, pitches in line, no turn, beats the inside edge. Mendis plays across the line, against this straight delivery, and misses. Was that heading down leg? Hitting the outside of the leg stump. Umpire's call on review, and Australia's review amounts to nothing"

21,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run short on middle, rides the bounce, and helps it through backward square leg"

24,"Zampa to Mendis, 2 runs flatter on middle and leg, straight ball, sweeps it away behind square leg. Finch runs to his right and swats the ball into the field of play with a slide, even as he touched the ad boards"

32,"Faulkner to Mendis, 1 run looks like a cutter from Faulkner, slices an outside edge through cover"
33,"Faulkner to Chandimal, no run this explodes from a length and surprises Chandi. Was that the back of the hand slower ball? No he rolls his fingers across it. From the front of the hand. Pitches on middle and kicks at Chandi. Pings the glove and rolls to leg"

42,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run length ball on off, Mendis presses forward and bunts it down towards mid-off"
43,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run dies a couple of centimetres in front of Bailey at short extra cover. Faulkner has his hands on his head. Faulkner sucks pace off this outside off, Mendis searches for a leg-side flick, plays early. The front edge does not carry despite Bailey throwing himself in front"
44,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run length and outside off, eased to point"
45,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run front of the hand cutter outside off, grips in the surface, and leaves Mendis. Beaten past the outside edge"
46,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run looks like another slower ball, poked down the ground"
47,"Faulkner to Mendis, FOUR runs full on leg stump, Mendis attempts another pick-up shot. Lofts the ball over from midwicket. Head chases the ball manfully but only comes second in the race. He couldn't flick the ball back into the field of play"

49,"Zampa to Mendis, no run full and outside off, punched to extra cover"

51,"Zampa to Mendis, 2 runs tossed up, full on middle, goes for the slog-sweep and miscues it in the air. Midwicket runs back, the man in the deep rushes in, mid-on moves to his right. But the ball eludes all three. Mendis living dangerously"

53,"Zampa to Mendis, 1 run flatter on leg stump, firmly swept away now through backward square leg"

58,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run deflected off the thigh to short fine leg"
59,"Faulkner to Mendis, no run length ball cutter, leaves the right-hander outside off. He feebly hangs his bat out outside off and is lavishly beaten."

61,"Starc to Chandimal, no run length and outside off, Chandi throws his hands at this outside off. Looks to drive and ends up toe-ending it to mid-off"
62,"Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs too full and angled in from wide of the crease, delightfully whipped away through backward square leg. Not as stylish as Dhananjaya, though"
63,"Starc to Chandimal, no run full and bang on of stump, presses forward and creams a drive straight to mid-off"
64,"Starc to Chandimal, no run good length on off, Mendis wants a tip-and-run single. Chandi doesn't. There is a mix-up in the middle. Warner swoops down on the ball from backward point but can't splatter the stumps at the non-striker's end. Misses the chance. He could have caught Mendis short by a looooong way"
65,"Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs 141.6ks, overpitched and outside off, Chandi leans into a pretty drive. Extra cover dives to his left and takes some pace off it. Only two"

71,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run Chandi goes low and shuffles outside off to take this one on the full. Smartly swept to deep midwicket"
72,"Starc to Chandimal, no run back of a length and outside off, punchily played to cover"
73,"Starc to Chandimal, no run back of a length and angling away outside off from over the wicket, this does not bounce at all. Slides under the slashing bat"

78,"Head to Mendis, no run Head gives this loads of air, worked to leg"
79,"Head to Mendis, 1 run swept from outside off to deep midwicket"
80,"Head to Chandimal, no run tossed up slow again, Chandimal races at Head. The ball dips, creating some distance between the bat and the swinging bat. Ends up dragging an inside edge to the leg side"
81,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run slides on, hits the pad outside off. Chandi may have tickled it off an inside edge"
82,"Head to Mendis, FOUR runs pushed through on off stump, Mendis goes low hunting for a sweep. Top-edges it over the square-leg fielder"
83,"Head to Mendis, 1 run Half-century for Mendis. Fourth fifty in his eighth ODI. Continues to trouble Australia. Back of a length offbreak, dabbed with the spin to square leg. Mathews is up on his feet applauding from the change room"
84,"Hazlewood to Mendis, 1 run short and close to of stump, chopped down to third man"
85,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run Chandi charges down the track and drills it off the inside half to mid-on. He wants to break free"

96,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run a gentle little glide to point, and a great big hurry to get to the other end"
97,"Hazlewood to Mendis, 1 run a little nip-backer that has Mendis twisted around like a pretzel. He was set up for a pull shot, playing the original line of the ball, but Hazlewood moves it off the seam and cramps him. Single to midwicket"
98,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 2 runs straight lines are easy for Sri Lankan batsmen, Chandimal works it away to deep square leg"
99,"Hazlewood to Mendis, no run tails in, but it does so early enough that Mendis can spot it and nudge towards midwicket"
100,"Hazlewood to Mendis, no run shortish and just outside off, Mendis covers the line and knocks it to short midwicket"
101,"Zampa to Chandimal, FOUR runs sweeps from the stumps, but he has managed it so well! It's tossed up and drifting in, it is bound to turn, but somehow he gets on top of it and laces it with enough power to beat the man in the deep. Risky, but superbly executed"
102,"Zampa to Chandimal, 1 run short one, spots his exit at point and takes it"
103,"Zampa to Mendis, 1 run lucky again! He mistimed a slog sweep earlier, and now he just about beats point running back. Mendis was beaten in flight as he charged out, and as such the ball turns and makes him reach away from his body as he drives."
104,"Zampa to Chandimal, 1 run stays back and slaps a flatter delivery through point"
105,"Zampa to Mendis, FOUR runs slog sweep, the little man muscles it away! And there had to be plenty behind it to beat Warner at deep midwicket. It was a fairly short ball, Mendis could have pulled it, if he hadn't premeditated a sweep"
106,"Zampa to Mendis, 1 run moves across on off stump and drives to long-on"
107,"Hazlewood to Mendis, FOUR runs walllllllloppped away to long leg! For fast bowlers, this pitch is the equivalent of that little corner in class where the dunce is sent to. And Hazlewood makes it worse by bowling short. Mendis swivels on the back foot and pulls away"
108,"Hazlewood to Mendis, 1 run good length ball outside off, driven smartly to the left of mid-off"
109,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run shortish on off stump, Chandimal waits a bit as the ball holds up on the pitch and nudges it to midwicket"
110,"Hazlewood to Mendis, 1 run back of a length on off stump, tucked towards short fine leg"
111,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run cuts back in, the pace is at 133kph so it might not be an offbreak. Chandimal was whipping across the line and was beaten"
112,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run sweetly struck to point as Chandimal waited on the back foot for a late could, had he been a touch more patient he could have had a boundary at third man"
113,"Faulkner to Mendis, OUT got 'im! One mistake too many for Mendis as he pulls too early, gets a top edge and offers a dolly of a catch - for once where the fielder was. Head at midwicket takes it and Australia celebrate, giving thanks to Faulkner's offcutter slower ball holding in the pitch"
114,"Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, no run beautiful bowling from Faulkner. He has understood that this dry pitch is giving him plenty for the offcutter. And he lands it a the perfect spot - on a full length on leg stump to tempt the batsman to play across the line. Beats the outside edge"
115,"Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, no run extra bounce now! Solid puff of dust from the surface and Mathews who had been caught in the crease trying to defend suddenly has one lurching at him."
116,"Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, no run back of a length and outside off, pushed to cover"
117,"Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, OUT double-wicket over, and Head should deserves a lot of credit for this one. Takes an outstanding catch at point! Faulkner tempts the drive with a wide half-volley, Mathews takes the bait but should have gone after it harder. Head at point moves nimbly to his left, leaps up and takes it with both hands over his head"
118,"Faulkner to Dhananjaya, no run full and just outside off, defended and Faulkner finishes a double-wicket maiden."
119,"Starc to Chandimal, no run good length ball speared in from around the stumps, Chandimal deflects it towards point"
120,"Starc to Chandimal, no run shortish and fairly wide, Chandimal cuts carefully to point"
121,"Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs meets it with a serene drive all along the ground to deep cover. Gentle treatment a full toss didn't deserve"
122,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run almost, but there was no one at short midwicket to threaten this false stroke into becoming a bad stroke. Starc works the angle from around the stumps and the dry pitch holds onto the ball oh so lovingly, Chandimal flicks goes uppishly"
123,"Starc to Dhananjaya, 1 run back you vile full toss says de Silva with a lovely, wristy flick through square leg"
124,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 wide good length ball far too wide for this format. Chandimal leaves, looks at the umpire and gets what he wanted"
125,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run fuller delivery outside off, driven towards mid-off and we'll all take a drink and spoil ourselves"
126,"Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run fuller ball outside off, driven to long-off. Pressure on Chandimal to turn this into a long innings"
127,"Faulkner to Dhananjaya, no run nicely played. Faulkner is getting the ball to break sharply off the deck, so de Silva keeps his bat as close as possible, opens it towards point and plays as late as possible. Well in control of the glide"
128,"Faulkner to Dhananjaya, 1 run a little shorter, which affords him a little more time to play with, clipped away to deep midwicket"
129,"Faulkner to Chandimal, no run fuller delivery at 117 kph, defended cautiously"
130,"Faulkner to Chandimal, no run made him reach a touch with the offcutter at 118 kph, Chandimal handles it well enough with an angled face of the bat"
131,"Faulkner to Chandimal, no run falls just short of the bowler! Faulkner remains a constant threat when his line is straight. Batsman from the subcontinent invariably like swat those away through midwicket, but on this slow, dry pitch, Chandimal has to check his shot and he nearly pops one back off the leading edge"
132,"Starc to Dhananjaya, no run beaten by the slower ball from Starc! The open face of the bat flirts with the line of the ball before it even arrives - it's full and it dances on through"
133,"Starc to Dhananjaya, OUT 100 ODI wickets, and he is the fastest ever to that mark in cricket history! Big, tall, scary fast bowler makes history with a innocuous, pace-less, slow old teaser. Ah, irony. Starc had de Silva reaching outside off, thinking it was up there for a cover drive, but the ball holds in the pitch and pops over to short midwicket. Bailey moves to his right, dives and secures it. Brilliant piece of deception from Starc, and sign that he is evolving."
134,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run back of a length and outside off, slid to third man"
135,"Starc to Siriwardana, 1 run inside edge, with the new batsman in, one who hasn't faced him too much on this tour - last time, possibly in the practice match before the Tests - Siriwardana tries a dab to third man and nearly loses his stumps"
136,"Starc to Chandimal, no run oooh, delicate little late cut from Chandimal, but he placed it too fine. Wicketkeeper Wade moves swiftly to his right and stops a certain boundary"
137,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run good length ball drilled through the covers"
138,"Henriques to Chandimal, 2 runs offcutter on middle, nurdled to midwicket"
139,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run leans into a fuller ball outside off and drives into the covers"
140,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run stood up tall, or at least tried to, against the back of a length ball and squirts to through midwicket with the break on the ball"
141,"Henriques to Siriwardana, no run good bowling this, no one's bothering to put any pace on the ball. Instead they roll their fingers along the side, it makes them bite into the pitch and misbehave. The 103 kph good length ball very wide outside off sneaks under the cutting bat"
142,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run full and wide, Siriwardana attempts an unswise drive with the open face of the bat, pushing at a ball that seems very reluctant to come to him after pitching. Outside edge wanders to third man"
143,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run shortish and outside off, dabbed towards cover point. Chandimal will keep strike, which may well be good for Sri Lanka"
144,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run nudges it from off stump to deep square leg with great ease, that's how slow the pitch is"
145,"Head to Siriwardana, 1 run too short and Siriwardana nails the first shot he has today - a cut to deep point"
146,"Head to Chandimal, no run moves across in line with a slider just outside off and blocks"
147,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run good running from Siri! With his fresh legs, he knew he could make the danger end. Chandimal came forward to block, got an inside edge towards short square leg, and the keeper had to go after it himself, then turn around to throw by which time Siri was back"
148,"Head to Siriwardana, no run just wide of first slip! Beautiful bowling from Head, having plied him and Chandimal with flat darts, he decides to throw this up with a little more flight. Siri comes forward tentatively and gets an outside edge. Smith at first slip dives to his left but can't grab it"
149,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run back of a length and outside off, dabbed towards point"
150,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run offcutter, but Siri spotted it early and slices it towards the covers for a quick single. Needs to concentrate on those to make sure he gets set"
151,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run fuller ball on middle and leg, tucked behind square leg"
152,"Henriques to Siriwardana, no run full on the base of off stump, sent to cover"
153,"Henriques to Siriwardana, no run shortish and outside off, slapped to Head at point. There's a sentence I didn't think I'd say out loud"
154,"Henriques to Siriwardana, no run greets the full offcutter with an equally full face of the bat."
155,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run width offered and Chandimal spurns it with a chops straight to point"
156,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run aims a full inswinger on the base of middle and off, Chandimal does well to keep his toes out of the way and flick to short midwicket"
157,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run another yorker, tinged with reverse swing, Chandimal handled it well in the Tests and does so here too, playing late and playing with the inswing"
158,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run waits for the tail - and it is rather late so good on Hazlewood for that - but Chandimal's been in long enough to adjust his batspeed and bring it to meet the ball on the base of middle stump"
159,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run offcutter towards the end of the over, Chandimal reads it out of the hand, is helped by the ball being short too, dabs behind point"
160,"Hazlewood to Siriwardana, 1 run nicely done, he had to hit against the cut, but it wasn't prominent as Faulkner's. Siri plays late and close to his body as well to dilute the threat and gets a single to square leg"
161,"Head to Siriwardana, 1 run some turn, but slow turn, which allows Siri to adjust. He had made room to cut and ended up having too much of it. Checks his shot and keeps it to ground. Single to point"
162,"Head to Chandimal, no run appeal for a stumping from the wicketkeeper after Head runs through Chandimal! Loops it up, slows it down, gets the ball to turn and hurtle through the gate as the batsman defends. But credit to him, as far forward as he was lunging, the backfoot was down and did not move out of the crease"
163,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run fifty for Chandimal! A very responsible innings from the vice-captain. This was one of the easier runs he's gotten today, a ball on the pads, flicked away."
164,"Head to Siriwardana, 2 runs that's just gorgeous! He moves inside the line of the ball and chips a tossed up ball over cover. Magnificent timing"
165,"Head to Siriwardana, 1 run eased through the covers again, this time along the ground. Siri has understood the pace of the deck."
166,"Head to Chandimal, 1 run tossed up outside off, whipped to long-on"
167,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run back of a length on off stump, Chandimal drops an open face on it like a ton of bricks and scampers off to the other end to evade punishment"
168,"Hazlewood to Siriwardana, 2 runs just lobs over mid-on! Perhaps he wasn't expecting the short ball, or for the short ball to come at him at good pace. Must have been a lot of effort behind it from Hazlewood. The top-edge lands safely"
169,"Hazlewood to Siriwardana, no run fuller delivery outside off, driven towards cover"
170,"Hazlewood to Siriwardana, 1 run slots it into the gap in front of point and the good length ball amounts to runs"
171,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run plays around an offcutter, and enjoys an inside edge onto his pads. Would have been plumb otherwise. Not too wise a shot to be playing on a slow pitch that offers purchase for cutters"
172,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run wanders out of his crease and takes a full ball from outside off and drags it to deep midwicket"
173,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run some bounce on the offcutter, Chandimal rides it well with a tuck through to square leg, Bailey sensed a run-out chance and swooped on the ball early. Concentration drifted to throwing the ball too early and he misfields"
174,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run sweet connection on the cut shot as Siriwardana waits on the back of a length ball to come to him"
175,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run stays low, but the offcutter doesn't trouble Chandimal who pats it down the pitch"
176,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run fuller ball on off stump, whipped to deep square leg"
177,"Henriques to Siriwardana, no run defends a good length ball on leg stump, but since it was laced with offcut the ball pops out towards where silly mid-off might have been"
178,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run through the gap at cover! Siri goes aerial against the length ball, pretty much your standard ODI shot provided the pitch was true. Times it well, though and places it just about perfectly"
179,"Starc to Siriwardana, no run tinge of reverse into the left-hander, nudged towards midwicket"
180,"Starc to Siriwardana, 2 runs inside edge to a 140 kph delivery scalping for the middle of middle. Siri plays from the crease and doesn't know where the ball had gone until Chandi was rushing up at him"
181,"Starc to Siriwardana, 1 run heaves at it, but he has to settle for another pesky inside edge to long leg. Full and tailing in on off stump"
182,"Starc to Chandimal, no run ripper of a toecrusher, at 141 kph too. But Chandimal is superb too, keeps so still in the crease, brings that bat down in line with middle stump and saves himself. Cricket, you beauty!"
183,"Starc to Chandimal, no run another yorker, and this might have reverse away and beaten the outside edge. He was also beaten for pace, but the good thing was Chandimal was playing with a straight bat."
184,"Starc to Chandimal, no run lovely bowling from Starc, luckless bowling too. He pulls his length back, and has perhaps gone a little too short to get the outside edge. Reverse swing away from the bat and Chandimal was squared up, his legs on leg stump and his hands reaching out"
185,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run shortish and outside off, sliced through to point"
186,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run bounds out to meet the slower ball on off stump and yorks himself for his trouble"
187,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run runs down the track and harrumphs it down to long-on. Chandimal's decided to accelerate now."
188,"Henriques to Siriwardana, 1 run moves away to leg stump, the fast bowler follows him with a short one, pulled away to deep square leg"
189,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run struck on the ribs and he goes down! He had run down the track, Henriques reacts with an offcutter that digs into the pitch and leaps up at the batsman. Chandimal was trying to hack across the line on instinct and is struck on the ribs. He crumpled over immediately, had enough fight in him to go back into his crease but he needs serious medical attention now. I remember Pietersen wearing one like that from McGrath and going out of action for a while."
190,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run pitched up fuller now, the offcutter is Henriques' safely blanket. Sticks in the surface. Chandi waits back in the crease and flips it around to the midwicket region"
191,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run full on off stump, Chandimal plays it down to long-on"
192,"Hazlewood to Perera, no run short and wide, hammers it off the bottom of the bat to cover"
193,"Hazlewood to Perera, no run backs away to try and cut the ball off the stumps, but the cutter beats him and only just misses off stump. Thisara gets a talking to from Chandimal"
194,"Hazlewood to Perera, 1 run targets the pads and Thisara whips it in the air to the right of deep midwicket, falls just short of Smith running in"
195,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run tails in on middle - rapid reverse swing - and Chandimal was almost thrown off his feet. Manages to get his bat down in time for a single through midwicket. Hazlewood appealed thinking it was pad, but it was all wood"
196,"Hazlewood to Perera, FOUR runs cuts from the stumps and his power takes care of the result! There was point, there was short third man and he beats both of them to their left. Fierce!"
197,"Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run slower ball on off stump, Chandimal tucks it towards mid-on, Smith from midwicket hurtles in and keeps it to a single"
198,"Faulkner to Perera, no run half-volley outside off, Thisara plops his front leg aside and mauls it to extra cover."
199,"Faulkner to Perera, no run that's a beaut! Thisara set up for the big old golf swing, but the back of the hand slower ball pitches in front of where the bat could reach, landed on the seam, kicks up and sashays past the outside edge"
200,"Faulkner to Perera, OUT that is one heck of a catch from Wade running forward! But the fourth umpire has asked Thisara to wait, the third umpire will be taking a look at this. Thisara was wandering outside off stump for the scoop, Faulkner bowls it shorter and wider to complicate the shot. Desitined to be mistimed and Wade, with excellent presence of mind runs across, and boy is he quick! Had the ball in his sights all through, throws himself after the ball - he needed to, wouldn't have reached it otherwise - and catches it with his arms fully outstretched millimeters off the ground. Replays indicated the"
201,"Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run whipped towards long leg"
202,"Faulkner to Perera, no run big appeal for leg before, but this hit the new Perera too high."
203,"Starc to Chandimal, no run Starc thinks he has Chandi caught behind. Umpire Martinesz says no. Australia have used up their review. Wide of the crease, and gets it to straighten outside off. Chandi drives as the ball carries to the keeper. But, I don't think there was a nick there. Or was it? Tight call"
204,"Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs too straight in line, Chandi flicks it to midwicket with a whirl of the whirl of the wrists. Head throws it on the half-volley to the keeper. Overthrows. Two runs. Good awareness from Chandi. Hares back for the second, despite the blow on the ribs"
205,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run angles a full toss outside off, dabbed to third man"
206,"Starc to Siriwardana, OUT good length and outside off, Siriwardana's bottom hand flies off the bat as he chips a catch to mid-off, running to his right. The ball stopped at Siriwardana, who checked his loft hit and simply lobbed a catch to Finch. Stroke making is very difficult on this parched surface"
207,"Starc to Chandimal, no run Starc dishes out an off-stump full toss, sliced to point"
208,"Starc to Chandimal, 1 run wide of the crease, full and holds its line on middle, whipped down to long-on"
209,"Henriques to Chandimal, no run full and angled into the right-hander, flicked away"
210,"Henriques to Chandimal, 1 run short enough that Chandimal can rock back and cut, but it's straight to the sweeper"
211,"Henriques to Perera, 2 runs lovely connection first ball, which was slow too. Not many at that pace has been middled, but it was on the pads. Flicked to long leg"
212,"Henriques to Perera, FOUR runs 113 kph, you little beauty! Thisara's calling card is the mow over midwicket, but here he gets Sri Lanka's first boundary in over 15 overs with a delicate little leg glance that sends the roof off of Khettarama"
213,"Henriques to Perera, FOUR runs Look ma, I can hit it with my eyes closed! He was walking down the track, wandering away outside off. Henriques the enraged bowls a short ball, Thisara ducks and wafts at the ball with his bat and scoops it over short fine leg, half intending to do so, half hoping to avoid getting hit"
214,"Henriques to Perera, 1 run offcutter to finish on a good length, holds in the pitch to ruin Thisara's drive on the up"
215,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run fuller ball on off stump, nudged towards midwicket"
216,"Hazlewood to Perera, 1 bye runs down the track for a good length ball and goes for a swat down the ground. Wade misses a regulation take and gives a bye"
217,"Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run extra bounce, and Chandimal is again in a spot where he has to fear for injury! His own fault to an extent for running at the fast bowler, who shortens his length and the ball gives him a little extra. Thankfully it robs some of the pace off the ball too which means Chandimal can get his hand up and protect his face"
218,"Hazlewood to Perera, 2 runs top shot! That's at his top pace, looking for the yorker on middle. Steered to deep point"
219,"Hazlewood to Perera, FOUR runs that's helpful. Perera is beaten for pace as he tries to slice the ball behind point, but the angle and the offcut of the ball into him means the inside edge wanders to fine leg"
220,"Hazlewood to Perera, FOUR runs oof, that would hurt a fast bowler's pride. Dilruwan has slog swept him for a boundary to midwicket. Could have been a six on other grounds."
221,"Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run low full toss outside off, sliced to point"
222,"Faulkner to Perera, OUT goes for the lap sweep.... and picks out short fine leg! If he was intending to use the pace of the ball, there was very little on it. A 116 kph fuller ball on leg stump gives Faulkner his fourth"
223,"Faulkner to Aponso, 1 run low full toss outside off, drilled to mid-off"
224,"Faulkner to Chandimal, no run beaten as he slogs across the line of a good length ball outside off"
225,"Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run low full toss outside off, punched to mid-off"
226,"Faulkner to Aponso, 1 run slices it to point, Bailey has a decision to make, whether to go for a catch or hang back. He decides he wants the wicket, dives forward, but can't get there. Good on him to put his body in line with it though"
227,"6.30 pm A fairly in-between kind of total, Sri Lanka at one point looked good for 250 with their Nos. 3 and 4 hitting fifties. But neither Kusal Mendis nor Dinesh Chandimal found the going easy on a dry pitch which gave plenty for bowlers willing to slow the pace down. James Faulkner is just that kind of bowler, and he ended up with four wickets on his comeback. Have I missed anything? Hmm.. I keep having this voice in my head saying I've made a glaring err... oh yeah, Mitchell Starc coolly became the fastest bowler to take 100 ODI wickets beating a 19-year old record held by Pakistan offspinner Saqlain Mushtaq."

235,"7pm Hello again. Australia's over rate wasn't too tidy, eats up 10 minutes of the break. Mendis and Chandi found an oasis on this parched surface, put a tent up, and camped their way to fifties. Sri Lanka finished with 227, and they now have a bevy of spinners to make that score look bigger."
236,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, 3 runs soft ball - short and wide outside off - Warner latches onto it, crunching a cut in the gap at the covers"
237,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, no run good length ball from over the wicket, straightens on off, Finch wafts an outside edge towards point"
238,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, SIX runs Mathews floats it full and outside off, Finch eases forward and launches it over mid-off. Handsomely lofted for the first six of the game. At that pace - 124 - Mathews was asking to be spanked"
239,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, no run good riposte from Mathews. Finds some assistance from the surface. Length ball, explodes, a puff of dust explodes as well. Strikes Finch on the glove"
240,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, no run short of a length and outside off, leans back and cuts to point. Dilshan is lurking there"
241,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, 1 wide leg-side wide, but replays indicate that may have glanced the thigh"
242,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, 1 run back of a length on middle, does not come onto Finch, and shoots low. Finch is forced to go low with it. Jabs it to midwicket. Extra bounce first, now he has to deal with low bounce"

244,"Dilshan to Warner, no run dragged down short and outside off, Warner has loads of time to skip back and cut to backward point"
245,"Dilshan to Warner, 1 run Dilshan's reaction suggests that there was a nick there. Dilshan slows it up, throws it up outside off. Warner slashes and nicks it thickly, past the right leg of Kusal who is behind the stumps, not Chandimal. It went past the keeper quickly. Not an easy chance"
246,"Dilshan to Finch, FOUR runs Finch steps away outside leg, Dilshan stalks him. Rasping pull. Nobody there at deep square leg to cut it off"

252,"Angelo Mathews to Finch, 1 run Finch gets on top of a short ball on off. Punched to cover"
253,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run back of a length and width outside off, Warner leans back for another cut. The 39-year-old Dilshan still has it. Makes a sprawling save at backward point"

270,"Perera to Finch, no run back of a length and outside off, Finch middles a punch to extra cover"
271,"Perera to Finch, no run Thisara rolls his fingers across the cutter, drifts down the leg side, past the glance. The umpire reckons it may have kissed the thigh"
272,"Perera to Finch, FOUR runs back of a length and too straight in line again, minimalist touch from Finch. No violence here. Just tickles it fine to the leg-side boundary"
273,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run full cutter on middle, tapped to mid-off"

300,"Aponso to Smith, no run skidder from Aponso, shoots low, Smith somehow keeps it out"
301,"Aponso to Smith, no run that's a ripper from Aponso. Saw Smith race at him. The debutant held his nerve and pulled his length back shorter. Drifts in and turns away with savage extra bounce, raps the glove, and runs past Mathews at lone slip"
302,"Aponso to Smith, no run shorter and outside off, chopped to point"
303,"Siriwardana to Finch, 2 runs Finch brings up a half-century out of Australia's 66. He reaches the landmark by sweeping this length ball on middle to deep backward square leg. Good work from Mendis in the deep"

311,"Aponso to Smith, no run SL go up for a caught-behind appeal. Umpire Dar shakes his head. Big-turning break. Big bounce. Pitches on a fourth-stump line and rips away past the outside edge from a full length. Savage turner ends in Mathews' hands. How did that finish in slip's hands? Oh my...."
312,"Aponso to Smith, 1 leg bye follows the break with the skidder that pins Smith on the back foot. Rapped on the pad, but this was sliding down"

321,"Aponso to Finch, no run slides on off stump, defended back"
322,"Aponso to Finch, OUT another appeal for caught behind. Not given. Umpire Dar's review. Mathews collected it cleanly. The on-field umpires want to check whether it was a bump ball. Certainly not. TV umpire Gough looks for the nick. There was a noise. It could have come from the bat thudding the ground. No visible deflection. No conclusive evidence, yet. Tight, tight call for Gough. He looks at various replays and rules Finch out. Nice, low take from Mathews. Finch looks disgruntled. Smith chats with the umpires. Aponso has his maiden international scalp. This pitched just outside off and spun sharply at Fi"

Kusal suggested that there was a nick. But replays detect no edge. Beaten on the inside is Smith. The tracker confirms that the impact was outside off. Umpire Martinesz's call is vindicated. Umpire Gough rules it in favour of Smith. SL lose their review"

354,"Perera to Wade, 1 run flighted and spins in, Wade nicks it onto the pad"
355,"Perera to Smith, no run Mathews drops the outside edge at slip. It wasn't easy, however. Dilruwan saw Smith coming at him. Held it back outside off.

391,"Siriwardana to Bailey, no run that's vicious turn! Siri tosses it up outside leg stump, the angle is steep, but it pitches and jerks away so sharply it looked good to hit leg stump. The squared up Bailey had no idea how to react to it, brings his bat down the wrong line, gets hit on the thigh and the ball lobs to slip. Sri Lanka appeal, but that's a great decision from umpire Martinesz"

395,"Sandakan to Smith, FOUR runs good shot, the sweep has worked for the Australians, and the captain uses it well, his wrists rolling over the ball to find the gap at long leg"
396,"Sandakan to Smith, 1 run comes down the track to take the ball on the full and drives to long-on"
397,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run goes back and since the length is short he is able to read the variation - the one that goes straight - off the pitch and punch to cover"
398,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run his guard is on middle stump now, and Sandakan draws him forward to defend with the flight. But then the ball dips and turns wildly past the inside edge."
399,"Sandakan to Bailey, 1 wide pitches on middle and then turns further down leg, Bailey attempts a flick but he may as well have left the ball considering how far the ball turned. Great work from keeper Perera"
400,"Sandakan to Bailey, 1 run uppish, but he gets off the mark! It's a slightly shortish delivery, Bailey went back to flick it away, thinking he had it easy. But the ball holds in the pitch and reaches the batsman who had almost completed his stroke. Short midwicket was there, but the ball goes to his left"
401,"Sandakan to Smith, 1 run lunges as far forward as he could to reach the ball and brutishly sweep it away to long leg"
402,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run flighted on middle and leg, Smith defends with bat in front of pad. Soft hands, Smithy"
403,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run reaches the pitch and tries to force the ball past the bowler, but Siri, along with two over fielders deny him a single. Dilshan, all of 39 years old, looks lightning on the field at short cover"
404,"Siriwardana to Smith, 1 run drives down to long-off as Dilshan mimes putting the ball where the sweep results in a top edge"
405,"Siriwardana to Bailey, FOUR runs misfield on the point boundary and the panic stricken Bailey gets away with a reverse sweep. Terrible work by de Silva, diving past the ball"
406,"Siriwardana to Bailey, FOUR runs that's much better. That's how you impose yourself. Pick the length early - its short - jump back in the crease and throw your weight behind the shot. Creamed through cover"
407,"Siriwardana to Bailey, 1 run a little too full so Bailey doesn't have to worry about turn, he just drives through the line of the ball to long-off"
408,"Sandakan to Bailey, 3 runs premeditates a reverse sweep and is helped out by the ball being quite slow, and so tossed up that he can reach it almost on the full. Three to third man, excellent running from Smith, he senses Bailey is being troubled, he wants to take more of the strike"
409,"Sandakan to Smith, 1 run lovely batting, waited for the ball to come at him, doesn't take any decision to play until he has to and dabs the ball past short leg"
410,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run backs away, and the turn on the ball takes the ball too far from him. Bottom edges the cut to point"
411,"Sandakan to Bailey, 1 run gets the sweep out, appears to be a good option in Khettarama"
412,"Sandakan to Smith, no run tossed up just outside off, Smith lunges forward but can't quite get to the pitch. Inside edge onto pad, short leg lurking"
413,"Sandakan to Smith, FOUR runs mid-off was up, Smith ran down the pitch and belts it over his head! Excellent batting from the captain, it seems to me he is trying to push Australia as close to the target as quick as possible. He knows this pitch, and this bowling, eats new batsman up for breakfast and burps them to smithereens"
414,"Siriwardana to Bailey, 1 run tossed up on and around off stump, Bailey batting on leg stump has the room the drive through extra"
415,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run a little turn, just enough to take Smith's outside edge. But the clever bit about that ball was making Smith reach out to drive"
416,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run a flatter ball outside off, Smith goes back to cut and misses"
417,"Siriwardana to Smith, 1 run leans into the drive and hits it with the turn, along the ground to deep cover. Purpose from Smith."
418,"Siriwardana to Bailey, no run not entirely short for the cut, and the misjudgment of length doesn't cause Bailey too much harm. Lobs over his outside edge, and the stumps as well"
419,"Siriwardana to Bailey, no run that's almost too good, the ball is tossed up and angled in on off stump, Bailey plays a drive on the up and the ball cha-chas past the outside edge"
420,"Aponso to Smith, no run good length ball going on with the arm, Smith blocks it down the pitch"
421,"Aponso to Smith, no run stays back to block having read the ball off the pitch. Aponso's ability to slide the ball through on this pitch should be useful He almost bowls with the seam perpendicular to the pitch, so the ball always hits the leather and goes on"
422,"Aponso to Smith, no run tossed up on middle, defended with a straight bat on middle"
423,"Aponso to Smith, no run leans forward and defends"
424,"Aponso to Smith, no run moves to his left and saves a single as Smith drives down the ground"
425,"Aponso to Smith, no run that's a ripper! Slows it down so beautifully, does so by giving the ball a massive amount of loop. Even Smith is sucked into pushing at it. And is soundly beaten by turn and bounce"
426,"Siriwardana to Bailey, no run pushed through on middle and leg, defended towards short cover"
427,"Siriwardana to Bailey, FOUR runs batting outside leg, which comes in handy when the bowler pitches short. Almighty pull through straight midwicket. Bailey's been iffy, but he has got the bad ball away"
428,"Siriwardana to Bailey, 1 run another short one, Bailey pats it through to the sweeper"
429,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run tossed up on middle and off, defended"
430,"Siriwardana to Smith, FOUR runs delicious, says Smith as he picks the bones off a juicy old long hop! Leaps back and whip-pulls over midwicket"
431,"Siriwardana to Smith, no run how do you play that?! Smith, having attempted to go back and defend a turning, bouncing, spitting-poison, twisting-the-world-on-its-head delivery, is beaten and walks down the pitch with a helpless smile"
432,"Aponso to Bailey, no run good length on off stump, defended"
433,"Aponso to Bailey, 1 run stays back and has all the time he needs to handle the flatter delivery outside off. On a slow pitch, that's the length the batsman wants the spinner to bowl. Pushed through point"
434,"Aponso to Smith, no run goes back on middle, pushed down the pitch"
435,"Aponso to Smith, no run rambunctious appeal for a catch at silly point. Smith had charged out, Aponso had pulled his length back and the slider hits the front pad, grazes the back pad, doesn't go anywhere near the bat and goes to the man under the lid"
436,"Aponso to Smith, no run tossed up on middle, defended"
437,"Aponso to Smith, no run looped up on off stump, Smith defends inside the line expecting no turn, but there is some. Gets an outside edge past slip. Smith gestures for a change of gloves."
438,"Perera to Bailey, no run good length ball outside off, driven into the covers"
439,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run back of a length and outside off, steered past Dilshan at point. For once he comes up short. Sign of Sri Lanka slouching a bit?"
440,"Perera to Smith, no run comes in line with a short of a good length ball and meets it with a firm and straight bat"
441,"Perera to Smith, 3 runs that's gorgeous from Smith! The ball is coming down on a straight line - Thisara should really bowl those cutters - so the batsman moves across and whips it away off his thighs past short fine leg. With that man up inside the circle, he had plenty of runs for the taking"
442,"Perera to Bailey, no run good length ball outside off, defended to point"
443,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run fuller ball outside off, driven to mid-off"
444,"Aponso to Bailey, no run tossed up on leg stump, pushed back"
445,"Aponso to Bailey, no run bunts a shortish delivery on middle back down the pitch, Aponso fielders it with a dive to his right"
446,"Aponso to Bailey, no run moves inside the line and drives to short cover"
447,"Aponso to Bailey, 1 run the bowler tried to stop it, first by bowling at the pads of Bailey who is batting on leg stump to open up the off side, and then moving to his left. But the drive beats him"
448,"Aponso to Smith, 1 wide pushed through down leg"
449,"Aponso to Smith, 1 run takes the ball from outside off and the whiplash of his wrists are powerful enough to send it to deep square leg. Can't bowl that short on this pitch"
450,"Aponso to Bailey, no run flighted on middle and off, defended"
451,"Perera to Smith, no run goes back and slices the ball towards point"
452,"Perera to Smith, 1 run fuller ball outside off, driven to mid-off and that single brings up Smith's fifty. An innings of great importance for his team. It's been his presence that has stopped Sri Lanka from getting on the roll they've showed they could do in the Tests"
453,"Perera to Bailey, no run back of a length and outside off, defended"
454,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run shortish delivery on off stump, Bailey chops it to third man"
455,"Perera to Smith, 2 runs worked away into the leg side, they want two and they get it. Smith is a master at dragging balls from outside off to the leg side, whether they kick, scream or just plain scowl at him"
456,"Perera to Smith, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
457,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, no run slaps a full and wide one at cover"
458,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, no run gets up off his toes to slice a shortish delivery towards point"
459,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, 1 run jumps back to flick a shortish delivery through midwicket."
460,"Angelo Mathews to Smith, 1 run shortish and outside off, cut to deep third man"
461,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, 1 run fuller ball driven sweetly to the sweeper cover"
462,"Angelo Mathews to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, punched towards cover"
463,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run starts off with a short delivery on off stump, drilled to long-on"
464,"Perera to Smith, FOUR runs oooh, the square leg umpire was in the line of fire. Does half a split to evade the ball, which then skips along on its merry way to the square leg boundary. Clumsy Sandakan stares after it, heartbroken"
465,"Perera to Smith, 1 run"
466,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run goes for the reverse sweep, taking the ball from leg stump"
467,"Perera to Henriques, 2 runs shuffles back and with the ball on leg stump, he gets the easy option to flick it away and get two runs so he won't be on strike in the next over"
468,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, no run back of a length and outside off, tapped to point"
469,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, 1 run back of a length and outside off, cut to deep third man"
470,"Angelo Mathews to Henriques, no run mistakes the offcutter as a run-scoring opportunity and the cover drive nearly lobs back to Mathews"
471,"Angelo Mathews to Henriques, 1 run shortish and outside off, slices to deep third man"
472,"Angelo Mathews to Bailey, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, flicked away behind square"
473,"Angelo Mathews to Henriques, 1 run walks across towards a good length ball on off stump and gets an inside edge as he tries to defend. Even the fast bowlers, if they're willing to roll their fingers over the ball, are causing problems to the new batsman. These 32 runs may be the toughest Australia score on this tour, especially considering how badly they want them"
474,"Perera to Henriques, 1 run top edge, but fine leg is on the boundary. Premeditates a sweep and ends up mistiming a short ball"
475,"Perera to Bailey, 1 wide poor line form Dilruwan, pitching on middle stump when the ball is spinning big. Great take from Kusal again"
476,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run lovely sweep - first the big front stride, then the bat coming down on top of the ball and the wrists rolling over the ball to send it to deep square leg"
477,"Perera to Henriques, 1 run tucked away towards deep square leg off the back foot"
478,"Perera to Bailey, no run moves around the stumps now for a flatter ball on off stump, defended"
479,"Perera to Bailey, 2 runs great effort from Dilruwan, diving to his right, full-length, but the drive to long-on evades him and Bailey and Henriques have stolen two"
480,"Perera to Bailey, no run flighted outside off - a much better length. It has Bailey prodding forward and the defensive shot results in an inside edge, not enough deliveries in that area"
481,"Sandakan to Head, 1 run has he picked the googly? It seemed like it, since he went back and committed to the flick when the line of the ball - had it been an orthodox delivery - demanded a cover drive"
482,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run big turn! Sandakan lobs it up a set of stumps outside off, and since it is on a length, Bailey is fooled into going back to cut. Gets the biggest shock of his life when it hurtles back into him"
483,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run tossed up outside off, driven through the covers"
484,"Sandakan to Bailey, 2 runs that's a googly, George! You don't need any room when it's pitched outside off and destined to spin away. Just about reaches it with the bottom of his bat and the cut shot gets him a couple"
485,"Sandakan to Bailey, no run massive turn again as a good length ball pitches outside off and turns right across the right-hander and into the keeper's gloves down the leg side. Bailey wants to know why that wasn't a wide, umpire Dar says it pitched outside off"
486,"Perera to Head, 1 run stays back and slaps a flatter delivery through to deep point"
487,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run almost another super snap Gunathilaka at short leg! Bailey went back to flick, and nailed the shot. That's the only thing that saved him as the ball hits the fielder's shoulder and goes away"
488,"Perera to Head, no run defends a good length ball down the pitch"
489,"Perera to Head, no run goes back, looking to play off the pitch, and defends. Risky that when the length is so full on off stump"
490,"Perera to Head, 1 run flighted on leg stump, driven to long-off"
491,"Perera to Bailey, no run goes back to a length ball and blocks it with hard hands"
492,"Sandakan to Head, no run goes for a big drive, but the ball dips on him and the outside edge wanders to backward point"
493,"Sandakan to Head, 1 run a little short and outside off, cuts it away to the man in the deep"
494,"Sandakan to Bailey, 1 run"
495,"Sandakan to Head, FOUR runs that's short, the wrist spinner, especially a young one, might have to stomach through a few of those. But Sandakan would have preferred one of those hadn't popped out at this time. Head was quite happy though, jumping back and pulling it away through midwicket"
496,"Sandakan to Head, no run wide and full, Head was looking to drive through cover and gets an inside edge"
497,"Sandakan to Head, no run picks the googly, waits on the back foot and pulls to mid-on"
498,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run indulges in a reverse sweep, when the line of the ball was a little too close to middle stump. Had he missed it, he might just have been lbw"
499,"Perera to Head, 1 run hangs back, and when the really full ball pitches and turns sharply, he is caught in no-man's land. Hurries into a defensive push, with an open face, and gets an outside edge"
500,"Perera to Faulkner, no run tossed up on off, Faulkner nudges it to short midwicket"
501,"Perera to Faulkner, no run tentative forward defence from Faulkner as Perera loops the ball up outside off"
502,"Perera to Faulkner, 1 run oooh, that's tight. Faulkner goes back, his feet betraying his nerves, and does well to gently pat the ball behind square leg and away from the fielder under the helmet. Sri Lanka needed a few more close-in fielders in that over"
503,"Dilshan to Faulkner, no run he's worth his weight in tons of runs, Gunathilaka! Gets struck on the bare forearm with Faulkner playing a full-blooded pull"
504,"Dilshan to Faulkner, 2 runs goes for a sweep despite the length behind short, and he was into the shot so early that the ball lobbed off the back of the bat and away over the wicketkeeper"
505,"Dilshan to Faulkner, 1 wide tossed up, a little quick on leg stump, Faulkner goes for the sweep and it just misses leg stump. Wide called with the batsman having swept from outside off"
506,"Dilshan to Faulkner, 1 run shortish, which makes matters easy for a nervous batsman, can play from the crease, wait for the offbreak and play with it to deep square leg"
507,"Dilshan to Head, no run shortish on off stump, defended"
508,"Dilshan to Head, no run short and wide, slapped to short cover"
509,"Dilshan to Head, 1 run comes on with the arm, but Head plays it well enough, backing away and cutting from the stumps"
510,"Perera to Head, no run attempts a cut off a good length ball pitching on off stump and leaping away to the keeper's gloves"
511,"Perera to Head, no run huge chance for a run-out but Dilruwan doesn't pick up the ball! Head was trying to flick, gets struck on the pad and wants to hide in the other end. Had come halfway down, with the non-striker did not move at all, he didn't want anything to do with it"
512,"Perera to Starc, 1 run a little too full and Starc drives fluently to long-off"
513,"Perera to Faulkner, 1 run quick, full, right on middle and off, Faulkner comes forward tentatively and gets an inside edge past short leg. Streaky, but effective"
514,"Perera to Starc, 1 run nicely tossed up on off stump, Starc drives it to long-off again, short cover didn't put in the dive"
515,"Dilshan to Starc, 2 runs outside edge, squirts away to the sweeper cover and scores are level"

517,"Dilshan to Starc, no run goes back to a flatter ball and pushes to short cover"
518,"Dilshan to Starc, no run driven to short cover again as a quicker, fuller one comes at him on leg stump"
519,"Dilshan to Starc, 1 run Australia win. It's short and a shade outside off, punched through the covers - punches the air as he runs as well - and signs the match off. Winnings runs, and becoming the fastest to 100 ODI wickets in the same game. Starc, you beauty."
520,"10.13 pm The touring Australian fans are happy, they've even got the traditional Faulkner-out-there-at-the-end-for-the-win template. But the bulk of the work was done by the opener Aaron Finch, who wasn't here for the Tests, blazing away at the start, knowing getting runs off the quicks and against the new ball would be vital on a pitch where hitting through the line was rife with danger. Smith had to combat that in the middle order, and he buckled down to play one of his best innings so far. It may only have been 58 runs, but after that abysmal Test series, and plenty of spinners and enough rippers beating the"
521,"10.30 pm That's a wrap, hope you enjoyed having a little bit of cricket come at you when rain has ravaged the game for the last couple of days. The next ODI of the series is on Wednesday, hope to see you then too."
