249,"Neesham to Starc, OUT polite appeal for caught behind from Watling. Given out by umpire Martell. Did the brush the glove on its way? Or just the helmet? Starc challenges the on-field decision.

252,"6.05pm From 92 for 4 in 20.1 overs, Australia finish at 324 for 8. New Zealand's bowling, especially at the slog overs was poor and their fielding was probably worse.
