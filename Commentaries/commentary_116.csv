0,"10.10am There's a hint of light rain lurking around the ground this morning, but hopefully it'll all blow over by the start of play. Still 20 minutes to go until the toss."
1,"10.25am The suggestion from the front line is that D'Arcy Short could be set to make his ODI debut today. Potentially a switch at the top with Travis Head, but all will be revealed shortly."
2,"10.30am It looks as though the toss is going to be pushed back to 10.40am, but the groundstaff are still hopeful of a prompt 11am start. We shall see"
3,"Australia 1 Travis Head 2 D'Arcy Short, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Marcus Stoinis, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 Aaron Finch, 7 Tim Paine (capt & wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Andrew Tye, 10 Kane Richardson, 11 Jhye Richardson"
4,"England: 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Jason Roy, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Sam Billings, 6 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 David Willey, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood"
5,Sam Billings is confirmed as Morgan's replacement.
6,"""It's a bit overcast and it might swing,"" reasons Tim Paine, not unreasonably."
7,"Heads is the correct call, and Australia will bowl. Short is in for Neser, and as flagged, Stanlake is out, Jhye Richardson comes in. He's got wheels."
8,10.40am Here comes the toss. But Eoin Morgan has had a back spasm. He is out of the game Jos Buttler will captain in his absence
9,"10.47am Well, that was more dramatic than expected. Morgan's 69 was crucial to England's victory at The Oval. Two wicketkeeper-captains today, which is unusual."
10,"10.58am Right, let's play some cricket. Out come the England openers, and you suspect that Jason Roy in particular will be grateful not to have Stanlake bearing down on him. Jhye Richardson is rapid though... this will be fun."

20,"Kane Richardson to Roy, no run on the back foot again, a half-cock drive back to the bowler"
21,"Kane Richardson to Roy, FOUR runs slammed to the fence! You can't bowl there to any international batsman, or most club batsmen, to be fair. Short, wide, and in the slot for the cut"
22,"Kane Richardson to Roy, no run leaning onto the front foot, and pushed back down the pitch"
23,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, FOUR runs another beautifully timed strike from Bairstow, utilising the width and extra pace, placing bat on ball, and easing it through backward point"

25,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, 1 run worked into the covers once more"

37,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, FOUR runs that is butchered through the covers! Less movement this time, and Bairstow finds a full face, wonderful balance, on the front foot and whistling to the rope"
38,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run a bottom-handed punch but straight to short cover this time"
39,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run banged in short, but that's not too high for the umpire's liking. Well directed"

43,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, no run angling into the stumps, eased out to point off the front foot"

45,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, FOUR runs flogged up and over extra cover this time! Not timed on this occasion, but Bairstow picks his spot well, finding space behind the inner ring. Expensive over..."
46,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, FOUR runs another boundary, this time off the toes! Richardson over-compensates, slides into the pads, and is clipped imperiously in front of square"
47,"Agar to Roy, no run good areas to start, tweaking into the pads"
48,"Agar to Roy, 2 runs pushed confidently into the covers, Bairstow's rapid running ensures an easy couple"
49,"Agar to Roy, FOUR runs thwacked with intent, up and overs the covers! One, two, three bounces and into the rope. Selective and dismissive"
50,"Agar to Roy, 1 run fuller face on a more probing length, pressed back down the pitch"
51,"Agar to Bairstow, FOUR runs squashed through point, and up comes England's fifty in dismissive fashion. Too much width and tonked to the rope!"

59,"Kane Richardson to Roy, 1 run opens the face for a dab through third man"
60,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, OUT tighter line, Bairstow has a swish, and nicks through to the keeper! Bairstow was a victim of over-confidence there, looking to leather everything in his slot, but picking the wrong shot for that ball. The switch of ends works, and Australia have a toe-hold!"

299,"Tye to Plunkett, OUT whoops, a mistimed wipe to the leg side, a non-existent single, but Plunkett figures it's better to get Buttler back on strike. He's not even in the frame as the bails are whipped off. Fair play!"

But credit to Australia for hauling the runaway train back in the latter overs. It's a quick turnaround after the rain."
304,"Howdy, folks. Here come the Australia openers in Cardiff... Meanwhile, it's still kicking off in St Lucia; or rather, it isn't, with Sri Lanka so far refusing to play after the umpires changed the ball and hit them with a five-run penalty"
305,"David Willey to start off from the Cathedral End, two slips in"

326,"Wood to Head, OUT flicked into the leg side, uppish but dying in front of midwicket... where Hales scoops up a brilliant one-handed catch! That is a superb effort, throwing himself forward and low to his right! They are going to check with the TV umpire, but the soft signal is out. Yep, Dharmasena is happ"
