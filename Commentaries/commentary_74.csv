223,"Udana to Maxwell, OUT Brilliant run out from Udana! Ridiculously good in fact! The back of the hand slower ball was brilliant in itself, forced Maxwell to check his shot, pushing to long on, Udana dived across full stretch, stopped it one handed. Both batsmen retreated. Udana rolled over and threw the non striker's stumps down with Carey just short as he dove back! Magnificent work"
224,"Udana to Maxwell, 3 runs sliced just over Mathews at backward point! Another great slower ball forces a mistake from Maxwell, he was through the shot too soon but he just spooned it over backward point!"
225,"Udana to Cummins, OUT another direct hit from Udana! This is superb! He nails the yorker, Cummins digs it out on the on side and takes off, Udana whips across like a leopard, Cummins is sent back by Maxwell, Udana gathers, steadies, fires and hits with Cummins miles out at the striker's end!"
226,"Udana to Starc, 1 run wide half volley, he drives firmly to long off"
227,"Udana to Maxwell, 2 runs full on leg, he clips this through midwicket and they sprint back for two"
228,"Udana to Maxwell, 1 run nearly another direct hit from Udana! Slower ball, Maxwell gets a leading edge back to the bowler, he misfields, they pinch a run as Udana cleans up and the throw is wide"

230,"Perera to Starc, 1 run 126kph, full on leg, he whips this off his toes through midwicket the sweeper in the deep"

233,"Perera to Starc, 1 run 125kph, low full toss, he drives this firmly to long on"
234,"Perera to Maxwell, FOUR runs he whips this from outside off stump through square leg! Not quite a six but a seriously good shot! That was an excellent wide yorker, he stepped outside off and whipped it with the bottom hand just past square leg and the man at deep midwicket can't cut it off!"
235,Shashank will be back soon to take you through the start of the chase.
236,"As we wait for the chase, a good time to fill your ears with the latest edition of our Talking World Cup podcast, where our crew make a good fist of making sense of the rivalry, as complex as it is (also on Apple Podcasts here)"
237,Udana was sensational.
238,2.09pm Innings Break Australia gets 7 for 334 on the back of a stunning 153 from the skipper Aaron Finch. Steve Smith played beautifully and Glenn Maxwell delivered a gem at the end.
239,"Starc to Dimuth, 1 run edged and it races down to square third man where Kane Richardson mops it up"
240,"Starc to Perera, no run length ball veering in from wide of the crease, Kusal is hit high on the pad as he plays outside the line. Beat him on the inside edge. Good bowling"
241,"Starc to Perera, FOUR runs uppish but into the gap! Scorching drive between cover and point."
242,"Starc to Perera, 1 leg bye rip roaring yorker, Kusal is thrown off balance as he squeezes this between his legs and past the keeper. Came off the pad. Finch and Australia don't review. Good call."
243,"Starc to Dimuth, 2 runs steered over the diving Maxwell at point, down to square third man. Richardson had to move to his left this time, comfortably back for the second run"
244,"Starc to Dimuth, FOUR runs stands tall and spanks this wide of point. Got on top of the bounce, used the width and let his timing do the rest. Superb from the skipper. Sri Lanka couldn't have asked for a better start. Gets their fans going, the flags are out"
245,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run helped along to fine leg. Did he get some bat on it? Yes, a very faint one onto the thigh pad. He was hurried for pace first up."
246,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run slants a short of length delivery across, left alone"
247,"Cummins to Dimuth, 3 runs full on the pads and Dimuth nearly flicks this into the gap past the diving square leg fielder. The ball slows up near the boundary. Excellent wrist work"
248,"Cummins to Perera, FOUR runs he's blasted this pull in front of square, tracer bullet stuff! Picked the length early and flat-batted this disdainfully. This is an excellent start for Sri Lanka, stand-and-deliver stuff"
249,"Cummins to Perera, no run much fuller and straighter, squirts this into the off side"
250,"Cummins to Perera, FOUR runs pulled! This is even better. Right off the middle. Into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Short square boundary that side and at the moment, there's just one winner in this battle. Magnificent approach to the chase. Can Sri Lanka sustain this?"
251,"Starc to Dimuth, no run driven back but Starc stops it with his boot on his followthrough. Was timed beautifully though"
252,"Starc to Dimuth, no run hops back into the crease and defends back this length delivery. Speedgun clocks that at 149kph"
253,"Starc to Dimuth, 2 runs squared up, gets a thick edge and Richardson comes around at third man to stop"
254,"Starc to Dimuth, no run on the floor! Yorker honing into the leg at 150kph, Dimuth falls over as he tries to negotiate that."
255,"Starc to Dimuth, no run ducks under this ripper of a bouncer angling in from wide of the crease"
256,"Starc to Dimuth, no run beaten for pace, looks to tuck it square but this brushes his thigh pad on the way through to the keeper."
257,"Cummins to Perera, no run punches this length delivery straight to point"
258,"Cummins to Perera, no run hits him low on the bat as he tries to drive, rolls to mid-off. The ball is thudding into the bat than it being the other way. Cummins working up serious pace."
259,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge past midwicket"
260,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run mistimes this straight drive back to the bowler. Once again late on the shot, toe-ended it."
261,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run beaten as he looks to slash this with a closed bat face. Lucky to not get an edge."
262,"Cummins to Dimuth, 3 runs gorgeous! How good does he look when he looks to play proper cricketing shots? Not a half-volley by any means but he plans half-forward and laces this into the gap between cover and point. Ball slows down towards the square boundary"
263,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten as he gets this to nip away off the seam from the fourth-stump."
264,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run punches this length ball to mid-on"
265,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten for pace as this skids back in to hit him high on the pad. Stifled appeal, not out."
266,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run defends this full delivery back to the bowler"
267,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten as he pokes at this delivery with an angled bat face. The change of angle seems to be working already for Australia."

269,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run away-going length ball which he bunts to the off side"
270,"Cummins to Dimuth, FOUR runs no timing but gets enough on this pull as it races down the hill to the midwicket boundary. This was short, angling away and Dimuth picked the length early and went through with the pull. Lovely."
271,"Cummins to Dimuth, FOUR runs off a thick inside-edge, Cummins can't believe how that's not cannoned into the stumps! Feeble push at a delivery angling away, no feet. Lucky to survive."
272,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as he looks to turn this to the leg side."
273,"Cummins to Dimuth, no run takes a step across and drives this into the off side"

277,"Behrendorff to Perera, 1 run mistimes this pull into the gap at midwicket"

279,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, FOUR runs not for the first time tonight have we seen a thick inside edge flying past the stumps. Dollops of luck here for the skipper as he is late on the frontfoot drive, races to the fine leg boundary."
280,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run hops back and tucks this into the gap at square leg"
281,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run Richardson bowled, Dimuth defends, but one of them attempted this delivery in half-heated fashion. Replays confirm Dimuth wasn't entirely read. Dead ball. So he'll rebowl that? Okay, umpire says it's a legal ball as the batsman ended up facing it"
282,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, FOUR runs on the pads and he's clipped this wide of short fine leg. Easy, very easy. Nothing more than a warm-up delivery. Help-me-on-its-way welcome drink"
283,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, 1 run beaten as he looks to slap this away"
284,"Kane Richardson to Perera, no run right behind the line as he blocks"
285,"Kane Richardson to Perera, 2 runs hammered, absolutely hammered. Some effort that from Pat Cummins to run around from deep square to where a deep midwicket would be. Saved two runs for the side"
286,"Kane Richardson to Perera, 1 run hoicked across the line to deep square leg"
287,"Behrendorff to Perera, SIX runs shades of Jayasuriya! Width and he clobbers this length ball over the extra cover boundary. Stand and deliver"
288,"Behrendorff to Perera, 2 runs clipped into the gap and they take two more"
289,"Behrendorff to Perera, 5 runs they chance a single of the type Sehwag did after tucking one to mid-on and taking on Lehmann's throw in that 2003 final. This time, there's an overthrow from Finch and they get five (four overthrows). It's all going Sri Lanka's way so far. Kusal threw himself in desperation to complete the run, but not sure even that dive would've saved him if it was a dire"
290,"Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run superbly flicked down to deep square leg"
291,"Behrendorff to Perera, no run right behind the line of this incoming length ball as he defends"
292,"Behrendorff to Perera, FOUR runs slipping down leg and he tickles this past short fine leg. Pacy, angling in and all he had to do was get some bat along the way."
293,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, 1 run on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side"
294,"Kane Richardson to Perera, 2 runs pulled across the line, not timed all that well but he'll come back for the second"
295,"Kane Richardson to Perera, FOUR runs dismissed from his presence! Banged in short, Perera wallops this pull in front of square. Raced away to the fence. Tired delivery from Richardson, not going to help bowling such lengths in the mid-130s. Cracking stroke that has forced a new bat on its way. The Sri Lankan fans in the stands are loving it, absolutely loving it."
296,"Kane Richardson to Perera, no run beaten, extra bounce that time. Looked to run it down. Richardson and Carey think there may be something here, right on the edge and Finch reviews with two seconds on the clock. Let's see if there is a spike there. Replays come back with a straight line, which means there is no spike and Kusal can continue batting. Not out and Australia lose a review."
297,"Kane Richardson to Perera, 1 run slapped to the man at sweeper cover, Khawaja it is"
298,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run gets half-forward and bunts this into the off side"

309,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run gets besides the line as he punches this short of length delivery to cover"
310,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, FOUR runs he's clubbed this pull over midwicket, Khawaja may have got an inch on that one but it's not enough. Dimuth has a half-century and his mates are on their feet, as are the fans. What a superb knock so far."
311,"Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run hops back and defends this short of length delivery."
312,"Maxwell to Perera, 1 run width and he slaps this to deep point"
313,"Maxwell to Dimuth, no run massive appeal for lbw, not given but Australia can't review. Deceived in flight as he looks to skip out, plays all around it and is beaten by the drift. Looked out to me.. Poor decision from Illingworth."

315,"Maxwell to Dimuth, 1 run works this with the angle to deep midwicket, the 100's up for Sri Lanka."

326,"Maxwell to Dimuth, no run turns this to short fine, saw him coming and cleverly shortened his length"
327,"Maxwell to Dimuth, 3 runs whips this into the huge gap between mid-on and deep midwicket. Excellent fielding, excellent running. Shaun Marsh covered good ground and then was off balance and going over the ropes -airborne - as he flicked it back"

333,"Starc to Dimuth, no run controls this gentle nudge to the leg side, kept it down."
334,"Starc to Dimuth, FOUR runs helped along, no slip and it races to the third man boundary. All he had to do was hit it wide of the keeper, which he did."

351,"Maxwell to Thirimanne, 1 run drifting into leg stump, he clips this with the drift through midwicket"
