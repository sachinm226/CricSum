124,"As for standout players, Naim's 36-ball 28 doesn't look too bad given Bangladesh finished with only one wicket in hand. Afif's 17-ball 20 deserves a shout out too. Hazlewood excellent to get Soumya and Shakib out, and Swepson really got the ball to zip around."
125,"7.35pm Lots of cutters, plenty of turn, and Bangladesh are restricted to 104 for 9. The Australians are smiling, the Bangladesh dugout looks disappointed with the effort, but you never know, maybe it was still a good choice to bat first on this deck.
