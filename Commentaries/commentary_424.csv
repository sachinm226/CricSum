15,"Anderson to Haddin, no run good ball from Anderson, probing just outside off and swinging away a fraction, Haddin defends"
16,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs that's a cracking, punchy off-drive from Haddin. Really terrific timing as he just leans in to that shot and pushes it back past the bowler, Pietersen at mid-off dives across and can't save it, though he perhaps should have"

33,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs Watson hasn't had much of the strike the past couple of overs and he doesn't waste this delivery! Anderson dropped just a touch short and Watson lashed a pull forward of midwicket, super timing and that was always a boundary"

43,"Finn to Watson, 1 run this one is driven harder along the ground past the bowler but it's only a single as Pietersen at mid-off does well to dive across and save this"

50,"Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs and another boundary, though this one was a more genuine edge. But he went hard, and it flew over the vacant second slip area - he'd have to have been Joel Garner to have any hope, even if there was a man there - and it bounces away to th"

54,"Finn to Watson, no run there's an lbw shout as Finn angles it in to Watson, but Rod Tucker isn't interested. It looked to be sliding down leg but Strauss wants a review. Hmm, it's hit him in line but he's quite a way forward, and the replays confirm that is missing l"
55,"Finn to Watson, 1 run Finn tries for the yorker again but it's just a touch half-volleyish and Watson drives a single wide of mid-off"
56,"Finn to Haddin, no run this one's a very good yorker - Haddin can do nowt but keep it out"

72,"Woakes to Haddin, no run Haddin drops this one at his feet and thinks about a quick single, but Marsh sends him back"
73,"Woakes to Haddin, no run oh, Haddin is lucky to get away with this one as Woakes angles it back in and draws an inside edge that clips the back leg and sails just over the top of the stumps"

92,"Finn to Haddin, no run pushed away to the off side"
93,"Finn to Haddin, OUT well, Brad Haddin's walking around in the crease has cost him now, and he's been bowled through his legs! Finn gets his first ODI wicket as Haddin tries to move across to the off side and clip through leg, but he's missed it completely and the ba"

238,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run Smith is off the mark straight away, with a defensive push to cover that he turns into a quick single"
239,"Woakes to Clarke, no run pushed away to the off side"
240,"Woakes to Clarke, no run left alone outside off, good line from Woakes"
241,"Woakes to Clarke, no run fullish and angling in, Clarke gets forward and nudges to off"
242,"Woakes to Clarke, 1 run Clarke drives through cover now and gets a single that takes him to 49 and allows him to retain the strike"
243,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run short and wide of off to start with and that brings Clarke his half-century, as he cuts a single forward of point"
244,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run Smith pushes a single wide of cover, in much the same way as he got off the mark"
245,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke cuts but can only get a single to deep point"
246,"Anderson to Smith, 1 wide bad ball, way down leg side and that's a bonus run for the Aussies"
247,"Anderson to Smith, no run on the pads and Smith tries to clip through midwicket, can't find the gap"
248,"Anderson to Smith, no run angling in to off stump, Smith just pushes to mid-off"
249,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run Smith opens the face now and runs a single down to third man"
250,"Shahzad to Smith, 1 run Smith drives through cover but can only get a single"
251,"Shahzad to Johnson, 1 run goes for the yorker and Johnson drives a single towards mid-off"
252,"Shahzad to Smith, 1 bye a good slower ball from Shahzad and Smith wound up for a big slog over cover, but the change of pace was too good for the batsman to connect, although they do snaffle a bye"
253,"Shahzad to Johnson, FOUR runs bouncer, Johnson goes for the pull and gets a top edge that sails just a few inches over the leaping Prior and runs away for a boundary"
254,"Shahzad to Johnson, FOUR runs and Johnson launches a powerful drive back past the bowler and gets another valuable boundary"
255,"Shahzad to Johnson, 1 wide oh dear, Shahzad is absolutely hobbling in here, and it's a horrible result for England as he sprays a wide and therefore has to bowl again"
256,"Shahzad to Johnson, 3 runs Johnson backs away and gets a big inside edge that runs away to fine leg for three runs"
257,"Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson backs away again and just gets a bit of bat through to Prior along the ground, Prior's underarm hits the stumps but Johnson wasn't trying for a run"
258,"Anderson to Johnson, OUT Anderson strikes! Good bowling as he aims at the stumps - leg stump to be specific - and Johnson goes for the big hoick through the leg side and he's bowled"
259,"Anderson to Hastings, no run good bounce from Anderson, and Hastings defends a ball at chest height"
260,"Anderson to Hastings, no run another good bouncer! Hastings looks to guide it to third man and then pulls out, well directed by Anderson"
261,"Anderson to Hastings, 1 run Hastings gets off the mark with a clip through midwicket"
262,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run Smith pushes hard to point and can only get a single"
263,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run another one is driven wide of cover by Smith, who is happy to get a few singles to start with and get his eye in"
264,"Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke goes over the top now, he's pulled deliberately high over midwicket and it just chips safely wide of the man in the deep, a couple of runs for the captain"
265,"Woakes to Clarke, 1 run drives one through cover now"
266,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run Woakes swings this one down leg and Smith clips it uppishly down to fine leg"
267,"Woakes to Clarke, OUT oh, that's a disappointing end for Clarke after he built such a good platform. He has walked at Woakes and tried to pull over midwicket, but this skies off a top edge and doesn't travel very far, Strauss runs in from cover to take a very simple"
268,"Woakes to Smith, no run cut away to point and Smith can't beat Collingwood"
269,"Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson leaves his first ball outside off"
270,"Anderson to Johnson, no run a touch slower at 131kph and Johnson drives, checking his shot just enough to avoid pushing a caught and bowled back"
271,"Anderson to Johnson, no run even slower now at 126kph, and Johnson defends this one"
272,"Anderson to Johnson, no run beaten outside off! Anderson gets some really good angle across just outside off and Johnson doesn't get the bat anywhere near it"
273,"Anderson to Johnson, no run defended - could this be a maiden?"
274,"Anderson to Johnson, no run driven to mid-off, and indeed that was a very valuable maiden over from Anderson"
275,"Finn to Smith, FOUR runs super shot! What a cracking drive through cover as he backs off a touch and thumps a pretty good ball that was full and straight, finding the gap at extra cover"
276,"Finn to Smith, no run Finn goes the slower bouncer now and Smith swipes, but can't connect"
277,"Finn to Smith, 1 run another slower ball and Smith advances, then nudges a single to cover"
278,"Finn to Hastings, FOUR runs oh, well done by Hastings as he backs away and is followed by Finn, but Hastings then swivels a pull and helps it fine enough to beat fine leg - more valuable runs"
279,"Finn to Hastings, FOUR runs another boundary as Hastings swings and throws everything at this one, getting it high over mid-off and gets enough on it to bounce over the boundary"
280,"Finn to Hastings, 1 run another slower ball and Hastings pulls hard through midwicket to the man in the deep"
281,"Anderson to Hastings, 1 run Anderson uses the slower ball now and Hastings swings hard, crashing a single down to long-on"
282,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run punched away through the off side"
283,"Anderson to Hastings, no run slower full toss now and Hastings can't get it away"
284,"Anderson to Hastings, 1 run good yorker length ball and all Hastings can do is chip a single to long-on"
285,"Anderson to Smith, 1 bye that's an interesting one from Smith! He's tried the reverse hook to Anderson! Didn't get anything on it, but Prior has fumbled and they pick up a bye"
286,"Anderson to Hastings, 1 run Hastings swings hard and gets it out through midwicket"
287,"Woakes to Hastings, OUT Woakes gets five wickets! Hastings has lifted a slower ball over midwicket but straight to Collingwood in the deep, where he takes a pretty simple catch"
288,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run another slower delivery and Smith throws the kitchen sink at this, slapping a single down to long-off"
289,"Woakes to Lee, OUT Woakes has six! And the 50th over may not be required after all. Lee has cut hard but in the air and third man takes the catch, it's the substitute fielder Luke Wright down there"
290,"Woakes to Smith, (no ball) SIX runs oh, well played Steven Smith! Another slower ball from Woakes, and Smith has waited on it, driving inside out over cover and clearing the boundary, great stroke"
291,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run driven away to point"
292,"Woakes to Bollinger, no run bouncer from Woakes, and Dougie ducks under it"
293,"Woakes to Bollinger, 1 run good yorker gives Woakes a chance, but Bollinger keeps it out and picks up a single"
294,"Trott to Bollinger, FOUR runs Bollinger begins with a boundary! He's cut hard and thereare men up in the circle at backward point and fly slip - this pierces the gap"
295,"Trott to Bollinger, 1 run crunched out to deep cover for one run, to give Smith the strike"
296,"Trott to Smith, 1 run, OUT Smith swings hard, pulls it to deep midwicket and they come back for two runs, Dougie's dive at the non-striker's end is in vain - he's short as Trott takes the throw and breaks the stumps. Australia are all out for 249."
297,"Quite right, Ian. Those are the best figures for England."
298,"It was a funny sort of innings, Watson and Haddin looked like setting a good platform, as did Hussey and Clarke later on. But batsmen kept getting out after making starts. It should be a very interesting chase. Join us for the England innings in half an hour."
299,"So, England will have to score 250 for victory here. Fantastic bowling from Chris Woakes who has finished with 6 for 45 - the second-best figures ever in ODIs for England. Not bad for a bloke in his second one-day international!"
300,"Welcome back everyone, I'm Liam Brickhill and I'll be your commentator for the beginning of the second innings. The latest news is that Shaun Marsh has injured his hamstring and won't field. Brett Lee is pawing the turf at the end of his run - he'l take the new ball. Two s"
301,"Lee to Strauss, 1 wide pacy start, but wildly inaccurate from Lee. Hurled well wide of off stump, and one of those slips was almost in action to stop that - before Haddin moved across"
302,"Lee to Strauss, no run that's better! Strauss whips his bat inside the line as Lee hits a good length on off stump. A leave, rather than a miss, but the line was great"
303,"Lee to Strauss, no run and again. Back of a length, hitting the seam and going away from the bat. Strauss watches it carefully and keeps the bat inside the line"
304,"Lee to Strauss, no run this time he is beaten! Lee goes fuller outside off, Strauss steps half forward into the drive but is beaten on the outside edge. Lee wanders down to offer him a few tips on his technique"
305,"Lee to Strauss, no run a hint of movement back into the left-hander, and good pace from the bowler too. Defended back down the track"
306,"Lee to Strauss, no run feisty stuff! Banged in short by Lee, Strauss whips his head out of the way in a hurry. He dealt with a good bouncer pretty well"
307,"Lee to Strauss, no run great finish to the over, curving gently in through the air but the pace is anything but gentle. Defended by Strauss"
308,"Bollinger to Prior, 2 leg byes off the thigh pad and down to fine leg. That's good running, as they sprint back for the second"
309,"Bollinger to Prior, no run pace and bounce, and Prior didn't know much about that! He turns his head away and thrusts the bat out in hope ... but the bouncer ricochets off the glove and grille. That's got the crowd going"
310,"Bollinger to Prior, no run it's been a spirited start by Australia's new-ball bowlers, and this time Bollinger hits a length and the ball bursts past the outside edge"
311,"Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs unorthodox, but effective! Back of a length and Prior initially set himself to pull over midwicket. The ball hit the seam and moved towards the slips, but he went through with the shot and ended up lifting it straight back over the bowle"
312,"Bollinger to Prior, no run and he follows that up with some back-foot defence"
313,"Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs slashed, and that flies over gully and down to third man for four! Prior is really flinging his bat into these shots, that was a thick edge but it raced away"
314,"Lee to Strauss, no run back of a length, with a hint of width. Strauss steps back and cracks into the off side, but straight to the cover fielder"
315,"Lee to Strauss, 1 run now the England captain is slashing up and over down to third man! Both batsmen keen to impose themselves early on, but this didn't bounce too far away from the fielder, Bollinger"
316,"Lee to Prior, no run this one leaps off a length and hits the splice as Prior hops back in defence"
317,"Lee to Prior, no run fuller this time, Prior is sat on the back foot though and drives to cover. Lee's fastest ball of the innings so far"
318,"Lee to Prior, no run and he follows it up with a much slower delivery! Spotted early by Prior, who drives to mid-on"
319,"Lee to Prior, 1 run tucked into the leg side, and they take the chance for a sprinted single"
320,"Bollinger to Prior, 1 run Prior clears the left leg and slaps down the ground ... that won't reach the boundary, however, as deep mid-off swoops to cut it off"
321,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run wobbling around on a length, just outside off. Strauss punches into the covers, but hits the field"
322,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run that's definitely hit the seam, jagging back in, and Strauss is caught in an awkward position as he sets himself for some sort of paddle-pull. The ball strikes him in the midriff and rolls into the off side"
323,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run width outside off, Strauss chops down to third man"
324,"Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs crack! All that effort from Bollinger as he charges to the crease, only to see the ball ping out of the middle of the bat and fly to the boundary in a moment. Authoritative pull from Prior, he's ticking nicely now"
325,"Bollinger to Prior, no run back of a length again, this time he opts to defend back down the track"
326,"Lee to Strauss, no run at the other end, Strauss's absorbing battle with Lee continues! The batsman backed away to leg but Lee followed him with a sharp bouncer that had him ducking for safety, and a verbal barrage to boot!"
327,"Lee to Strauss, no run tapped into the off side"
328,"Lee to Strauss, no run again Strauss targets the off side, but he can't find the gap as short cover point fields the ball on the bounce"
329,"Lee to Strauss, 1 run so instead, he tucks into the wide spaces on the leg side, picking up a single"
330,"Lee to Prior, no run close to the edge! That actually sounded like he may have got something on it, plenty of daylight between bat and ball however"
331,"Lee to Prior, OUT bowled 'im! Lee has comprehensively won this battle, firing one at the top of off. Prior's feet went nowhere, the ball bursts past his attempted nurdle to gully and makes a mess of the stumps. Lee celebrates with a hop and a kick, and that's the fir"
332,"Bollinger to Strauss, OUT two wickets in two balls! Both openers depart, England are in a hole now. Short, Strauss was quickly onto the pull but the ball didn't come off the middle of the bat, flying straight to Smith at square leg for an easy catch"
333,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run slower ball, a cutter, and it's pulled down quite short. Pietersen defends"
334,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run thick inside edge, that could so easily have gone back to hit the stumps! Luckily for Pietersen, it hits the body and bounces harmlessly towards the slips"
335,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run hurled down on a length, outside off, and left alone"
336,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs fuller, the batsman leans forward into a cautious drive and is off the mark with a scurried two"
337,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run and another good leave to end the over"
338,"Lee to Trott, OUT gone first ball! Lee strikes again! It wasn't the best ball, a touch short and angling down the leg side. Trott flicked off his hip but in the air, and Bollinger tumbles forward at short fine leg to take the catch. England are in disarray. Brett Lee"
339,"Lee to Bell, (no ball) no, short and ballooning over the ducking batsman. And what's more, he's over-stepped - it's a no-ball and his next delivery will be a Free Hit"
340,"Lee to Bell, 1 run short again, Bell flails and pops it straight up in the air. The crowd roar as Smith takes the catch, they perhaps don't quite realise what's going on ... Lee's got a smile on his face"
341,"Lee to Pietersen, 2 runs a thick outside edge bounces down to third man ... and the return from the fielder is atrocious, yorking Haddin and they come back for another"
342,"Lee to Pietersen, no run tapped into the covers"
343,"Lee to Pietersen, 1 run full, straight and fast. Pushed just wide of mid-on and they dash through for one"
344,"Lee to Bell, no run languid drive from Bell, a good-looking shot but it goes straight to the fielder"
345,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run on a length and defended by Pietersen ... who spots the opportunity for a quick single as mid-off is slow to amble in to field. Hands on hips from Bollinger"
346,"Bollinger to Bell, no run left alone outside off stump"
347,"Bollinger to Bell, no run Bell smelt that one, a bouncer bursting past his helmet and into Haddin's gloves. The 'keeper appeals, who knows why"
348,"Bollinger to Bell, no run pushed to cover point"
349,"Bollinger to Bell, 2 runs short and Bell is on the pull, that hits the splice and loops up slowly ... but it's got enough on it to evade the fielder running back from square leg"
350,"Bollinger to Bell, no run going across the right-hander on the angle, going further off the seam, and Bell leaves alone"
351,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run decent start, just short of a good length but aimed right at off stump. Pietersen gets across and defends to leg"
352,"Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs slapped straight back down the ground, the ball scorches across the turf and over the boundary. Strong shot!"
353,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run that'll have stung the hands of Hussey at short extra cover! Full and wide, absolutely slammed out the middle but straight at the fielder. He can see the funny side. Great effort to even stop that actually"
354,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run full and straight, Pietersen pushes firmly back to the bowler, who parries to his right to give away a single"
355,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run tucked off the pads into the leg side"
356,"Johnson to Pietersen, 2 runs Pietersen steps right across to the off side and clips a leg-stump delivery out into the deep ... Fine leg is up but deep square sprints across to keep them to two"
357,"Bollinger to Bell, 1 run squirted into the off side, Hussey is still close in in that catching position at cover, he dives to his left and gets a hand to it but can't quite stop the single"
358,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run offcutter from Bollinger, slower and stopping in the wicket. Pietersen pushes into the leg side"
359,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs Pietersen is counter-attacking in fine style here, lunging forward to smash this through the covers. There's no stopping that"
360,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run extravagant leave to follow that up, KP struts down to tap the wicket"
361,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run tapped to deep mid-off for one"
362,"Bollinger to Bell, 1 run flashed airily through gully! That would've resulted in a regulation catch in a Test match, but here it's a single down to third man. Keeps the bowler interested though, and that's the end of the first Powerplay"
363,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run glanced behind square on the leg side"
364,"Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs the first really testing delivery Johnson has bowled today, and it goes for four! Pietersen was caught on the crease, the ball leaving him off the pitch and taking a thick edge. That beats slip, but goes fine enough to beat third man"
365,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run defended watchfully into the off side"
366,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run direct hit would've been interesting here! Pietersen dropped it into the off side and both batsmen left their creases ... but Smith swoops in a flash and fires a shy at the non-striker's end. Bell dives, and the throw goes wide. He'd hav"
367,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run tapped to deep mid-off, and a single is taken"
368,"Johnson to Bell, no run defended down to gully off the back foot"
369,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run good start from him, this ball has just started to stick in the surface and do a little, and yet another edge flies off the bat and down to third man"
370,"Hastings to Bell, no run coming in through the air and off the seam, Bell defends with bat and pad right together"
371,"Hastings to Bell, no run aggression from Bell, charging down the track but his drive can't pierce the off side field"
372,"Hastings to Bell, no run tapped down towards cover, no single to be had"
373,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run now he does find space, running one down to third man for an easy single"
374,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen walks down and across his stumps, and aims a controlled paddle-pull to midwicket"
375,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run just past the edge! Great line from Johnson, Pietersen had to play at that. Slip, who had been moved, is back in place"
376,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run nudged into the leg side for one"
377,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run chopped down to third man"
378,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run a bit of bat, a bit of pad, and as the ball rolls to midwicket - with Johnson in hot pursuit - they scamper through for one"
379,"Johnson to Bell, (no ball) everything was right about this ball, tucking Bell up nicely in defence, except for the fact that he's been called for a no-ball. That's a bit harsh, he was certainly tight on the line but it was a borderline call. Free Hit coming up"
380,"Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs back of a length, Bell makes room and flaps over mid-off. White sprints after it but can't pull it back in time"
381,"Johnson to Bell, no run and defence to finish the over"
382,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 wide Pietersen charges down the wicket but Hastings spots him coming and responds with a canny slower-ball bouncer ... that's a bit too short though, and it's called wide"
383,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run pushed into the gap between mid-off and cover, quick single"
384,"Hastings to Bell, no run Bell is dancing down the track now, but can't get to the pitch"

386,"Hastings to Pietersen, no run full, pushed to point"
387,"Hastings to Pietersen, FOUR runs great shot, intelligent batting. Back of a length and Pietersen picks up four with the latest of late cuts, a deft little shot that beats third man"
388,"Hastings to Pietersen, no run straighter from Hastings, Pietersen taps to point"
389,"Johnson to Bell, no run Bell hops down the track and sends the ball back to the bowler ... KP had backed up quite far and Johnson was on the ball in a flash, he's safely back to his crease though"
390,"Johnson to Bell, no run tapped down, straight to the man at gully on the bounce"
391,"Johnson to Bell, no run this time it's Smith at point doing the fielding, diving to his left to stop Bell's shot. Good effort from him"
392,"Johnson to Bell, no run nicely straight from Johnson, Bell stays deep in the crease and defends"
393,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run short and pacy from Johnson, Bell is hurried as he tries to pull ... the ball hits something though, the bat handle or the glove, and they take a single"
394,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run inside edge ... the ball rolls back close to the stumps but Pietersen shows good awareness to quickly flick it away and avert the danger"
395,"Hastings to Bell, no run Bell advances and then defends"
396,"Hastings to Bell, no run Bell defends back down towards Hastings"
397,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run short ball now and Bell turns a hook around the corner to Bollinger at fine leg"

399,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run quick single now as KP walks across and nudges it wide of point"
400,"Hastings to Bell, 2 runs driven uppishly, shouts of catch it as it sails through cover but it is safe and Bell picks up two runs to the man in the deep"
401,"Smith to Pietersen, 1 run some turn away from Pietersen, who punches through cover gently for a run"
402,"Smith to Bell, 2 runs Bell advances and lofts this high but safely over cover and it lobs into the outfield"
403,"Smith to Bell, 1 run cut hard through cover to the man in the deep"
404,"Smith to Pietersen, no run a big stride forward from Pietersen as Smith drags the length back, the batsman defends"
405,"Smith to Pietersen, no run tossed up on middle stump, Pietersen clips to Hussey at short midwicket"
406,"Smith to Pietersen, no run tossed up and Pietersen drives back to Smith, who dives and nearly makes a catch, but there's no reaction from anyone. Hold on, though, Smith is saying he's not sure if he's taken it. He's come up with the ball clutched to his body. Asad R"
407,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run clipped away through square leg"
408,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run tip and run from Pietersen as he nudges to cover"

415,"Smith to Pietersen, 1 run quicker and flatter, and it's punched through cover"
416,"Smith to Bell, 2 runs well played by Bell as he takes this one off middle stump and dabs a paddle sweep fine enough to get two runs"
417,"Smith to Bell, no run tossed up on leg stump, it's clipped to midwicket"
418,"Smith to Bell, 1 run on the pads and it's tickled around the corner to short fine leg"
419,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run cut hard forward of point and another easy single"
420,"Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run slower short ball now and Pietersen pulls over midwicket"
421,"Hastings to Bell, no run walks down the pitch and dabs outside off but Hastings goes wide enough to beat the bat"
422,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run fullish and straight, Bell drives a bump ball down to mid-off, where the fielder dives across but can't stop it"
423,"Hastings to Pietersen, no run pushed to mid-off again and this time Clarke does get across to cut it off"
424,"Hastings to Pietersen, no run goes for the pull now and he can't connect"

429,"Smith to Bell, 1 run drifting in to the pads, and soft hands from KP as he nudges it to leg"
430,"Smith to Pietersen, no run good bowling, Pietersen advances and Smith sends it in flatter and quicker, the batsman has to check his shot again"
431,"Hastings to Bell, no run lovely fielding by David Hussey at gully, as he launches himself to his right to save a good late cut from Bell that might have run away to the boundary"
432,"Hastings to Bell, 1 run slower ball now, which is chipped through square leg and they can't justify a second run"
433,"Hastings to Pietersen, 2 runs driven hard through cover for another easy run"
434,"Hastings to Pietersen, OUT Pietersen is gone! Oh, John Hastings has done it with the slower bouncer! It has absolutely stopped in mid-air on the way to Pietersen, who wants to pull hard but is playing too quickly and ends up swinging one-handed and gets a top edge t"
435,"Hastings to Morgan, no run on the pads and Morgan can't get it away"
436,"Hastings to Morgan, 1 run good yorker now but Morgan manages to drive it wide of cover to get off the mark"
437,"Smith to Morgan, 1 run tossed up well outside off and Morgan steps across to work it through the leg side"
438,"Smith to Bell, no run good flight from Smith, and Bell uses the feet and then drives to mid-on"
439,"Smith to Bell, no run cut away to point and can't find the gap"
440,"Smith to Bell, 1 run driven to long-off for a comfortable single"
441,"Smith to Morgan, OUT another one goes! Morgan has holed out to Smith! Not a very clever piece of batting, you'd have to say, as he gets underneath a lofted drive and skies it to long-off, where Johnson runs around to his right and takes a catch that nearly bobbles o"
442,"Smith to Bell, no run Bell reaches at this one and pushes to point"
443,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood is beaten outside off first ball, there's no foot movement there as he just tries to dab a cut away"

453,"Smith to Bell, 1 run a bit of a long hop here but it's not put away as Bell pulls a single down towards long-on"
454,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood defends solidly"
455,"Hastings to Bell, no run Bell tries to dab a cut away fine but this one beats the bat"
456,"Hastings to Bell, no run driven hard but straight to mid-off"
457,"Hastings to Bell, no run slower ball - and much slower at 104kph - and it's driven to mid-on"
458,"Hastings to Bell, OUT gone! Bell has played on and Hastings has got rid of both the well-set batsmen in KP and Bell. This one swings in and Bell tries for the late cut, the movement does him in and his bottom edge runs on to the off stump"
459,"Hastings to Woakes, 1 run Woakes gets off the mark straight away with a thickish edge to third man"
460,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, 1 run fullish and angling in to Collingwood, who gets a single as his drive is knocked down at short cover"

464,"Smith to Woakes, 1 run another one is driven through the off side, this time through the gap at cover"

468,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run driven towards mid-off this time and can't find the gap"
469,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs a good shot now from Collingwood, he's just forced this flick wide of mid-on, just placed well enough to find the gap and it runs away for a boundary"
470,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, 2 runs soft hands now as Collingwood clips through midwicket and races back for two runs"
471,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run bouncer, and this one looked too high but the umpires have been very lenient today on such decisions and again a wide is not called"
472,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, 1 wide but this one is called a wide as Collingwood walks across outside off and Hastings sends it much wider"
473,"Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run beaten outside off, just a good length delivery that angles in and Collingwood played the wrong line"
474,"Smith to Woakes, no run pushed back to the bowler who does his own fielding"
475,"Smith to Woakes, no run cut to backward point where White does the fielding"

478,"Smith to Woakes, 1 run pushed down to long-off now and another single"
479,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run oooh, a touch edgy here as Collingwood leans forward and gets it off the shoulder of the bat, the ball lobs up but well short of Smith"
480,"Johnson to Woakes, 1 run banged in on the hips and it's clipped uppishly to square leg"
481,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run again it's soft hands from Collingwood, who nudges a single to midwicket"

488,"Smith to Woakes, 1 run pushed down to long-off, where Bollinger does the fielding"
489,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched wide of cover this time"
490,"Smith to Woakes, 1 run well flighted by Smith and Woakes goes for the dab sweep around the corner"
491,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run pushed straight to Clarke at cover"
492,"Johnson to Woakes, no run pushed right across Woakes, who tries for the square drive but can't connect"
493,"Johnson to Woakes, no run beaten outside off this time"
494,"Johnson to Woakes, no run opens the face and tries to run a single through point but just finds the fielder"

497,"Johnson to Woakes, no run and that's a maiden, as Woakes defends the last ball"

499,"Watson to Woakes, no run pushed away defensively to the off side"
500,"Watson to Woakes, no run tickled down leg side and is that a dropped chance? Haddin diving to his left has missed the take with his left hand, but it's hard to see what that has come off - perhaps off the trousers. Not bat."
501,"Watson to Woakes, no run pushed away defensively"
502,"Watson to Woakes, no run tries to force this through leg but can't connect"
503,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run sharp bouncer greets Shahzad! He wears it on the chest, and there are plenty of words being flung around too"

505,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run Johnson re-adjusts his line, a nervous waft from the batsman"
506,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run Shahzad is forward and driving without any great conviction, and he's easily beaten on the outside edge"
507,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run Johnson is firing it past the edge at will when he gets it right, as he does now. Shahzad's feet go nowhere as he stands at the crease to defend"
508,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run the bowler attacks the stumps, this time the bat comes down in time to keep the ball out"
509,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run pushed full again but slightly wider of off, yet again the ball flies past the edge of the bat"
510,"Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump, Anderson sways out of the way"
511,"Watson to Anderson, (no ball) another bouncer from Watson, this is much too short and balloons over the batsman"
512,"Watson to Anderson, no run back of a length, outside off and oast the edge"
513,"Watson to Anderson, no run another nervous swish from Anderson, not sure how much longer England's tail can survive these conditions"

515,"Watson to Anderson, no run booming cover drive this time ... but he hits nothing but fresh air"
516,"Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump to end the over, Anderson tries to uppercut it but again can't get a touch on it. Watto wanders down and stares in disbelief. Could easily have a had a third wicket any number of times in this over"
517,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run on a length, but outside off and Shahzad leaves alone"
518,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run dug in shorter and much faster by Johnson, the ball rises on Shahzad but he rides the bounce and plays it down to gully"
519,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run bouncer from Johnson! He's got Shahzad hopping nervously, and the umpire calls one for the over with a wide smile on his face"
520,"Johnson to Shahzad, no run this one hits the seam and jags away, past the edge for the umpteenth time"
521,"Johnson to Shahzad, 1 run aimed at the top of middle, nudged to short third man and there's utter confusion between the three Englishmen out there - Shahzad has a runner remember - which really should've resulted in a run-out. The throw is wide, however"
522,"Johnson to Anderson, no run just short of a length, tapped down to point"
523,"Watson to Shahzad, no run appeal as a good bouncer hits something on the way throught to Haddin ... was that off the shoulder? Not off the bat, reckons Umpire Rauf, and calls one for the over"
524,"Watson to Shahzad, 1 run nudged off the hip, and an easy single into the leg side"
525,"Watson to Anderson, 1 run and Anderson rotates the strike straight away with another quick single"
526,"Watson to Shahzad, (no ball) great line and length from Watson, again he's past the edge, but he's over-stepped so the next ball is going to be a Free Hit"
527,"Watson to Shahzad, SIX runs Shahzad takes full toll, swinging mightily to send a length ball sailing over wide long-on! 84 metre boundary there"

532,"Bollinger to Shahzad, no run tapped down defensively to gully, nothing in the batsman's half"
533,"Bollinger to Shahzad, no run there's spite and malice in this bouncer! Shahzad was in no position to play it, throwing the hands out. The ball takes the splice of the bat and lobs up, falling just past the stumps"
534,"Bollinger to Shahzad, no run yet again past the edge. Surely, eventually, he'll get a touch on one of these?"
535,"Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump, Anderson gives himself room and flashes wildly, play-and-a-miss"

538,"Watson to Anderson, no run fuller, wider, and driven off the toe of the bat to cover"
539,"Watson to Anderson, FOUR runs that one's come out of the middle! Smeared over mid-on by Anderson, one bounce and over the rope"
540,"Watson to Anderson, no run well, he was aiming to send this one into the stratosphere, just shutting his eyes and heaving wildly to leg. Nowhere near it"
541,"Bollinger to Finn, no run full on off stump, Finn taps to mid-on"
542,"Bollinger to Finn, no run England's No. 11 is ducking now as Bollinger sends down a bouncer. One for the over, says the umpire"
543,"Bollinger to Finn, 3 runs not the worst shot by Finn, backing away and cracking a length delivery up and over cover. Not enough on it to reach the boundary, however"
544,"Bollinger to Anderson, FOUR runs slap! Anderson is starting to middle a couple now. He comes charging down the wicket and smashes this through extra cover"
545,"Bollinger to Anderson, 1 run slower ball from Bollinger, not picked at all by Anderson who is through with the shot before the ball gets to him, but they pick up one into the leg side all the same"
546,"Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs England's tailenders are enjoying themselves now! Just short of a good length, Finn just opens his stance and swings this straight down the ground, standing to admire the shot as the ball sails away"

548,"Lee to Anderson, 1 run tapped down just to gully's right, they hurry through for one"
549,"Lee to Finn, no run short, and Finn is left lying on the ground in ungainly fashion as he gets out of the way of that. Slower-ball bouncer. Finn obviously likes the feel of the wicket against his derriere, he falls over enough when he's bowling"
550,"Lee to Finn, no run short again, dealt with much more effectively this time"
551,"Lee to Finn, no run fired full and straight, but Finn's bat comes down in good time"
552,"Lee to Finn, 1 run on a length around off stump, Finn gives himself some room and cracks it towards mid-off. Clarke does well to cut the shot off"
553,"Bollinger to Finn, no run just short of a good length, Finn positions himself for an ambitious pull but the ball flies between bat and body and through to the keeper"
554,"Bollinger to Finn, 1 run full and straight, swiped across the line into the leg side"

556,"Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs heaved into the leg side, that's found the gap and Finn collects another boundary!"
557,"Bollinger to Finn, no run now he's charging down the track and slogging wildly, Bollinger pushes it slightly wider of off and Finn gets nowhere near it"
558,"Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs straight back over the bowler's head, baseball style! Well, England may not have any chance of winning this, but the batsman are having fun. Making a bit of dosh for charity too, which is good"
559,"Lee to Anderson, 1 run slashed down to third man for one"
560,"Lee to Finn, no run big swing, big miss"
561,"Lee to Finn, no run Finn is knocked off his feet by a searing yorker! Somehow he's found a way to keep that out..."

564,"Lee to Finn, FOUR runs another slower ball, this time he spots it and clobbers it over midwicket!"
565,"Bollinger to Anderson, (no ball) ooh, that's nasty. That's slipped out as a very high full toss - a beamer really - at about sternum height. The ball evades Haddin too"
566,"Bollinger to Anderson, no run that's more like it. On a length and aimed at the stumps, tapped to gully"
567,"Bollinger to Anderson, no run Anderson gives himself acres of room as Bollinger fires in a yorker outside off, in fact Anderson has given himself so much room that he almost tumbles over towards square leg. Nowhere near hitting it"
568,"Bollinger to Anderson, 1 run tapped straight to Hussey at cover, they set off for a suicidal single and the throw is wide"
569,"Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs another boundary for Finn! He picks up the length early and swings this away to wide midwicket"

571,"Bollinger to Anderson, no run Anderson backs away, trying to open up the off side, but completely misses a length delivery from Bollinger"
572,"Lee to Finn, 3 runs well Finn has got an excellent connection on this one too! Full and straight from Lee, the batsman cracks it in the air to wide long-on and only a great piece of fielding from Hastings saves the boundary"
573,"Lee to Anderson, no run yorker, outside off, and it slips right under Anderson's bat"
574,"Lee to Anderson, no run back of a length, Anderson tries to run it down to third man but ball beats bat"
575,"Lee to Anderson, 2 runs Anderson backs right away to leg and slashes a square drive out into the deep. They run hard and are easily back for the second when the throw arrives at the stumps"
576,"Lee to Anderson, no run full and straight, Anderson defends awkwardly to cover"
577,"Lee to Anderson, no run on a length, angling across the left-hander and he pulls his bat inside the line to leave"

579,"Watson to Finn, no run just past the off stump! Finn looked like a batsman hitting that six, now he's a tailender as he closes his eyes and swings wildly to leg"
580,"That's all from your commentary team, George Binoy, Brydon Coverdale and Liam Brickhill. Join us again for the 6th match of the series at Sydney on Wednesday (14:20 local, 03:20 GMT). Until then, goodbye!"
581,"""The reason we haven't got it right, I'm not sure, but hopefully we can use the last two games to fix our problems. Morgs [Eoin Morgan] has struggled, but you can't put it on his shoulders. Apart from Trott none of the batsmen have been great. We've played very badly, we c"

583,"So, some consolation for Australia after the Ashes with a one-day series win secured with two games to spare. It was a team effort from them with both bat and ball today, Michael Clarke finding some semblance of form with his half-century. It looked like England would push"
