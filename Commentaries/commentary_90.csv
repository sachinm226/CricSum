16,"Starc to Babar Azam, OUT Given out LBW. He's been given and Babar reviews. This was full and shaping into the pad late. There was a big appeal and it carried to slip. There's no bat involved. Nothing on hot spot. RTS appears to say pad only. Daylight between bat and ball. Ball tracking is a little slow. We have to wait 30 seconds for ball tracking. Ball tracking s"
17,"Starc to Rizwan, OUT Bowled him! Searing 140kph inswinger! This was like a heat-seeking missile. Started on off, swung late through a gaping gate as he tried to drive away from his body. His pads were outside leg, his bat outside off, the ball swerved through and crashed into middle and leg"

52,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, no run pulled belligerently but no timing, straight to mid-on"

54,"Stanlake to Khushdil, 1 run fuller length, steered to midwicket"
55,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, 1 run driven to mid-off, pair scuttle through for another quick single. This is good stuff from Australia"
56,"Stanlake to Khushdil, no run excellent over. Pakistan really going nowhere at the moment, and the pressure Iftikhar feels is understandable. His wicket could be the game"
57,"Agar to Iftikhar, 1 run chipper to long-off"
58,"Agar to Khushdil, no run straight back to the bowler"
59,"Agar to Khushdil, 2 runs the reverse sweep comes out. No timing, but that allows Pakistan to come back for two"

61,"Agar to Iftikhar, 1 run runs it to backward point for a single"
62,"Agar to Khushdil, 1 run poked to fine leg, and another tidy over concludes"
63,"Kane Richardson to Khushdil, OUT this won't help improve their mood! Khushdil cleared his front leg and looked to tonk this into the stands behind midwicket. It went so high the keeper thought he might catch it, but in the end Starc at fine leg got himself into position and snared a swirling one. Pakistan lose half their side."
64,"Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, FOUR runs short and wide, and finally a boundary comes! The width allowed Iftikhar to slash at it, and it races to the third man boundary"
65,"Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, no run better delivery, defended"

72,"Agar to Imad Wasim, 1 run a whack down the ground, but again, got very little of the middle of the bat on it"
73,"Agar to Iftikhar, 1 run guided to square leg, Agar has been so tight today. Fantastic spin bowling."
74,"Agar to Imad Wasim, 1 run excellent over once more. Just what Australia needed after a slightly expensive one from Richardson"
75,"Abbott to Imad Wasim, 1 run Imad goes down the ground, the length is dragged back, and he can only splice it to the onside for one"
76,"Abbott to Iftikhar, 1 run good timing, but Abbott is bowling short of a length at pace, and Iftikhar doesn't have enough time to get underneath it"
77,"Abbott to Imad Wasim, OUT gone! What a catch! Agar can't put a foot wrong today. Not a surprise, in truth. Nothing had been working for Imad in the short time he'"
78,"Abbott to Iftikhar, no run Shadab nearly got himself run out. No communication between the two, and Shadab at the non-striker's end would have been gone with a direct hit"
79,"Abbott to Iftikhar, 1 run steered to third man"
80,"Abbott to Shadab, no run blocks and sets off rather aimlessly, Iftikhar knows better than to take him up on the offer."
81,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, 1 run Scooped into the vacant legside infield from Iftikhar. think he was looking to get it into a deserted enough area to come back for two"
82,"Stanlake to Shadab, no run Pace and bounce. Lovely stuff from Stanlake. Tentative poke and a miss"
83,"Stanlake to Shadab, 1 run Nudged to short backward point and Shadab gets himself off strike"
84,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, no run excellent bowling again. Short and Iftikhar didn't quite know what to do with it. Lucky he didn't edge it straight back to the bowler. Almost comes back and hits his stumps, the batsman had to stop it with his bat"
85,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, 1 run pulled to fine leg"
86,"Stanlake to Shadab, no run makes room for himself and Stanlake throws it well outside off stump. Never quite in position to execute the extravagant cut, and it's another swing and a miss"
87,"Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, OUT massive blow for Pakistan! Heaved down to fine leg from Iftikhar. He'd been struggling with the short ball for much of the innings, and Starc at fine leg was secure as ever. Richardson, who copped such heavy punishment from Iftikhar last game, get's his revenge"
88,"Kane Richardson to Shadab, no run clattered straight to point"
89,"Kane Richardson to Shadab, no run swing and a miss. Shadab one off six now. Needs to kick on badly"
90,"Kane Richardson to Shadab, no run copy and paste. This time he tried a swivel-pull, but Carey gathers it behind the stumps again"
91,"Kane Richardson to Shadab, OUT the miserable innings comes to an end! Well, colour me surprised! Shadab had been struggling badly all eight balls he was there, and this time, he got a thick edge. Mid-on made a bit of a meal of it, but that's it for the allrounder"
92,"Kane Richardson to Mohammad Hasnain, FOUR runs wow, what was that from Hasnain! No double wicket maiden for Richardson, as Hasnain middles his first ball for an exquisite cover drive that goes straight to the boundary! Watch and learn, Imad and Shadab, the teenager might meekly mutter to himself"
93,"Starc to Amir, 1 wide dragged down legside"
94,"Starc to Amir, no run backs away, does Amir, and tentatively times it back down the ground"
95,"Starc to Amir, SIX runs that's better! First maximum of the night. Amir backs away again, but it was the shorter delivery that allowed Amir to get a thick edge on it, which carried all the way over the third man boundary"
96,"Starc to Amir, no run straight to the fielder"
97,"Starc to Amir, 1 run yorker, Amir digs it out and the pair change ends"
98,"Starc to Mohammad Hasnain, no run he was barely in the same postcode. Looked to repeat the shot he played so well off Richardson, but the shorter length renders it impossible"
99,"Starc to Mohammad Hasnain, no run yorker that just misses leg stump"
100,"Stanlake to Haris Sohail, 1 run 147kph, over-pitched, he drives very nicely straight of mid off, Warner moves like a hare across the turf to dive and make the save"
101,"Stanlake to Iftikhar, 1 run 142kph, angled into leg, he glances this to fine leg with ease"
102,"Stanlake to Haris Sohail, no run 142kph, bouncer, over leg stump, he ducks under it easily"

106,"Stanlake to Haris Sohail, 1 run 138kph, shorter length, into the ribs, he tucks this to fine leg"
107,"Agar to Haris Sohail, OUT caught at long off! That was brilliant from Agar. Haris jumped down early, Agar dragged the length down, Haris went through with the shot, mistimed it trying to launch over long off, he clothed it straight down Richardson's throat at long off. Easy catch 15 metres in off the rope"
108,"Agar to Khushdil, 1 run tossed up slower, he works with the turn towards long on, he pushes for two but it's not on"
109,"Agar to Iftikhar, 1 run drifting into middle, he's back and working this through midwicket"
110,"Agar to Khushdil, 1 run drifting outside off, he drives, without timing past cover to the sweeper in the deep"
111,"Agar to Iftikhar, 1 run tossed up, he pushes gently to cover point for one"
112,"Agar to Khushdil, 1 run shorter length, he's back and cutting to backward point"
113,"Kane Richardson to Amir, 1 run run down to third man"
114,"Kane Richardson to Mohammad Hasnain, no run Carbon copy. Hasnain might have to consider descending from cloud nine, where he might still be after that lovely cover drive first ball. Needs to rotate the strike"
115,"Kane Richardson to Mohammad Hasnain, no run but who cares what I think? Another lavish swing, another obvious miss. One off four balls this over"
116,"Kane Richardson to Mohammad Hasnain, no run four in a row. Nothing connecting for Hasnain now, and Amir can only watch from the other end"
117,"Kane Richardson to Mohammad Hasnain, no run swing and a miss. Hasnain has clearly decided that is all he wants to do. top stuff from Richardson. Just one off that over"
118,"Abbott to Amir, no run short ball, Amir ducks below it"
119,"Abbott to Amir, no run Amir backed away to try and cut it through the covers. Misses again. That's seven balls in a row the bat hasn't made contact with the ball"
120,"Abbott to Amir, no run make that eight! Amir looks to scoop this over fine leg. Doesn't even make contact with it"
121,"Abbott to Amir, 1 run hallelujah, there's bat on ball! And there's even a ticking over of the scores. They take a single. A SINGLE! What will Australia do now?"
122,"Abbott to Mohammad Hasnain, no run Hasnain swings like a rusty gate, as they say these days. Just one off five balls this final over"
123,"Abbott to Mohammad Hasnain, no run and ends, predictably, with another miss. Two off the final two overs, and on a miserable evening in Perth, Pakistan limp to 106. They trudge off, no sign of a spring in their step, while Australia are practically prancing off the field. This should be comfortable for them"
124,"Either way, join us in 20 minutes or so, where Alex will take you through the first ten overs of that innings!"
125,"And if it isn't, then you'll know Pakistan's bowlers will be at their legendary, mythical best. That should be worth a watch, but you really have to be the optimistic sort, and from the evidence of the feedback I'm receiving, there's little evidence of that."
126,We're not far away from the start of the chase. Can Pakistan pull off a miracle? They will need something special. It will be interesting to see how Hasnain and Musa go on a surface with a lot of pace and bounce.
127,Finch and Warner stride out. Amir will open the bowling. Two slips in.
128,"Amir to Warner, no run 130kph, perfect length, touch of shape away, he's squared up pushing to point"
129,"Amir to Warner, no run 132kph, good length angled in, it comes off the thigh pad"
130,"Amir to Warner, SIX runs top edge just carries over third man's head! Why was Hasnain off the rope? If he was on the rope he catches that at waist high! It was short and wide but the extra bounce caused the top edge to fly all the way to third man but it's six instead of a wicket"
131,"Amir to Warner, no run full angled into leg, he pushes to mid on"
132,"Amir to Warner, no run huge mix up and Imam misses! He did everything right. Warner crunches a cut shot, Imam makes an unbelievable diving save and Warner had taken off thinking he beat him, Imam got up had all the time he needed to throw the stumps down and missed"
133,"Amir to Warner, no run back of a length, he pushes this to cover-point"
134,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run back of a length, climbing outside off, and it comes off the stickers as he defends. He was surprised at 137kph"
135,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run 142kph, beats him. Beaten for pace. Feet were anchored, he pushed at it and it zipped past the edge"
136,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, FOUR runs long half volley and he caresses a square drive through point. Finch had no trouble here. Just placed the gift through the gap"
137,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run 142kph, good length, top of off, he is forced to defend back to the bowler"
138,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run 139kph, back of a length, middle and off, he punches off the back foot but drags it to mid on"

145,"Amir to Finch, 1 run back of a length outside off, he's back and punching this to wide mid off and running sharply for an easy one"

147,"Amir to Warner, no run 125kph, slower outswinger, he's back and jabbing a cut to point"
148,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run 147kph, very full on off, Finch is hanging back, left leg out of the way, he mistimes a drive to mid off"
149,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, 1 run 143kph, full on off, he swings hard trying to hit down the ground, gets a thick inside edge that runs behind square"
150,"Muhammad Musa to Warner, 1 run 145kph, very full outside off, he squeezes a push into cover for a single"
151,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, SIX runs hooked for six off the top edge. 143kph, bouncer right at the helmet, but fine leg is up, Finch swivelled and was hurried but the top edge goes all the way"
152,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, FOUR runs short and wide and cracked forward of point! It was in the air at a catchable height but wide of the man. Just a bad ball and met with a flashing blade"
153,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, 1 run 140kph, chest high short ball, he ropes a pull at speed flat but short of the deep square on the fence"
154,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, no run 141kph, good length, angled into the thigh pad, it comes off the thigh and runs to short fine"
155,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, no run 146kph, outswinger outside off, back of a length, he's beaten fending away from his body"

157,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, SIX runs pulled over square leg! Cracking shot. Finch at his best. Shoulder high short ball outside off, he was back set up to hammer it, got it out of the screws and cleared the man on the rope easily!"
158,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run 142kph, good length on middle, he pushes this neatly straight of mid on"
159,"Mohammad Hasnain to Warner, 1 run 145kph, shorter length on middle, he leans back and lets it run off the angled bat to third man"
160,"Amir to Warner, 1 run 126kph, angled into leg, he works this off his pads square of midwicket for a single"
161,"Amir to Finch, no run good length on off, he pushes to mid off, he calls yes but then sends Warner back quickly"
162,"Amir to Finch, 1 run 136kph, back of a length outside off, he's back and mistiming a back foot drive wide of mid off"
163,"Amir to Warner, FOUR runs 138kph, low full toss, he just punches it for four straight down the ground. That was a little too easy"
164,"Amir to Warner, 1 wide 135kph, predictable bouncer and it's too high"
165,"Amir to Warner, FOUR runs 139kph, short ball, he rolls with a pull shot and the placement and timing is superb. He beats the two men on the rope. Picked the gap perfectly"

177,"Imad Wasim to Warner, SIX runs in the slot, he stands and launches it over long on into the stands! It was caught in the crowd! This was just lobbed up in the arc, Warner spotted it, stood still and teed off. He got it out of the screws"

195,"Mohammad Hasnain to Warner, 1 wide short again. Warner watches it go by while fixing the umpire with a piercing look, who obliges and calls it awide"
196,"Mohammad Hasnain to Warner, 1 run didn't middle this, flew through to deep cover, where Iftikhar was racing in. Falls slightly short though, meaning the possibility of a 10-wicket win is still very much on"
197,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run stroked to mid-off"
198,"Mohammad Hasnain to Warner, 1 run slower ball once more. Tidy over so far, this, but Australia just eight runs away"
199,"Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run attempted pull by Finch, and the inside edge clips it onto his pads. He keeps the strike. Into the 12th over we go now"
200,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, 1 wide Finch thought about walloping this, but realised just in time he was getting a free run. 5 away from his half-century"
201,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, 2 runs misfield allows the Australian openers to come back for two. Four away from as eries win, each batsman three away from 50"
202,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, no run brilliant stop at backward point from Shadab. He's an excellent fielder in that position, one of the best in the world, in truth"
203,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, 1 run low full toss, Finch drives through the air to long-on on the bounce. Right, three to win. Will Warner get his half-century instead, then?"
204,"Muhammad Musa to Warner, 1 run not yet, nurdles it down to fine leg"
205,"Muhammad Musa to Finch, FOUR runs and that brings it to an end! 50 for Finch, a series win for Australia. This is a blinding performance from the hosts against the world's number one team. They've made them look astonishingly pedestrian, and should do their confidence the world of good before the Test series. There's no sugar-coating this"
206,"Australia keep their unbeaten T20 streak in 2019 intact. Pakistan never looked like threatening that, in reality. The 2-0 scoreline actually flatters Pakistan; Australia would have romped home in the first T20, surely. Many thought Pakistan would be a sterner test for Australia than Sri Lanka, but if anything, Babar Azam's men have rolled over even more easily. The pace"
207,"We're with you for the presentations, hopefully, and we'll bring you what the captains had to say after an exceptionally one-sided game here in Perth"
208,The player of the series is Steve Smith; I suppose the innings in the second T20I was good enough to merit it.
209,"Right, so here come the presentations. The player of the match is Sean Abbott. Fantastic on his return to international cricket; first game for Australia in 5 years."
210,"So Australia finish 2019 unbeaten in the shortest format, and within 12 months, have propelled themselves to among the hottest favourites for the World T20 next year. For now, they celebrate with the trophy, and it's time for us to sign off here. From Danyal and Alex, goodbye, and many thanks for joining us."
211,"""It's pleasing one of our top three batted really deep throughout the two series, and we can only kick on from here."""
212,Australia won by 10 wickets (with 49 balls remaining)
213,"Player of the match is Sean Abbott, AUS"
