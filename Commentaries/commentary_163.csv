22,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, OUT Australia find reward for their tight lines and lengths with the new ball. Coulter-Nile puts it on a length and wide outside off, swings away further - it ended on a set of stumps outside off. Rahane throws his bat at a drive and only snicks it behind. Wade, who has been busy this afternoon, moves to his right and snags the catch. Rahane falls for 5 off 15 balls on return"
23,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run very, very full and wide outside off, just inside the tramline, asking Kohli to drive. The Indian captain says 'Nah, not now'"

32,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, OUT Kohli can't get away. Maxwell at backward point pulls off a belting one-handed catch over his head. Kohli has been dismissed for a four-ball duck. This was full and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off again. Kohli had left his first ball. He chased the second one with a big drive. The big drive comes out again, he slices it into the air. Maxwell propels himself at backward point, sticks out his right hand, and grabs the ball, and lands. Great r"
33,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run dug in short on off, 140.8ks, Pandey fends it off"
34,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, OUT Is Pandey out nicking behind as well? Australia are sure they have their man and keep celebrating... but umpire Erasmus asks them to hold on. Was it a bump ball?

98,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, no run good length at off stump, defended to extra cover"
99,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, OUT holes out to deep square leg. An ordinary shot. Stoinis has been easily picked off with short bowling. But this one is 5 kph quicker than the last ball. Rohit goes for the hook, but the ball is way outside off. It's a regulation top edge and a regulation reverse-cup for Coulter-Nile. Umpires check for no-ball, but the crowd has already begun shouting Dhoni! Dhoni!"
100,"Zampa to Dhoni, 2 runs a misfield and he's way! A slip was on place for Dhoni. This is back of a length and lifting away from outside off. He gets a thick outside edge and backward point lets it through"

118,"Faulkner to Dhoni, (no ball) FOUR runs slower, short ball on the leg stump, all Dhoni has to do is to pull it away to the fine-leg boundary. Well, well, it's a front-foot no-ball as well"
119,"Faulkner to Dhoni, no run Faulkner aims for a yorker, goes too full on the pads, Dhoni picks it up with his powerful wrists and whips it with the bottom hand over square leg. Coulter-Nile slides to his right and stops the ball. Dhoni did not even run"
120,"Faulkner to Dhoni, SIX runs he doesn't need to run when he can launch it for sixes. This is vintage Dhoni and the crowd soaks it in. He surges down the track, meets a length ball outside off and lifts it imperiously over long-off"
121,"Faulkner to Dhoni, no run back-of-the-hand slower delivery outside off, Dhoni aims for a club over midwicket. No dice. Beaten"
122,"Faulkner to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni forays down the track again... this time holes out to long-off. Faulkner's front foot is fine. Faulker pulled his length back, seeing Dhoni step out, on off stump. Dhoni gets it high on the bat and splices it to Warner for a head-high catch"

125,"Coulter-Nile and Cummins found swing and bounce in the early exchanges and made light work of India's top order. Kedar Jadhav flickered briefly before Hardik Pandya and MS Dhoni staged a remarkable recovery. Pandya teed off against Zampa, smashing four successive boundaries. After Pandya fell for a career-best 83, Dhoni took over, brought up a fifty of his own. From 11 for 3 and then 87 for 5, India finish at 281 for 7 on a two-paced pitch. Be back in 40 minutes for Australia's reply"
126,"Hardik Pandya: It feels pretty amazing to be honest. They were on top, and the pressure was there. We lost wickets, and it was important for me to make a partnership with MSD. I mean, I have learnt a lot from him, still learning. We were speaking how we needs to change things up. It is a pleasure to play with him. I was trying to hit out before the Zampa over as well. Generally my plan is hitting straight - I don't care if long-off is there or long-on is there. If I connect well, I know"
127,Earlier today PV Sindhu avenged herself against Nozomi Okuhara at the Korea Open and brought their developing rivalry to an even keel.
128,5.30pm There is a slight drizzle in Chennai. Our correspondent Arun Venugopal says the square is being covered.
129,5:55pm Rain isn't going away any time soon. The start will be delayed. More details soon. Another 35 minutes before we start losing overs.
130,Arun has good news: The covers are coming off the square. Chepauk is in whistle-podu mode.
131,6:32pm Arun: India's support staff waste no time in setting up the stumps and other paraphernalia on the adjacent practice wicket. Bumrah and Chahal are having a bowl now
132,"6:34pm Well, it seems we have lost overs, despite the earlier announcement. It seems Australia's slow over rate (26-27 minutes late) has cost them the 30 minutes. So, as per the rules we will now have a 43-over second innings. We're hearing that the revised target is 260. I'll give you a confirmation on that soon. The match will resume at 7 pm."
133,6:48pm Scratch everything I said. The covers are coming back on. Giant sigh.
134,"Arun at Chepauk: It's only a very slight drizzle, but annoyingly for the fans it is persistent."
135,"7:06pm 'The drizzle has intensified now and the crowd senses that the game won't start anytime soon'. Guess who? Arun, your principal correspondent for bad news."
136,R Ashwin turns 31 today. Do you think we will see him mostly in whites in the coming years?
137,"Arun, 7:19pm The Indian fielders are huddled near the boundary. There are signs of the Australian yellow too. Boy, this is a tease."
138,"7:20pm Play will resume at 7.25pm. The target is 238 in 37 overs. Two bowlers can bowl a maximum of eight overs. Powerplay 1: 1-8, overs, PP2: 9-30 overs, PP3: 31-37 overs."
139,"7:24pm Oh dear. Just as the batsmen walk up to the pitch, the rain's come down again. The covers have been pulled back on."
140,"7:26pm You can scream the expletives on my behalf. There's some confusion. India are still on the field. For a moment, the groundsmen pause as they come on with the cover. The umpires ask them to stop. Then Kohli pesters them. Then Smith walks out and shrugs, aggressively. Then, the covers come on anyway. India are still on the field, though."
141,"7:27pm Okay, now the Indian team is walking back into the dressing room."
142,7:30pm Just over an hour remaining before this game can be called off. Some time around 8:34pm according to the Chepauk scorers.
143,"More drizzle news from Arun, who says it has intensified. And some input from Sid Monga who said before Arun's update that this is the kind of rain where play would have continued if it had already been on."
144,"Arun, Chepauk man: A message on the giant screen asking fans to whistle podu for Dhoni elicits a resounding collection of whistles."
145,"8:01pm, Arun, Chepauk weatherman: Covers are off, super soppers are on, stumps planted. Where have we heard that before? Just over thirty minutes left."
146,"8:12pm, Arun, Chepauk thala: If you are chewing your nails and tearing your hair out, you won't be judged. It's inexplicable how nothing more than a few droplets of rain have held up play for more than two hours now."
147,8:19pm India are out on the field. We're hearing of an 8:30pm resumption. The revised target will be 164 in 21 overs in that case.
148, Powerplay 3: 18-21.
149,8:28pm David Warner has just taken his leg stump guard. Cartwright is opening with him. Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the ball. One slip catching.
150,The bounce is still in there
151,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length, swinging in at the pads. Tucked to midwicket who is close in"
152,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length, shaped in at middle stump. Defended off the back foot into the leg side"
153,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 wide good length, swinging down leg side and past his attempted flick"
154,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length, bending in at the thigh guard. Late to get his bat around and he awkwardly bunts it into the leg side"
155,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length outside off, just angle this time, no swing. Pushed to point with an open face"
156,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run slower ball, full outside off stump. Looks to clatter it through the off side but he's forced to check his drive. A knuckle ball from the bowler"
157,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run back of a length at off stump, lifts off after pitching. Takes the thick outside edge but he was playing with soft hands. Dribbles backward of point and they run through"
158,"Bumrah to Warner, FOUR runs shot. Beautiful from Warner. This is overpitched on off stump. His front leg's out of the way but the bat comes down nice and straight. Punched past mid-off"
159,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run back of a length on the pads, skids in quickly. Nudged off the inside edge to short fine, via thigh guard"
160,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run back of a length at middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
161,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run lovely line. Good length and angled into the corridor. Late on this forward push as it straightens and zips past the outside edge"
162,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run length and into the pads. Looks to tickle this fine, but he can only get pad on it. Dhoni collects down leg side. Feeble appeal is turned down"
163,"Bumrah to Cartwright, no run back of a length in the corridor, defended into the covers"
164,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run slower ball, full and wide. Chases it with hard hands. Can only slice it to deep point. Uppish, but safe"
165,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, no run narrowly misses the off stump. Superb seam presentation. Good length, in at off stump and just flies through from above as Cartwright offers a big gap between bat and pad on his push"
166,"Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, 1 run outside edge falls short of slip. Length and swinging away from the corridor. Wafts at it on the up and gets a big edge that lands to Rohit Sharma's right. He parries it towards third man"
167,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, FOUR runs length and swinging into the pads. Warner leaps to smother the bounce and whips it well to the left of deep square. Used his wrists and timed that perfectly"
168,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run full and swinging away from middle. Whips against the angle, straight to midwicket"
169,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of a length, swinging into his mid-riff. Bit of theatrics from Warner in his stance. But he can't tuck this past midwicket who hares to his right after Warner pushed towards mid-on"
170,"Bumrah to Cartwright, 1 leg bye offcutter, good length and in at off stump. Cops him in the back thigh as he stretches forward. Didn't pick that slower one. They scamper through and he has half-collapsed. Perhaps that was a little right of the inner thigh"
171,"Bumrah to Warner, no run another slower one. This one spits off a length outside off. Shoulder of the bat and into the off side as he fends in front"
172,"Bumrah to Warner, no run back of a length at off stump, pushes too hard as he looks to steal a single in the off side"

176,"Hardik to Smith, no run back of a length in the corridor, pushed to point off the back foot"
177,"Hardik to Smith, 1 run back of a length outside off, turned to deep square off the back foot"
178,"Hardik to Warner, 3 runs in the air but he's safe. It's a slower ball, climbing on him from a length at off stump. He goes across the line but has to check his shot. Manages to chip it over midwicket"
179,"Hardik to Smith, no run strikes him on the pads and he's on the back foot trying to shovel this into the leg side. Loud appeal. It hit him on the knee roll. No problem on height for sure. Deep in the crease. They've reviewed. Well, I'd make a terrible umpire. It hit him in line, but that was probably going over. Umpire's call. He survives"
180,"Hardik to Smith, OUT out the next ball! If you think Bumrah's bowling action is queer, you should see this catch! This is a length ball, on middle stump. Straightens and climbs as he looks to flick this into the leg side. It's a top edge that flies over Bumrah at short fine leg. He runs backwards in pursuit...only to realise he has overdone it. By the time it comes down, he's facing the crowd. Extraordinarily, he arches backwards, puts up a reverse-cup and follows this swerving ba"
181,"Kuldeep to Head, no run good length, spins back in at off stump. Stretches forward and pokes it back. Extra cover dives to his left to field"

187,"Hardik to Head, 1 run slower ball, full at middle stump. Driven to sweeper with an open face"
188,"Hardik to Warner, 2 runs back of a length into the pads. An offcutter. Whipped uppishly to deep square's left"
189,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run slower ball, short at middle stump. Looks to parry it past short fine but he's got a leading edge that lands in front of Kuldeep. He's too keen on the run out and is shaping to throw before gathering it. Fumbles and lets them through"
190,"Hardik to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length at off stump. MAxwell already skipping leg side to make room. Slashes this hard, straight to sweeper cover"
191,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run another offcutter, good length and on the pads. Flicked past short fine's dive. Deep backward square keeps it to one"
192,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs back of a length at leg stump, pushed through square leg off the back foot"
193,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs incredible shot. This is full, almost an overpitched one at middle. But he middles the sweep after getting right down. Gets it past square leg. Deep midwicket runs 20 yards to his left and slides to save the boundary"
194,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run full at middle stump, jammed out to midwicket"
195,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run wrong'un, good length at off stump. Deflected off the inside half of the bat as he pushes forward at this"
196,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run didn't pick it. On the back foot to this length ball at off stump. Spins away as he pokes at it"
197,"Hardik to Maxwell, no run 144 kph. That was quick from Pandya. Maxwell was backing away early, so he followed him with a bouncer. Too quick to even attempt the shot. A stare from Pandya to cap it all"
198,"Hardik to Maxwell, no run yorker at middle stump. Inside edge, onto pad and straight to mid-on via the bowler's fingertips"
199,"Hardik to Maxwell, 2 runs lands wide of mid-on who was backpedalling. Good length ball, slow and outside off. Looks to slice it over extra cover but it's off the toe and lobbed over the umpire. Pandey can't get to it"
200,"Hardik to Maxwell, FOUR runs well played. Shuffles around, camps in the crease and waits for the shot ball to come to him. Third man is in and he slices this over him"
201,"Hardik to Maxwell, FOUR runs whack. Some force on that from Maxwell. Old-fashioned slog after setting up deep in his crease. Midwicket was in and he picked this slower ball from outside off and slapped it past him"
202,"Hardik to Maxwell, no run knuckle ball. Dug in short. He backs away to try and slap this behind square on the off side, but the change in pace does him. Beaten"
203,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run short one on the leg stump. Looks to force it off the back foot, awkwardly. It lands pitch side on the off side off the leading edge"
204,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run a stumping referral to the third umpire. This one was outside off at a length. Spun away rapidly as he pushed right forward. His leg is in the air...but in the next frame, as Dhoni flicks the bails off, it has landed. He's safe."
205,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run no idea, Stoinis. Walks across to the off side. Not sure whether to go forward or back. Stuck in between. Awkward poke and he's trapped on the pad. HE was outside the line"
206,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run full and fast at middle stump and he goes for the sweep. Just manages to get bat. Just. Turned to short fine"
207,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run length at middle stump, forward block"
208,"Chahal to Stoinis, 2 runs tossed up outside off, driven past extra cover and wide of long-off. Back for the second"
209,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run good length, outside off stump. Switches to a left-handed grip and tries to waft this over backward point. Cops it in the body."
210,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, FOUR runs short and spinning down leg. Pin drop silence as the crowd see Maxwell swivel and launch this over short fine. One bounce, into the long leg boundary"
211,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs good length at middle stump, not to the pitch with the slog sweep but he goes through. Gets under it, and lifts it over the midwicket boundary"
212,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs oh, so clean! What a striker of the ball. This is in his slot. Nicely looped full at middle stump. A short stride to get to the pitch and clobbered flat into the sightscreen"
213,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs uff! This is what they pay him for. Full one on leg stump. Slightly flat but he's down quickly. On one knee. Lifts it cleanly over the square leg boundary"

215,"Chahal to Stoinis, 1 run makes room early. This is full on middle stump. He slices it to sweeper cover"
216,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run full on leg stump. He goes for the sweep and it flies to square leg. Appears to be a bump ball. And the soft signal is not out as he goes upstairs...not out."
217,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run full outside off, down the track to drive through the off side. Mistimes it. Straight back at the bowler"
218,"Chahal to Maxwell, no run full outside off, misses the reverse sweep. An emphatic, wild reverse sweep attempt"
219,"Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs ohhhhh yesss. Pushed through at leg stump. Down on one knee again. It's so close to him but he gets under and launches it over square leg"
220,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run tossed up at off stump. Wrong'un. He's beaten and Dhoni has missed the ball and the stumping. Stoinis was outside"

222,"Kuldeep to Wade, 1 run full toss at leg stump, tickled straight to short fine"
223,"Kuldeep to Faulkner, 1 run full at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
224,"Kuldeep to Wade, no run wrong'un, strikes him in front of off. He didn't pick that on the front foot. Not out says the umpire. May have been going over. There was also the sound of an inside edge"
225,"Chahal to Faulkner, 1 run Chahal lobs up a middle-stump full-toss, Faulkner flicks the ball out to deep midwicket"
226,"Chahal to Wade, no run Chahal has dropped a return catch! It wasn't an easy chance. Wade forays down the track, takes it on the full and drives it back to the bowler. Chahal sticks out his right hand but the ball does not stick. Not even on the rebound"
227,"Chahal to Wade, FOUR runs tossed outside off, Wade runs down the track again, slugs it away to the left of Pandya at deep midwicket"
228,"Chahal to Wade, no run pushed through flatter and faster, starts outside leg and spins in to beat the sweep and rap the front pad. The lbw appeal is shot down"

235,"Hardik to Wade, 1 wide full cutter, floats down the leg side as Wade falls over a paddle sweep. Leg-side wide"
236,"Hardik to Wade, no run Wade is hit on the grille of the helmet. Slower, short ball on leg stump, Wade is through with the hook. Ricochets into the helmet off the arm. India have been excellent with their cutters and slower balls"
237,"Hardik to Wade, no run hip-high short ball outside off, which is shovel-pulled away to square leg"
238,"Chahal to Faulkner, no run really full and wide outside off, the batsman backs away outside leg and flat-bats it back to the bowler"
239,"Chahal to Faulkner, 1 run Chahal drops another catch off his own bowling. Tossed outside off, grips, and turns away. The batsman eyes up a swipe across the line, against the turn. The ball balloons to the left of Chahal. He runs to his left, gets both his hands onto the ball, but can't cling on to this edge"
240,"Chahal to Cummins, no run length-ball googly, breaks back in and bounces over off, Cummins aims to hit down the ground. No dice"

246,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run really, really full on the leg stump, Faulkner squirts an inside edge to square leg"
247,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, FOUR runs shortish and outside off, powerfully heaved across the line to the right of deep midwicket. Cummins can smack it alright but is this beyond Australia"
248,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 1 run backs away outside leg, meets a short ball and crisply forces it to the sweeper"

256,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run Bumrah searches for the yorker, misses his length and offers up a full-toss on off, which is belted ram-rod straight down the ground, so much so it strikes the stumps at the non-striker's end"

258,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run full-toss on off, punched down to long-on. The call from Faulker is for two but Australia have to settle with just one"

260,"Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, no run another one, slower, fuller, wider outside off. Coulter-Nile does not spot the lack of pace. He slogs way too early"
261,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run middle-stump yorker, dragged to long-on off the toe end"
262,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide wide of the crease and floated very wide outside off, well past the guideline, off-side wide"

267,"Bumrah to Faulkner, no run very full and the exaggerated angle makes things difficult for Faulkner. Flicked away through midwicket. Faulkner farms the strike"
268,"Bumrah to Faulkner, no run Faulkner extends his hands, slashes, and edges it behind. The ball dips on Dhoni who dives forward and gloves the ball. But he isn't sure if it's a clean catch. He has a wry smile. The soft signal from umpire Erasmus is out. They go to the TV umpire. Nope, Dhoni has grassed it"
269,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 wide slower short ball outside off, past the wild swing, off-side wide"
270,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run really, really full on off, not a perfect yorker, squeezed down to long-on. There is a mix-up between the wickets. The throw from the deep, though, hits Faulkner on his back side"

Bumrah sent Cartwright's off stump cartwheeling in his second over, then took an excellent catch to dismiss Smith.
