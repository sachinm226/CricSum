3,"Positive signs for England would you say with these team changes for Australia? Obviously the injury to Cummins can't be helped but the change of Smith for Forrest is obviously designed to bolster their batting, fearful of England's powerful bowling line-up?"

Indeed disappointing John, hopefully he's a young man who will get stronger an"

280,"Swann to Bailey, 2 runs full and juicy, Bailey goes big ... it's not got the legs to clear the rope but returns to earth between Bresnan at deep midwicket and Morgan at long-on. Bresnan perhaps hesitated and couldn't quite get his hands to the catch, despite throwing himself full length"

292,"Dernbach to Lee, 3 runs slower ball, out of the back of the hand, Lee shovels the ball skyward again, it's coming down between long-on and long-off ... Morgan gets there but can't cling on as his body hits the turf, the ball popping free and allowing Lee to pick up three"
293,"2.55pm: So, Australia manage to hoist themselves above 250 thanks to a handy cameo from Lee, who might've have been caught on 3 but swung his bat with gusto. That looks some 20-30 runs short, on a decent wicket - though I think the average score batting first at The Oval is something like 255, so it might"
