0,"1610hrs Once again the game seems to have slipped away from Pakistan in the last 10 overs. From 6 for 190 in 40, Australia have scored 8 for 277. A crazy little cameo from Hauritz - 53 off 39 balls, and a typical one-day knock from Hussey have led the recovery for Australia. Join us in half an hour to see how Pakistan do with the chase"

Four short deliveries, tucking him up, getting a short leg in, keeping him in the crease, and then sucker punch, full and wide, and the edge flies to right of Haddin who dives and takes it single-handed. No. 5 for Haddin too. I think Waqar Younis holds the record for most back-to-back five-fors in ODIs,"
