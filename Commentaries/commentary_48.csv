115,"Natarajan to Henriques, OUT Henriques reviews a catch behind. Given very late by the umpire, presumably because India were celebrating before they appealed. It's a cutter in the corridor. He was looking to slap that over the leg side. There's nothing on the thermal images, but Snicko has a murmur as the ball is adjacent to the bat. The decision will be upheld"

122,"Chahar to Sams, 3 runs full slower ball outside off, clears the front leg and drills it firmly to long-off's left. Pandya with the sprint again and can't collect cleanly"

124,"Chahar to Stoinis, 3 runs lands between short fine and deep square who are converging. Miscued pick-up shot at this length ball on the pads goes high but lands safely - for Stoins, that is. The fielders were briefly in danger of a collision"
125,"8:48pm So Australia manage to get just over a 100 in the second half of their innings, which is a decent effort given how India pulled things back in the middle overs. The clean hitting Wade showed at the start wasn't quite replicable outside of the powerplay, which is usually a sign of a sluggish pitch. Certainly there's purchase for those who bowl cutters. Australia have a decent line-up for such a strategy. Back"
