182,"Harbhajan to Pattinson, 1 run stays low as Pattinson goes back to defend, but he does well to keep it out"
183,"Harbhajan to Siddle, no run lovely delivery. Slower through the air, the doosra, beats the outside edge big time, but it's the bounce that saves Siddle. Bhaj's first doosra in the match?"
184,"Harbhajan to Siddle, no run defended off the front foot"
185,"Harbhajan to Siddle, OUT Bhajji finally gets a wicket in his 100th Test. Finally Sehwag takes a catch. He has worked Siddle out well.

195,"Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run defended off the front foot"
196,"Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run huge lbw appeal. Harbhajan looks disgusted. Harbhajan seems to be asking him why this is not given, and Dharmasena is not saying anything. But I tell you what, lbws don't come plumber than this. Quick delivery, flat, doesn't turn, hits his front pad in front of off, and then the back pad. Perhaps the umpire thought one of the two impacts was off the bat. The pitch mat"
197,"Harbhajan to Pattinson, 1 run driven down the wicket for a single"
198,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run short of a length, punched to pint where Tendulkar fields. Huge cheer as usual whenever the ball goes to him"

206,"Jadeja to Lyon, no run"
207,"Jadeja to Lyon, no run India continue appealing for everything. Sometimes twice off the same ball. Looks to sweep this, and misses. Appeal for lbw is denied because it has hit him outside the line of off. But the ball lobs up to silly point, and they appeal for the catch too. Beats me how you can appeal for both because they contradict each other"

219,"Jadeja to Lyon, no run beaten on the sweep, India appeal on cue, but this has hit him well outside the line. I tell you what, Dharmasena must have made a few mistakes, but India's appealing has been ridiculous, and crying wolf every time doesn't help you when there is no DRS"

227,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run carrom ball, not much turn on it, defended off the back foot"
228,"Jadeja to Lyon, no run defended off the front foot"
229,"Jadeja to Lyon, 1 run quicker, turning away, takes the edge, but it doesn't carry to slip, and they take a single off the ricochet. First run in 32 balls, I think"

266,"Ashwin to Lyon, no run beaten on the sweep, but this has hit him outside the line, but India belt out a similar appeal"

268,"Ashwin to Lyon, OUT finally Dharmasena raises his finger. Don't think he was left with an option. Offbreak, middle and leg, swept away, gets an edge fine, and Kohli takes a superb catch to his right at backward short leg. Ashwin's best figures in first-class cricket"

270,"If you are still here, the world's favourite virtual cricket game is back. Have you updated your Fantasy team yet?"
271,"11.45am That's end of the innings, and also lunch. Australia will be the happier side with this total. The wicket has started to play the tricks, but do Australia have the bowlers suited to capitalising on them? We will find out soon. I, for one, won't rule out Starc, Pattinson and Siddle on any surface. We will be back by around 12.20pm. Play resumes at 12.25pm"
272,Lyon is out of the attack. Siddle comes back. I just hope Pattinson is not injured. He has bowled three overs and has taken two wickets

278,"Siddle to Pujara, 1 run fullish outside off, pushed past cover for one"

280,"Henriques to Pujara, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the front foot"
281,"Henriques to Pujara, 1 run short of a length, outside off, dabbed away wide of the wide slip for a single. And he overtakes Tendulkar"

285,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot"
286,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run lovely slower ball at 122ks. It has done Dhoni in, has drawn a huge appeal for lbw. Dhoni shows the bat immediately, but not sure if there is an edge. Pitched on off, doesn't cut in much, hits him on the thigh of the back leg, but it is bent. Replays show an inside edge, though. Another good call from Dharma"

291,"Starc to Jadeja, 2 leg byes Jadeja continues to live dangerously. Sharp inducker, draws a half shout, but it is a bit high. Jadeja takes two leg-byes fine of third man"
292,"Starc to Jadeja, no run swinging in, Jadeja has no clue about this, gets a thick inside edge as he pushes away from the body"
293,"Starc to Jadeja, no run bouncer, Jadeja avoids it but only just. Nipping back into him too. And he is done in by the quickness of it. It's the ball that has avoided Jadeja more than the other way around"
294,"Starc to Jadeja, no run goes for the fuller swinging delivery, but it is down leg"
295,"Starc to Jadeja, no run swinging in late again, this time Jadeja hits it with the middle of the bat. To mid-on"

326,"Lyon to Tendulkar, 2 runs turning in sharply from outside off, but he is too short again, and Tendulkar guides him fine for a couple"
327,"Lyon to Tendulkar, no run huge appeal. The question here is, did he play a shot? I think he didn't. Flighted outside off, dips on him. Tendulkar is looking to defend, but because if the dip he decides to pad it away. Did it turn back enough? Anyone's guess. The umpire thinks there is too long a distance to go between the pad and the stumps. Or did he actually think he ewas playing a shot? Because he"

342,"Lyon to Harbhajan, no run not paying a shot, on the back foot, the ball is turning in, that has to be a very good shout, but not given. Like with Tendulkar yesterday, this ball dips on Harbhajan, and he aborts the defensive and shoulders arms. The ball turns back, doesn't bounce alarmingly, and hits him not far from off. A long appeal fails to withdraw a response. That's a very very good shout with"

355,"Siddle to Dhoni, FOUR runs what a way to bring up the hundred. Skips down the track, adjusts for the late movement, and lofts this over square leg for four. The roof of the stadium comes off. Coolly he accepts the applause. Doesn't even remove his helmet"

388,"Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs Lyon tries to get a hand to it but a good job he hasn't succeeded. That would have ended the series for him. Drilled back at him. All of Dhoni's power coming back at Lyon"

404,"Siddle to Dhoni, no run length ball, on off, defended to cover"
405,"Siddle to Dhoni, 1 run short of a length, pushed wide of point. There are three - at least three - indecisions about this comfortable single.

537,"Siddle to Kohli, no run wide length ball, left alone"
538,"Siddle to Kohli, no run loose shot. Siddle goes wide of the crease, which makes Kohli play at a wide delivery. Short of a length it is, holds its line, and beats the push"

558,"Clarke to Tendulkar, no run that's a spitting cobra, and now Clarke smiles. From outside leg that jumps towards the throat. Tendulkar defends with the bottom hand off even as his head falls back"

573,"Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs down the wick, on the pads, and he whips it fine of deep square for a couple. Good diving effort from Start"

598,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run full, outside off, defended back to him"

623,"Pattinson to Dhoni, 1 run dabs this away for a single, and retains the strike"
624,"Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs Warner misfields. That's strange. Read that again if you don't believe it. Helicopter shot. Drilled same at Warner, but he lets it through at long, and apologises immediately"
625,"Lyon to Dhoni, no run swept away, but can't beat short fine leg"
626,"Lyon to Dhoni, no run swept away wide of deep midwicket, but Dhoni refuses the single. I presume he is shieldin BK from Pattinson, but against Lyon he wants to just him and hence wants the strike"

644,"Pattinson to Dhoni, 2 runs short of a length, into the body, and he has placed this between deep square and deep midwicket for a couple, and keeps the strike"
645,"Pattinson to Dhoni, FOUR runs wheels are coming off. Misfield by Starc now. By Australian fast bowlers' standards, I mean. Indian fast bowlers would have let it through anyway. Pulled away to the left of Starc at deep square, he puts in the dive, gets both hands to it, but he can't keep it in. Dhoni reaches the highest score by an Indian captain against Australia"

647,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run dabbed away to point this time"
648,"Pattinson to Dhoni, 1 run Dhoni has taken that single on a racing bike. I am not sure I have seen somebody take a single quicker than this. Driven straight to mid-off, he wants to retain the strike, and he just sets off. There is dust flying all over as he mauls the pitch with his speed, and beats the throw"
649,"Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs Dhoni keeps on chugging along. He fancies Lyon a lot. Skips down the track, gets too close to it, ends up dragging and lofting it to deep midwicket. Henriques sets under it, but he clears him"
650,"Lyon to Dhoni, no run"
651,"Lyon to Dhoni, no run kicked away"
652,"Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs Dhoni is toying around with Lyon here. This is a serious innings. Down the wicket, close to its pitch, and drills it over long-off with a flat six"

664,"Lyon to Kohli, no run allows him to go back again by pitching short. Kohli defends well"
665,"Lyon to Kohli, FOUR runs lovely shot. Tossed up a little too far. Kohli knows he can reach the pitch of the ball if he stretches. And stretch he does, and drives it against the turn, along the ground, and past cover for four more"
666,"Lyon to Kohli, no run this is better. A little shorter than being a half-volley, and draws a respectful defensive from Kohli"

674,"Lyon to Tendulkar, no run pushed well forward to defend this"
675,"Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run"
676,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run fifty for Kohli. Lyon is too short again, and he goes back to place it past short leg. Positive innings, composed innings"

683,"Warner to Dhoni, no run sharp turn from out of the rough, hits him on the chest, but Dhoni is not bothered"
684,"Warner to Dhoni, 1 run sharp turn and bounce, and Dhoni dabs it away for a single to short third man. Dhoni is doing pretty much as he likes. Farming strikes, taking singles off the last ball, hitting sixes whenever he fancies"

686,"Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs short, wide, dabbed away past point for a couple that takes the lead past 100"

701,"Siddle to Tendulkar, no run presses a long way forward to defend this inswinger"
702,"Siddle to Tendulkar, FOUR runs and Tendulkar immediately shows the bat to the umpire. This is swinging in a bit much, and he has glanced it fine. Seems on first viewing that it comes off the pad, but Tendulkar is quick to let the umpire know that he got a touch to it. Runs called. He clearly hit the ball, but Tendulkar wasn't taking any chances there"
703,"Warner to Dhoni, no run flighted outside leg, defended to short leg, he overbalances, and then dives back into the crease"
704,"Warner to Dhoni, 2 runs leading edge as he looks to work this to leg. Soft impact towards long-on, and he pushes and pushes and comes back for two"

793,"Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run and Tendulkar sweeps immediately, to deep square leg for a single"

800,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run driven on the up, powerfully, but straight to mid-off"
801,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run huge appeal as the ball stays low and even though Dhoni is down the wicket he looks in trouble. This one was going to smash into the middle of middle, but Dhoni seems to have just about - by a hair's breadth - got outside the line"
802,"Pattinson to Dhoni, 4 byes big-time wide down the leg side, and swinging further away, and despite Wade's dive, it has gone for four byes. A bit harsh on him. This should be wides"

817,"Lyon to Tendulkar, OUT oh Lyon, what a beauty. That's a lovely offspinner's dismissal. They dream of these, and when you do this to Tendulkar in a Test in Chennai, oh boy what a feeling. Tossed up outside off, exactly in that rough, Tendulkar drives away from the body, and it spins sharply through the gate. Reminiscent of the way Vaughan got him. This one might even have taken the inside edge"

833,"Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run length, on off, holds its line, defended"
834,"Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 4 byes this is a jaffa. Not sure if it is a Jeff, but it unplayable. On a length, just outside off, BK plays for the turn, but this seems to have hit the edge of the rough, and gone straight on, and kicked for good measure. Four byes"

847,"Pattinson to Dhoni, FOUR runs Dhoni continues the onslaught. Length ball, Dhoni makes a small forward movement, and goes inside-out over mid-off. Flat, and nearly goes for a six"
848,"Pattinson to Dhoni, no run full, middle and leg, defended to short midwicket"
849,"Pattinson to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni is out finally. Pattinson gets five. He has bowled his heart out, and has fittingly ended a superb innings from the opposition captain. Dhoni falls on 224, eight short of the highest score by a wicketkeeper. This is a bouncer, on middle and leg, Dhoni gets inside the line to hook, but ends up gloving it through to Wade.

Especially against the openers. An opportunity for the Indian openers to otherwise, and get this with all wickets in hand. Just imagine this is Ranji, and you are fighting for a bonus point"
