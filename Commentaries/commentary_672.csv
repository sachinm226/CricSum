0,Hodge must be wondering what it takes to score a one-day ton! He was undefeated on 99 against the same side in the CB Series recently and now he falls three short of another well deserved ton. He wouldn't mind that too much though.

30,"All that's left now is a dead rubber at Seddon Park in Hamilton with New Zealand aiming for a clean-sweep and Australia looking to salvage their battered pride. It will be foolish to jump to conclusions on their fortunes in the World Cup. Once their big guns return, make no mistake, they will come back hard and strive to snatch back the No.1 ranking from South Africa."
31,"This is quite a stunning turn of events just before the World Cup. The world champions, riding on a crest not too long ago have drifted off course and the teams they tormented - England and New Zealand - have clawed back and evened the score. It was the self belief of New Zealand which saw them through, courtesy Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Craig McMillan. Not for the first time in the recent past, Australia have been struck by a blizzard, just when they might have thought that"
32,What an amazing win for the home side and with that they have taken the series 2-0 and have also managed to topple Australia from their No.1 spot in the ICC rankings. Have your say
33,New Zealand won by 5 wickets (with 8 balls remaining)
34,"Player of the match is Ross Taylor, NZ"
