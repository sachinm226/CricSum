14,"Stanlake to Roy, 2 runs offers up some width outside off, Roy drives hard and it flies off a thickish outside part of the bat over backward point. Third man, Andrew Tye, gets a boot to it, old-style fielding!"

29,"Stanlake to Roy, no run huge appeal for caught! Given not out and Paine has called the review straightaway. He's convinced. Terrific delivery, short of a length and nipping back at Roy, cuts him in half. Is it inside edge or trouser pocket? Appears to miss the bat"

55,"Agar to Bairstow, 1 run worked through the leg side"
56,"Tye to Bairstow, no run"
57,"Tye to Bairstow, 2 runs dropped! By Stoinis running back from mid-off. Would have been an excellent catch, over his shoulder, running back and he does all the hard work to get there but then can't grab it. Bairstow trying to launch down the ground"

201,"Tye to Hales, no run plays over the top of a yorker outside off stump...a few decent deliveries in the last couple of overs"
202,"Jhye Richardson to Morgan, 1 run a yorker at off stump, dug out into the off side"
