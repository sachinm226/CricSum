0,"Maxwell to Gambhir, 2 runs half-volley, driven nicely past cover, the batsmen think they have got four runs, but the ball slows up, and they jog through for two. Pathan wasn't even running to begin with. Will India regret this missed run in a last-ball finish?"
1,"Maxwell to Gambhir, no run short of a length, cut away, but can't beat point"
2,"Maxwell to Gambhir, no run this one is darted in, hits the inside edge on the way to the pad"
3,"Maxwell to Gambhir, FOUR runs too full and high again, and he has square-driven this between cover and cover-point. There's no stopping this one, though"
4,"Maxwell to Gambhir, 1 run full, on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket"
5,"Maxwell to Pathan, 1 leg bye full, on the pads, turns a little, beats a half-sweep, concedes a leg-bye"
6,"Starc to Pathan, 1 run length ball, angling in, pushed into the leg side for one"
7,"Starc to Gambhir, 1 run length ball again, on the pads, worked away"
8,"Starc to Pathan, no run length ball, angling in towards top of off, punched to mid-off"
9,"Starc to Pathan, 1 leg bye short, skiddy, beats him for pace on the pull, but Pathan gets a leg-bye"
10,"Starc to Gambhir, FOUR runs short, wide enough, and he has steered this past point. Just guided past the man. Lovely timing"
11,"Starc to Gambhir, no run another short and wide delivery, but this time it bounces a little extra and he finds the man at point"
12,"Cummins to Pathan, 1 run length ball, outside off, push-driven wide of mid-off"
13,"Cummins to Gambhir, FOUR runs and he angles it in too far with the fine leg up in the circle. Deftly glanced away by Gambhir. Minimum effort, four runs for the taking"

15,"Cummins to Gambhir, no run short of a length, punched away nicely, but can't beat point"
16,"Cummins to Gambhir, 1 run dug it in, Gambhir backed away to steer it past point from outside leg"
17,"Cummins to Pathan, OUT great footwork from Cummins. Short of a length, gets a little big on him, he drops it just off the pitch and runs. On most occasions these result in singles, but Cummins has other ideas here. he strides towards the ball, and kicks it towards the stump, dislodging the bails a second before Gambhir's bat has slid in."
18,"Starc to Pathan, 1 run pitched up, middle and leg, flicked away to deep square leg"
19,"Starc to Kohli, FOUR runs and he really can't do anything wrong. A decent delivery, short of a length, outside off, and he has punched it to the right of third man for four"
20,"Starc to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for one"
21,"Starc to Pathan, 1 run pulled away off the front foot, gets a single to deep square leg"
22,"Starc to Kohli, no run pulled away, wide of mid-on, but Hogg makes a diving save. Australia on with their fielding game"
23,"Starc to Kohli, 1 run full, on the pads, flicked away, Hogg makes another diving save, but can't prevent the single"
24,"Watson to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, middle and leg, worked away for one"
25,"Watson to Pathan, SIX runs allrounder to allrounder, Watson will not be pleased. Length ball, outside off, and Pathan has lofted him right over his head. An evidence of the batting talent"
26,"Watson to Pathan, no run drops this into the leg side, finds short midwicket"
27,"Watson to Pathan, 1 run full, on the pads, flicked away for a single"
28,"Watson to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, into the pads, worked away for an easy single"
29,"Watson to Pathan, FOUR runs top shot from Pathan again. Jumps out of the crease, makes room too, takes a length ball from off and lofts it over point. That's a difficult shot to play"
30,"Christian to Kohli, 1 run dabbed away to third man for one"
31,"Christian to Pathan, 1 run dragged from outside off, gets a single to mid-on"
32,"Christian to Kohli, 1 run push-driven wide of mid-off for one"
33,"Christian to Pathan, 1 run Pathan gives him the charge, he bowls the slower ball, Pathan guides it fine on the leg side, Watson makes a diving save at short fine leg"

35,"Christian to Kohli, no run late-cuts this short ball, but can't get it past point"
36,"Hogg to Pathan, FOUR runs stars off with a big wide down the leg side, but Pathan sees an easy four for himself and guides this between the keeper and short fine leg"
37,"Hogg to Pathan, 1 run gets the length and line better, on a length, middle and leg, turning away, worked into the leg side for one"
38,"Hogg to Kohli, 1 run bowls a long hop, and has been pulled to deep midwicket"
39,"Hogg to Pathan, no run huge shout for lbw short delivery, skids on, pitches leg, but doesn't straighten enough"
40,"Hogg to Pathan, no run another shout, this one doesn't turn, though, and is sliding down leg. Pathan is playing for the turn, but is not quite getting it here, and has twice come close to being given out lbw"
41,"Hogg to Pathan, no run tossed up, this turns after pitching outside leg, beating his sweep. He won't even get a leg-bye here"
42,"Cummins to Kohli, no run that's good pace. Short of a length, 142ks, getting to to bounce towards the chest, hits the top of the bat"
43,"Cummins to Kohli, OUT pace has done him in. This is one of the rare instances in recent times that Kohli has been done in comprehensively by a bowler. It's the pace and bounce again. Short, close to 143ks, his weight didn't go back as he pulled, and ended up skying it towards mid-off. Christian had to run to to his right, and put a slide"
44,"Cummins to Pathan, 2 runs full, on off, goes off the outer half of the bat, a misfield from Warner at point costs them two runs"
45,"Cummins to Pathan, 1 run it's the bouncer again, but Pathan's mis-hit doesn't carry to deep midwicket. Top effort from Starc, though. A bit too quick for Pathan, but it never looks like carrying. Starc charges in, though, puts a full-length dive in, but reaches it on the half-volley"
46,"Cummins to Yuvraj, no run bouncer again, healthy pace too, good over so far. Yuvraj sways out of the line here"
47,"Cummins to Yuvraj, 1 run tucked away off the hip for a single"
48,"Hogg to Raina, FOUR runs misfielded. That's a little embarrassing by Aussie standards. Driven back at him, and through Hogg's legs. Straight through them. Warner puts in a desperate dive at long-off, but can't keep it in"
49,"Hogg to Raina, 1 run Raina reads this googly off the pitch, guides it into the leg side for one"
50,"Hogg to Dhoni, no run Dhoni plays a the cut, in front of square, can't beat extra cover"
51,"Hogg to Dhoni, 5 wide that's a bad delivery. Length ball, on leg, turning sharply in, for five wides"
52,"Hogg to Dhoni, no run no clue about that googly. Pitched on leg again, he plays for the turn, and is beaten comprehensively by the away turn"
53,"Hogg to Dhoni, no run no clue about the googly again, and even though is short, all he manages is an edge to point"
54,"Hogg to Dhoni, no run and he ends it with another unread googly, which squares Dhoni up in defence. Good comeback from those five wides"
55,"Cummins to Raina, 1 run short of a length, steered away to third man for one"
56,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run length ball, headed towards top of off, pushed to cover"
57,"Cummins to Dhoni, 2 runs slower bouncer, Dhoni waits and waits, and pulls it well for two. Well doe to Hogg, too, who charges to his right from fine leg, puts in a dive, keeps the ball in play"
58,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run cramped up for room, punched straight to straight extra cover"
59,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run another dot. Short of a length, quick, on off, no room, pushed back to him"
60,"Cummins to Dhoni, OUT pressure of dot balls there. This is a wide half-volley, might even have been called wide had he not driven at it. No feet means he is reaching out, and manages just a limp hit straight to extra cover"
61,"Hogg to Yuvraj, no run googly, too short, though, punched away, but in the air, and it falls just short of short extra cover"
62,"Hogg to Yuvraj, no run full now, driven to short extra cover again"
63,"Hogg to Yuvraj, FOUR runs looked like a googly, but it didn't even land. The leg-side full toss has been smashed wide of long-on where Christian tried to do too much with it. He dived and also tried to lob it up for a relay throw, but failed to collect it first"
64,"Hogg to Yuvraj, no run accurate length ball, no turn, defended back to him"
65,"Hogg to Yuvraj, 1 run short of a length, quicker delivery, goes deep into the crease to get a single to long-on"
66,"Hogg to Pathan, 1 run flighted generously, almost a yorker, dug out for a single to the right of short extra cover"
67,"Maxwell to Pathan, 1 run driven to long-on for one"
68,"Maxwell to Yuvraj, 1 run worked away off the pads"
69,"Maxwell to Pathan, no run looks for a vertical-bat pull, is beaten by the pace off the pitch"
70,"Maxwell to Pathan, 1 run Pathan charges at him, mis-hits, which is just as well because it doesn't carry to long-on"
71,"Maxwell to Yuvraj, 1 run driven to long-on for a single"
72,"Maxwell to Pathan, no run appeal for lbw as this short ball skids and stays low, but it is also headed down leg side"
73,"Christian to Raina, FOUR runs poor delivery at death. Length ball, 127ks, on leg, Raina punches it back over his head. Lands inches inside the boundary cushion. High elbow held for cameras"
74,"Christian to Raina, 1 run short and wide now, cut away to deep point"
75,"Christian to Ashwin, no run wide length all, he slashes at it and missed. Lucky to get away with it"
76,"Christian to Ashwin, FOUR runs Christian got away with it last ball, but you can't afford bowling wide length balls at death. Ashwin opens the face, drives it square, between cover-point and point"
77,"Christian to Ashwin, 1 run wide half-volley, driven to long-off"
78,"Christian to Raina, 1 run full, on off, driven to long-off for one"
79,"Starc to Raina, no run bloody good yorker. Is Wasim Akram watching and approving of it? Swinging in, on off, dug out, but back to Starc"
80,"Starc to Raina, 1 run short and wide, gets away with it. Toe-ended to to the left of sweeper-cover, but with Ashwin there is no danger of conceding the second"
81,"Starc to Ashwin, SIX runs never mind the seconds, take this six from Ashwin. He ,may not run, he can hit the ball. Bouncer, at 140ks, and he has pulled this well over midwicket"
82,"Starc to Ashwin, no run gives him the charge, misses as he drives at a short-of-a-length delivery"
83,"Starc to Ashwin, 2 runs Hogg could have caught this. Helped away off the hip, in the air, towards fine leg, Hogg gets around it, but doesn't run in at all. It lands on a half-volley for him"
84,"Starc to Ashwin, no run another charge, swing and miss. This one held its line just outside off"
85,"Watson to Yuvraj, OUT Bouncer is back. Hello. And so is Watson's golden arm. Digs this in, Yuvraj likes the drop in pace from Cummins, and he top-edges it to deep midwicket"
86,"Watson to Pathan, 2 runs another mis-hit from Pathan, and it is safe again. Short from Watson, looks to pull it, gets a bottom edge past the keeper"
87,"Watson to Pathan, no run length ball, on the pads, worked away, but not through the infield"
88,"Watson to Pathan, 1 run pulled away to deep square leg for one"
89,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run length ball, on off, plays with an open face, gets a single between cover and point"
90,"Watson to Pathan, OUT Watson strikes again. India might even be thankful that Pathan is out. Memories of Ravindra Jadeja's promotion all those years ago when he tried his best to hit out but just couldn't. This is full, on the pads, flicked away, straight to short midwicket"
91,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, OUT played all around it. Wide of the crease, slightly low arm, angled in towards top of off, Sharma just misses the line completely, the bat coming down from slips, but looking to play straight. The off stump goes for a walk. Australia on a hat-trick"
92,"Starc to Dhoni, no run length ball outside off, left alone"
93,"Starc to Dhoni, 1 run driven away on the up, and the sweeper-cover does really well with the bad bounce on this patchy outfield"
94,"Starc to Raina, no run length ball, on off, pushed to short cover"
95,"Starc to Raina, 1 run short, outside off, steered away, and third man keeps them down to one with a dive"
96,"Starc to Dhoni, 2 runs Watson is everywhere. Wide length ball, Dhoni throws his hands at it, gets a thick edge past slip, third man is wide, but Watson does really well with a desperate dive to save two runs"
97,"Cummins to Raina, 1 run slower bouncer, Raina pulls it, top edge lands safe"
98,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run walks right across the stumps and misses a plum full toss. Ashwin wants a no-ball for height, but the umpire doesn't oblige"
99,"Cummins to Ashwin, 1 run slower ball, slogged away, along the ground, gets a single"
100,"Cummins to Raina, 2 byes slower short ball, Raina connects thin air with his wild heave, they take a bye, Wade lobs the throw too far, and then Hogg fails to back up well at mid-off, allowing them a second"

102,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run wide and full, Ashwin charges down, and misses by about a foot. No bye this time"
103,"Watson to Raina, FOUR runs slower ball gone wrong, and he has smacked this full toss into the cow corner. Warner puts a dive in, but cant touch it"
104,"Watson to Raina, FOUR runs poor bowling. Fine leg is up, and he is full and on the pads. Raina takes the gifted runs"
105,"Watson to Raina, OUT Raina falls in search for quick runs. Wide length ball, he gets under it, but can't clear long-off. Watson hasn't bowled the best of overs, but with this wicket he has a chance to pull it all back. Decent hand from Raina, though"
106,"Watson to Ashwin, 1 run looks to walks across, Watson bowls a wide full delivery, Ashwin gets a thick edge to third man"
107,"Watson to Harbhajan, 1 run full toss, absolutely smashed, but for a single to long-on"
108,"Watson to Ashwin, 1 run shuffles across again, Watson has enough time to realise that and bowls full and wide, and Ashwin gets just the single to cover"
109,"9.02pm Australia will be pleased with their effort here, but India are not entirely out of it either. They know if they can get a couple of wickets early, their spinners can control the game. An interesting second half is set up. See you in 10 minutes"
110,Ashwin to bowl the first over. Watson on strike. One slip in place
111,"Ashwin to Watson, no run goes a bit away after pitching short of length, pushed to the off side"

116,"Ashwin to Warner, no run another slider, Warner gets an inside edge onto the pad, but all is safe"

127,"Ashwin to Warner, no run angling in again, inside edge onto the pad"
128,"Ashwin to Warner, 3 runs incredible shot. Makes room to this delivery angling, takes it from well outside leg, and punches it between two cover fieldsmen. Chawla's chase allows an easy three"
129,"Ashwin to Watson, no run sweeps, sweeps fine, but straight to short fine"
130,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs another incredible shot. All hands and wrists. Short of a lenght, no room, and he has punched it away past point. All the power coming in through the wrists"
131,"Khan to Warner, no run length ball, on off, shaping away a little, draws respect from Warner"

134,"Khan to Watson, no run short of a length, defended"

143,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs short, wide, gentle pace, and he has punched it between cover and cover-point. An over too many for Zaheer?"
144,"Khan to Warner, no run huge shout, and he looked dead. Length ball, just outside off, skidding on, hits him in front of middle and leg. That was close, but Umpire Kettleborough thought it was headed down, but replays show he was dead. Kohli is not happy, and lets it be known through a popular Indian expletive"
