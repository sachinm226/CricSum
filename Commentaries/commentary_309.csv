0,6.40pm News trickling in that Australia have won the toss and have chosen to bat.
1,"Abbott to White, no run full, swinging from middle to off, defended back down the pitch"
2,"Abbott to White, FOUR runs on the pads and that's easily clipped away to the deep square leg boundary"
3,"Abbott to White, no run fairly full, angling in towards off, and it's punched down to mid-off, who dives to his right to make the stop"
4,"Abbott to White, 1 run dropped! That's a terrible bit of fielding by Imran Tahir at deep backward square leg. IT was short and White simply didn't get hold of that hook. Went at a nice catchable height as he slid forward to take the catch, and he simply couldn't cling on"
5,"Abbott to Finch, no run smashed back down the ground, and that isn't really a half-chance. It was full and he went for the straight punch and Abbott put his hands up to shield himself in his follow-through and got a little fingertip to it"
6,"Abbott to Finch, no run back of a length on off and middle, blocked back to the bowler"
7,"Rabada to White, 3 runs starts with a fullish ball on middle stump and White flicks it away off the front foot between short midwicket and mid-on"
8,"Rabada to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, moves away a touch and beats Finch as he chases at it with no footwork"
9,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR runs short, and this hurried through just outside off. Finch looked to pull and got a bottom-edge on it, went over the off stump and bounced past the diving keeper through to the fine leg boundary"
10,"Rabada to Finch, 2 runs back of a length, angling in. Finch looks to block it down the ground and gets an inside edge that runs away through square leg"
11,"Rabada to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball angled down the leg side and Finch gets a bit of pad on it down to square leg as he misses the flick"
12,"Rabada to White, 2 runs short, and that really climbed on the batsman. He went for the pull and it skidded through and beat both batsman and de Kock, who was looking to collect over his head"
13,"Parnell to Finch, 2 runs looks to pull from outside off, is a little early on it and ends up hitting it between the bowler and mid-on"
14,"Parnell to Finch, FOUR runs another short ball, straighter, and Finch times this one perfectly, placing the pull behind square and it runs away to the famously short square boundary"
15,"Parnell to Finch, 1 run a little fuller, angling away outside off, and Finch has a go at it without moving his feet, and ends up dragging it into the leg side. Was looking to smash that through cover"
16,"Parnell to White, 1 run back of a length angling across and he dabs it away to third man"

24,"Rabada to White, no run slower ball on off stump, punched into the covers"
25,"McLaren to Finch, OUT and he strikes first ball. It's a slower ball outside off, and Finch goes hard at it, looking to drive on the up, and pops a simple catch to short cover"
26,"McLaren to Watson, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off, and he chops it down to third man"
27,"McLaren to White, FOUR runs shortish, at an amiable pace, angling in towards off, and White rocks back very quickly to pull it hard to the deep midwicket boundary"

70,"Rabada to Watson, 1 run length ball on middle stump, and he gets across to clip it away towards fine leg"

77,"McLaren to Watson, 3 runs short and wide and he has to chase that wide outside his off and gets a thickish outside edge towards third man, where Tahir slides to stop it. Did his foot touch the rope as he pushed the ball back into play? They're checking, and it looks like he's just about okay."
78,"McLaren to Faulkner, SIX runs short ball and Faulkner clears his front leg to pull that high towards Behardien at deep square leg. He came in off the rope, and realised that was a mistake. Backtracked a little, jumped, and got a hand to the ball but couldn't hold on, and deflected it onto the rope"

101,"McLaren to Faulkner, FOUR runs it's a low full-toss outside off and Faulkner looks to smear it into the leg side again. This time he gets an inside edge down to the fine leg boundary"

122,"Abbott to Faulkner, 1 run full-toss outside off and he makes room and hits over the off side but can't find a gap, as Behardien runs around from sweeper cover"
123,"Abbott to Cutting, OUT gone. Cutting goes deep in his crease and gets under this blockhole delivery, strikes it cleanly, but the straight boundaries here are long and he holes out to Miller at long-on. It's an easy catch but he makes sure there are no stuff-ups, tossing the ball in the air, stepping out of the boundary and back in to re-take the catch"

125,"8.36pm Excellent death bowling from South Africa, particularly Abbott, to restrict Australia to 144 after a dangerous-looking partnership between Watson and Faulkner. It's not the biggest total, but the ball isn't quite coming on to the bat on this pitch and the outfield is quite massive, so it might not be the most straightforward chase. Australia didn't hit a boundary"
126,"8.55pm Right, then. South Africa need 145, and Hendricks and de Kock will open for them. It's Bollinger with the new ball, from left-arm over."

141,"Bollinger to Rossouw, 2 runs dropped Not a good day for debutants, eh? Reardon runs back from point after Rossouw top-edges a backfoot slash. The ball is coming down from behind him and he doesn't quite judge it right, drops between his hands"
142,"Bollinger to Rossouw, FOUR runs length ball, angling in towards off. He clears his front leg and shovels that over midwicket"
143,"Bollinger to Rossouw, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched into the covers"
144,"Kane Richardson to Rossouw, 1 run on the pads, and he clips it down to deep backward square leg"

156,"Watson to de Kock, no run slanted across fairly full and he drives to the man at cover"

158,"Watson to de Kock, 1 run back of a length on off stump, dabbed away towards short third man"

160,"Watson to Rossouw, no run back of a length outside off, punched to short extra cover"
161,"Watson to Rossouw, SIX runs down the track and that is such a clean strike from Rossouw. The angle across him gives him a bit of room and he simply extends his arms to launch it back over the bowler's head for six"

Australia went too hard at the ball while batting, trying to mow everything over long-on or midwicket, their bowling was a little one-dimensional and quite often all over the place, and their fielding was ragged. South Africa, in comparison, bowled very goo"
