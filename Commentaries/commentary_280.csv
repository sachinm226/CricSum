0,"7.10pm Australia have won the toss and will bat, George Bailey is grinning again, as he does. Australia have made two changes, with Chris Lynn, er, rested and Josh Hazlewood dropping out for Daniel Christian and Ben Cutting. England also make two changes, Jordan replacing James Tredwell and Ben Stokes in for Michael Lumb, with Luke Wri"

12,"Jordan to Finch, no run length ball, nips back a touch and rattles into the pads, might have been some bat involved, height an issue too"
13,"Jordan to Finch, no run Finch backs away and Jordan follows him, sends a length ball zipping through past a swing and a miss - decent first over from Jordan"

22,"Jordan to Finch, 1 run short and at the batsman, pulled flat through midwicket, there's a fielder out there now"

26,"Bresnan to Finch, no run good length on the stumps, blocked watchfully"

34,"Stokes to Finch, 2 runs on leg stump, worked through square leg for a couple more"
35,"Stokes to Finch, no run good pace, around off stump, Finch has a big old ballyhoo and fails to connect"

37,"Stokes to Finch, no run shortens his length wisely, outside off, guides the ball straight to short third man"
38,"Bresnan to White, 1 run length outside off, White attacks but can't replicate Finch's hitting, skewing a thick edge to third man on the bounce"
39,"Bresnan to Finch, SIX runs here goes Finch again - he loves playing against England - carting a slightly fill ball out towards wide long-on, Hales gets round to it but appeared uncertain where the boundary was and compounds his drop but sending it beyond the rope. Tough but takeable"
40,"Bresnan to Finch, no run on the stumps, played respectfully back this time"
41,"Bresnan to Finch, OUT on the attack, doesn't get hold of a pull and plops the ball to mid-on! England have got their aggressor, Bresnan winkles him out with a half-tracker, miscalculation from Finch, who tried to pull from outside off, maybe wasn't quite short enough either and spooned to the fielder"

50,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, outside off, smacked down the ground with a baseball slug but straight to long-on"
51,"Broad to Maxwell, SIX runs boom, six more! Broad goes short and follows Maxwell, who simply roundhouses it on its way over deep backward square"
52,"Broad to Maxwell, OUT swings again but Maxwell has holed out to long-on! The ball was back of a length, Maxwell tried to cross-batter it again, came high off the bat and straight to the man running in from the fence. Another frenzied failure from Maxwell"

54,"Broad to Cutting, 2 runs goes back and runs a couple down to third man"
55,"Broad to Cutting, no run tries to dab the ball to the same part of the ground and it's cut off on the edge of the ring, Lumb the substitute, he has a shy with Cutting stranded but fails to hit!"
56,"Broad to Cutting, SIX runs launches into a length ball and sends it high, high, high and just beyond the boundary at long-on. Told you"

95,"Root to White, 1 run around the wicket, flicked out to deep midwicket for an easy single"
96,"Root to Cutting, OUT down the track, punches firmly back towards the bowler but Root reaches out to his left and clings onto a rifling chance that was struck very well but evidently too straight and Root intervened to perfect effect"
97,"Root to Bailey, no run down the track, goes to flick to leg but gets struck on the thigh pad"
98,"Root to Bailey, FOUR runs another step down the wicket, this time picks it up over the leg side and places it perfectly in between deep midwicket and long-on"

112,"Dernbach to Bailey, 2 runs full and wide, Bailey has to almost dive across for it, gets a thick outside edge to third man, Wright saves with super dive and throws back to Buttler who manages to miss the stumps with a flick of the hands meaning Bailey got back for the second"
113,"What a final over from Bailey and has taken Australia from what was only a par score to a very good total, England would not have been expecting to chase above 190 when they took a flurry of wickets to reduce Australia to 139 for 6 with four overs to go. But Bailey's blinder puts Australia in the box seat for another win and Monty will"
114,"Howdy, back again. That final over may have put a cork in the tour for England. Oh Jade... This will again be a record chase, though it's not above 200, despite George Bailey's best efforts."
115,"Luke Wright is going to face the first ball, he's had a good BBL opening the batting for the Stars. Mitchell Starc has the ball"
116,"Starc to Wright, 1 run over the wicket, on a length and there's a hint of inswing as Wright closes the face, works one past midwicket"

125,"Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run bit of width, Wright swings hard but fails to connect, might have bounced a tad more than expected"
126,"Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run is that a drop? Replays suggest it might have been, Coulter-Nile certainly thinks so, Wade fumbling a low take to his left as Wright got a thin edge down the leg side trying to glance off his hips"

133,"Starc to Wright, OUT drops short, pulled... straight to deep square leg! So Wright gets another single-figure score, despite moving up the order, he was in position to play the shot, went aerial but can't have been looking at the field. Cutting did a two-step to his right and then settled for the take"
134,"Starc to Stokes, 4 leg byes full, attempted yorker, I think, slides down the leg side, flick of pad and it beats Wade's dive"
135,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run slightly short of a length, follows the batsman, who plays it on to his body aiming to leg"
136,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, FOUR runs driven on the up just over extra cover, first boundary for Hales, got enough on it and cleared the infield"
137,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, OUT now Hales has picked out deep square leg, this time on the run! Sweetly timed, a little pick-up swivel pull, but not enough to clear the boundary, there is only one man out there but he made good ground and England lose both openers in similar fashion"

143,"Maxwell to Root, no run flat, on the stumps, turned to midwicket"

148,"Cutting to Root, no run on the stumps, pushed back on the up to mid-on"

156,"Maxwell to Root, 2 byes full on the stumps, conventional slog-sweep attempted this time and the ball misses everything, they run a couple"
157,"Maxwell to Root, 1 run pushed across from round the wicket, runs a single to short third man"
158,"Maxwell to Morgan, SIX runs skips forward to a full ball and boings it over wide long-off! Such power in those wrists, the bottom hand coming through as a mere punch soars beyond the boundary for England's first maximum"
159,"Christian to Root, no run on the stumps, dabbed into the off side"
160,"Christian to Root, 1 run gets forward and pushes this through the covers for a single"
161,"Christian to Morgan, SIX runs goes round the wicket, Morgan moves outside the line and plays an audacious scoop over fine leg! Clever batting and that's six more"

164,"Christian to Morgan, 1 run Morgan leaves the crease and clumps one to long-on for another single"

190,"Cutting to Bopara, 1 run Bapara steps back and flicks from off stump to short third man"
