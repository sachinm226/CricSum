0,"Toss: Australia win a tricky toss and bat first on a green wicket. India are playing Kohli, Ashwin and Umesh Yadav, as expected. If you didn't know the Australia XI already, its time to come out from under that rock. People are still streaming in, and it won't be long before MCG is packed."
1,"Khan to Cowan, no run not much pace, but interesting wobble in the air away from Cowan who leans out and leaves."
2,"Khan to Cowan, no run gently moves away from Cowan again, he leaves again."
3,"Khan to Cowan, no run snaps in off the seam at 132 kph, and extra bounce too, Cowan's cut in half as he looks to fend to the leg side."
4,"Khan to Cowan, no run goes wider outside off, Cowan gets the front foot nicely across and has a look before letting it go."
5,"Khan to Cowan, no run too wide now, Zaheer is getting very lively seam away from the left hander, but he's not made Cowan play at all in this over."
6,"Khan to Cowan, no run starts with a maiden, the G roars in anticipation. Length ball on the pads, Cowan quietly works it to mid-on."
7,"Sharma to Warner, 1 leg bye on the pads, Warner can't get it away square. Leg bye for Warner. Aus are away."
8,"Sharma to Cowan, no run back of a length on the stumps, defended from the crease. Bit of bounce for Ishant."
9,"Sharma to Cowan, no run ah ha, daring leave from Cowan as Ishant angles this one across. The ball didn't come back in, though, and skimmed the front pad on its way to MSD."
10,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run welcome to Test cricket, Ed Cowan! Length ball on the pads, tucked to the leg side for one."
11,"Sharma to Warner, FOUR runs edged, safe! Ishant got that to straighten sharply, Warner was initially shaping to cut or steer, but had to quickly cover the line. He wasn't fast enough, the ball hit the inside edge and roared away past off stump and went to fine leg. Dhoni didn't have a chance, and the ca"
12,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run Warner looks edgy. Stays back in the crease and nurdles a ball on the stumps to the leg side. Interesting first over from Ishant."
13,"Khan to Warner, no run beaten by a country mile, and a little more. Zaheer angles it in and zips it away from Warner who stays in the crease and feels for it. His bat wasn't in the same ballpark."
14,"Khan to Warner, no run appeal for caught behind, not given. Zaheer once again pounds it in and gets it to shape away from Warner who falls over as he looks to play it down the ground without much conviction. Definite noise as that went through, the appeal wasn't convincing. HotSpot says all - the bat hi"
15,"Khan to Warner, no run he's attacking the pads again, Warner gets into better position and works towards midwicket."
16,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs cracking from Warner. Give him width and he'll go after it with a vengeance. Full ball just outside off, Warner trots forward and smokes it square. Kohli gives chase, but the ball had too much pace on it."
17,"Khan to Warner, no run shortens the length and beats him immediately. Warner again looks to get forward, but realises the length isn't there and has a fish for it as Zaheer moves it away deliciously."
18,"Khan to Warner, no run beaten again to end the over. Zaheer curls it away from a length, more exaggerated than so far today, and Warner didn't have a chance as he tried to cover the line from the crease."
19,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run on the pads again from Ishant, Cowan nurdles it round the corner for a single."
20,"Sharma to Warner, no run short of a length and on off stump, Warner defends."
21,"Sharma to Warner, 3 runs shot Warner. Length from Ishant, tester on off stump, and Warner is up to the challenge as he plants it past the bowler down the ground. Super solid punch, that."
22,"Sharma to Cowan, no run Cowan gets across and tucks the bat inside the line as Ishant angles across."
23,"Sharma to Cowan, no run full length, there for the drive and Cowan punches it back to Ishant who fields on his follow through."
24,"Sharma to Cowan, no run wasted ball down the leg side, Cowan doesn't bother fiddling with it."
25,"Khan to Warner, 2 runs boy, Warner's bat is all middle when he drives down the ground. This was barely a check-drive to a full length ball outside off. Beats mid-off easy."
26,"Khan to Warner, no run holds the length back and gets the ball to straighten outside off. Warner resists."
27,"Khan to Warner, no run it's amazing how Zaheer gets the ball to dangle in without changing his action. This one comes in sharply and Warner defends well to the leg side."
28,"Khan to Warner, no run that jagged in from wider of off stump. Warner leaves, and in the end a pretty good leave too. But he will be concerned by how close to off stump it got."
29,"Khan to Warner, no run pitched up, and crammed through the line, he can't beat wide mid-off though."
30,"Khan to Warner, no run short of a length and wide of off stump, Warner lets it go - he looks much more settled than he did in the first 10 minutes."
31,"Sharma to Cowan, no run pitched up to Cowan and angling across, this man's living up to his reputation as one of the best leavers in Australia."
32,"Sharma to Cowan, no run another leave outside off, Ishant probes away without getting it to bend back in."
33,"Sharma to Cowan, no run gets closer to off stump, and to the short-of-good-length, Cowan doesn't have a fiddle."
34,"Sharma to Cowan, no run ah, Ishant seams this one in, and it whistles past off stump at pace as Cowan lets go again."
35,"Sharma to Cowan, no run pitched right up, Cowan gets into a very good position for the drive, but doesn't time it too well. Mid-off is in the way."
36,"Sharma to Cowan, no run short of a length on middle and leg, Cowan defends solidly."
37,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs smashed! Brutalised in the air. Zaheer pitches it up outside off, Warner is already a yard outside the crease and lunges forward into position. The biceps then take over, cfracking the ball on the up through covers. Sehwag must have a wry smiling seeing this sort of batting!"
38,"Khan to Warner, no run holds the length back and goes wider, Warner lets it go."
39,"Khan to Warner, 2 runs back of a length, that stopped on Warner, but he adjusted well and dabbed it softly into the covers with a flat bat for a couple."
40,"Khan to Warner, no run on a length around off stump and straightening, Warner meets it with a proud forward press and defends down the pitch."
41,"Khan to Warner, 2 runs short of a length, Warner promptly falls back in the crease and steers through point."
42,"Khan to Warner, no run finishes with a full ball on the stumps, and Warner defends down the track."
43,"Yadav to Cowan, no run whanged down from over the stumps across Cowan, who watches it through to MSD."
44,"Yadav to Cowan, no run another leave from Cowan, Umesh gets this to straighten marginally from short of a length."
45,"Yadav to Cowan, no run angled across, Cowan gets the front foot across and shoulders arms."
46,"Yadav to Cowan, no run good probing stuff this. Holds the length back, gets the ball to come back in subtly. Not that Cowan's tempted into playing at it."
47,"Yadav to Cowan, no run fuller and a touch wider, Cowan knows this isn't heading to the stumps and lets it go."
48,"Yadav to Cowan, no run wastes the last ball, over-pitched miles outside off. Cowan doesn't bother about it. The first half hour has gone to Australia after a couple of nervy moments."
49,"Khan to Warner, no run beaten by a Zak jaffa. The ball's on a thread, and yo-yos away from a length. Warner pokes at it and isn't good enough to nick it."
50,"Khan to Warner, no run Warner covers the line this time, stays back in the crease and defends backward of point."
51,"Khan to Warner, no run back of a length, defended from the crease as it angles in."
52,"Khan to Warner, no run fuller length, Warner gets forward and defends solidly to the off side."
53,"Khan to Warner, no run short of a length outside off and seaming away, he lets it go."
54,"Khan to Warner, 1 leg bye bit of extra lift on a length ball that shaped in towards the hips. Warner skips inside the line and fends it off the hips behind square for one legbye."
55,"Yadav to Warner, no run Umesh lands a pacy length ball on leg stump and seams it in. Perfect ball for Ricky Ponting, who isn't out there yet, though. Ends up outside leg as Warner looks to tuck it square, and gets hit on the pad."
56,"Yadav to Warner, 2 runs short of a length, and Warner's muscled wrists comes into play. The ball doesn't come on, and Warner slaps it through midwicket for a couple."
57,"Yadav to Warner, no run back of a length, hits the bat hard this time as Warner stays on the crease and defends."
58,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run Umesh isn't getting much seam movement out of the Kookaburra. Yet. Back of a length outside off, and Warner punches wide of mid-off for a single."
59,"Yadav to Cowan, no run good ball to Cowan, probably more daring to pitch it up to Cowan. It seamed across from middle and leg, and Cowan defended to the off side."
60,"Yadav to Cowan, no run interesting end to the over, Umesh jags this in marginally from short of a length and gets impressive lift. Cowan does what he does best - shoulders arms - and is hit on the thigh."
61,"Khan to Warner, no run Zaheer continues to get the ball to hoop away from a length. Warner isn't bothered with leaving much, though. Jabs it away to the off side from the crease."
62,"Khan to Warner, no run lets this one go, though. Wider of off stump and seaming away."
63,"Khan to Warner, no run angled down the leg side, Warner is inside the line and lets it go."
64,"Khan to Warner, no run back of a length on the pads, nudged to the leg side on the hop. More pace on that than normal, from Zaheer."
65,"Khan to Warner, no run big inward seam but too short and a touch too wide to concern Warner, who swings the bat out of the way and lets it go."
66,"Khan to Warner, no run appeal for lbw but not the most convincing. Zaheer slips one in with the angle and catches Warner on the way, but I reckon he was outside off."
67,"Yadav to Cowan, FOUR runs and Cowan gets the hint. No one surpasses The Phantom. Yadav pitches this up on off stump, and Cowan laces it down the ground. Supreme stroke."
68,"Yadav to Cowan, 1 run shortens the length, Cowan defends to the off side for one."
69,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs that's the sort of carving that would come handy during Thanksgiving! Pitched up in the slot, Warner lunges across and bashes it with a vengeance through the covers. Straight bat? What's that?"
70,"Yadav to Warner, no run shortens the length and cuts out the angle, Warner defends."
71,"Yadav to Warner, SIX runs and the first six of the series! What a statement from Warner, he's carted Umesh Yadav into the midwicket stands. Short ball angling in at pace, Warner is ready in a trice and slams the pull without any intention of keeping it down. Hayden would approve of this sort of opening"
72,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run superb comeback from Yadav. Slips this one much fuller, Warner didn't expect that length and was stuck on the crease. He played all over it and inside edged to the leg side for one."
73,"Sharma to Warner, no run peach of the morning from Ishant. Not a bad loosener. A horror offcutter that lands short of a length around leg and middle and snaps across. Warner is left fumbling in its wake. Squared up, but no edge."
74,"Sharma to Warner, no run back of a length, this one straightens, and Warner dabs to the leg side. He doesn't look good when he defends, does he? But when he isn't...."
75,"Sharma to Warner, no run too wide of off to trouble anyone, except Dhoni who skips across to collect."
76,"Sharma to Warner, no run fuller length on the middle and leg line, Warner gets forward and defends to mid-on."
77,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run on the pads, Warner nudges with hard hands to the leg side for a single."
78,"Sharma to Cowan, no run back of a length and angling in to middle and leg. Makes Cowan defend."
79,"Yadav to Warner, OUT didn't take long coming, that wicket, after the break. Yadav's sent Warner on his way. This was a set-up, and Warner couldn't resist. Square leg went back, suggesting there could be a bumper round the corner. It came immediately, it was quite pacy, it wasn't outside off like the la"
80,"Yadav to Marsh, no run good ball, zips in from round the stumps as Marsh wanders across. That saved him, he was hit on the pad, but outside off."
81,"Yadav to Marsh, no run shortens the length, gets the ball to seam in sharply and Marsh is caught on the crease. Fended uncomfortably to the off side."
82,"Yadav to Marsh, no run offcutter at pace outside off, Marsh negotiates it better this time."
83,"Yadav to Marsh, no run back of a length outside off, Marsh stays on the crease and lets it go."
84,"Yadav to Marsh, no run goes full and gets the ball to bend in to end a very impressive over. Marsh leans well outside the line and lets it go."
85,"Sharma to Cowan, no run short of a length on the stumps, Cowan hangs behind the crease and defends."
86,"Sharma to Cowan, no run angled across Cowan, impressive carry from Ishant, and Cowan lets go."
87,"Sharma to Cowan, no run full and just wide of off stump, even Cowan is cowed into playing at this one, thanks to the change in angle. Defends to the off side."
88,"Sharma to Cowan, no run length ball, hits the deck and holds its line. Normal service for Cowan - he leaves."
89,"Sharma to Cowan, no run zippy from Ishant. Whanged back of a length, and down the leg side. Cowan managed to get inside the line and keep the bat, and his chest, out of the way. Good ball, well handled."
90,"Sharma to Cowan, no run another one, Ishant slants it down the leg side and Cowan stays put inside the line."
91,"Yadav to Marsh, OUT Yadav's got another! Wickets are coming like London buses suddenly. What a soft dismissal, that. Yadav put it up on a really good length. Full and just wide of off stump, no movement, Marsh walks into a feeble drive without bothering to keep it down. Did it come on slower than he th"
92,"Yadav to Ponting, no run too wide of off stump, seams away from a length. Ponting leaves."
93,"Yadav to Ponting, no run good morning Mr. Ponting! And hallelujah to helmet manufacturers! Yadav sends down a super fast bouncer, Ponting goes for the pull.. Some years ago, he might have carted that into the stands, but he wasn't quick enough on this one. It rolls off the forearm and jabs him on the g"
94,"Yadav to Ponting, 2 runs fuller length on the pads, Ponting is away. Skips into line and works it away square for a couple."
95,"Yadav to Ponting, no run play or leave? Ponting doesn't make his mind in time and steers it off the face of the bat as he was dragging it away. The ball rolls to MSD>"
96,"Yadav to Ponting, 1 run stupendous stuff from Umesh. He slips in a quick yorker, and Ponting falls over and tumbles in the crease as he jams down on it. Well played in the end, but the bouncer was clearly on the back of his mind."
97,"Sharma to Ponting, no run and he's through him immediately. Back of a length outside off and seaming in off the straight as Ponting shuffles across and looks to cover the line. No cookie, the ball slips between bat and body, and misses the stumps."
98,"Sharma to Ponting, no run goes a touch fuller, and slightly wide of off stump. Ponting jumps across and defends to the off side."
99,"Sharma to Ponting, 2 runs short ball, didn't take long for Ishant to try that. Ponting takes him on and pulls square for a couple. In position early this time."
100,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run the first misfield of the series. Ishant isn't allowed to work six balls at Ponting as Zaheer fumbles at mid-on. The yorker, Ponting pushes it unconvincingly and gets the single eventually."
101,"Sharma to Cowan, no run full length ball outside off, Cowan leans forward and defends."
102,"Sharma to Cowan, no run well bowled and nicely played. Short of a length outside off, Cowan does a good Alastair Cook impression as he covers the line and pokes it away softly."
103,"Yadav to Ponting, no run Yadav attacks the stumps with open-chested intent and pace. Ponting crunches down on it and defends to mid-on."
104,"Yadav to Ponting, 3 runs full again, Ponting gets it away but he again falls over in eagerness as he looks to flick. Scampers back for three as the ball whistles through square leg."
105,"Yadav to Cowan, no run ah, he sends down a Ponting ball to the left hander. Cowan lets it go wide down the leg side."
106,"Yadav to Cowan, no run sprayed across, too wide of off stump this time. Cowan lets go."
107,"Yadav to Cowan, no run whoa, Umesh is cranking it up! Cowan cops one on the elbow now. Short ball, angling in menacingly and Cowan gets into no position after pressing his front foot too far across. He looks away as leather thuds into his right elbow."
108,"Yadav to Cowan, no run super shot, and stupendous fielding. Kohli does considerably improve the average fielding ability of this side. Over-pitched outside off and drilled through the line. Kohli flies away at mid-off to stop a sure four."
109,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run full length to Ponting, he isn't yet getting well forward. Covers the line and defends to the off side for a single."
110,"Sharma to Cowan, no run dream ball. Did everything but get the wicket. Zipped in from wide of the stumps and then went away madly. Cowan got forward and across, and played at it, but couldn't get bat on it."
111,"Sharma to Cowan, FOUR runs top shot. Cowan's best of the morning. Ishant goes a yard fuller than the previous ball, Cowan leans across towards the line, drives through the line, bends the back knee and proffers high elbow as the ball flashes across the greens in the covers. Glorious."
112,"Sharma to Cowan, no run Ishant hangs it back outside off, Cowan stays put and lets it go."
113,"Sharma to Cowan, no run lovely ball. Ishant's working the angles beautifully here. Drags this down back of a length, a subtle offcutter that snaps away - Cowan tries to cover the line, but no cigar."
114,"Sharma to Cowan, no run easy leave this time, angles in with the angle wide of off stump and Cowan lets go."
115,"Khan to Ponting, no run slow back of a length ball, on middle and leg, Ponting defends from the crease."
116,"Khan to Ponting, no run pitched up on off stump, Ponting is drawn forward and defends off the front foot."
117,"Khan to Ponting, FOUR runs that's the third time Ponting has fallen down today. Won't mind doing it a few more times, after playing such lovely strokes. Too short, too slow and too inviting from Zak. Ponting pulps the pull behind square, slips on the pivot and tumbles. The ball is through to the bounda"
118,"Khan to Ponting, no run cuts the angle and bends this in towards Ponting, who covers the line and defends."
119,"Khan to Ponting, no run that's better, full length on middle and off, and straightening down the line. Ponting defends even as he adjusts to cover the line."
120,"Khan to Ponting, no run the trademark Ponting lunge across outside off, to defend a length ball to the off side."
121,"Sharma to Cowan, no run full and searching on off and middle, Cowan gets the front foot across and defends to the leg side."
122,"Sharma to Cowan, no run good stuff this. Cowan's leaving balls barely inches away from off, and he's doing it with conviction. Ishant keeps slanting them in from outside off, on a length."
123,"Sharma to Cowan, no run short ball on the ribs, Cowan hops and nudges to the leg side."
124,"Sharma to Cowan, no run fuller length, draws a watchful Cowan forward and he defends with the bat making an impressive acute angle with the turf as he meets the ball."
125,"Sharma to Cowan, no run gets the away seam going now, and picks up the edge. Cowan knew he was tricked into it, but adjusted well to soften the grip and guide it down to gully. Sehwag at gully tumbles and stops."
126,"Sharma to Cowan, no run another smart leave. Cowan stays on the crease and yanks the bat out of the line after seeing that Ishant's length ball isn't jagging back in."
127,"Khan to Ponting, no run awry from Zaheer, angles this very wide down the leg side and Ponting doesn't have to bother about it."
128,"Khan to Ponting, no run better line and on a good length. Ponting is drawn forward into defending to mid-off."
129,"Khan to Ponting, 1 run he may be old, but few man go between the wickets faster than Ponting. Length ball outside off, pushed to cover with soft hands and he sprints away for one."
130,"Khan to Cowan, no run Zaheer's struggling a bit with the lines here. Slanted well down the left-hander's leg stump now."
131,"Khan to Cowan, no run short of a length outside off, Cowan leans out and lets it go."
132,"Khan to Cowan, 1 run Cowan's first false shot of the morning? A probing full length ball gets him to close the face too soon on the front foot and he gets a leading edge towards covers."
133,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run lots of drift on that, in ended on leg stump and was worked to the leg side."
134,"Ashwin to Cowan, 1 run short ball outside leg, Cowan nudges behind square for a single."
135,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run tossed up and spinning in a touch, Ponting leans out to smother."
136,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run spin already, and quite a bit of it. And bounce. Ponting chooses to offer no shot as it jumps and turns back in. It hits the elbow and goes harmlessly to the leg side."
137,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run pitched well up, Ponting leans out to drive to mid-off."
138,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run decent first over for Ashwin as he gets a feel of the Kookaburra. Over-pitched on off stump, and dug back to the bowler."
139,"Khan to Cowan, no run back of a length and seaming in, defended from the crease."
140,"Khan to Cowan, no run Zaheer hides the seam as he chugs in, and puts it on a good length. Cowan watches carefully and defends to the off side as it straightens."
141,"Khan to Cowan, 1 run short of a length on off stump, Cowan pushes to the covers and they get another quick single away."
142,"Khan to Ponting, no run back of a length from round the stumps, and Ponting defends from the crease."
143,"Khan to Ponting, no run slower ball, pitches it up on a full length and Ponting defends very carefully."
144,"Khan to Ponting, no run back of a length on the stumps, Ponting goes back and defends from the crease."
145,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run tossed up outside off and spin away from Cowan who leaves."
146,"Ashwin to Cowan, 1 run flatter ball on the stumps, Cowan hangs back and works it square for one."
147,"Ashwin to Ponting, 2 runs too short and wide to Ponting, he lunges back and slaps it square. Kohli palms it away at point, to cut the boundary."
148,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run short of a length and spinning in from outside off. Defended from the crease."
149,"Ashwin to Ponting, FOUR runs poor from Ashwin, is the wet ball slipping? This one is short and spins down the leg side, Ponting guides the pull away to fine leg for four. Easy runs."
150,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run better length, full on off stump and Ponting covers it well to defend to the leg side."
151,"Yadav to Cowan, no run slipped in well wide of Cowan from over the stumps and he lets it go."
152,"Yadav to Cowan, no run back of a length, Cowan hangs back and defends to the off side."
153,"Yadav to Cowan, FOUR runs glorious! Oh, the joys of a flowing cover drive in Boxing Day! Pitch it up to Cowan and he unfurls utter joy upon you. Leans out, gets near the pitch of the ball and laces it into the covers. Even the ball felt gracious to roll away through the covers."
154,"Yadav to Cowan, 1 run Yadav holds it back, Cowan hangs in the crease and dabs to point for one."
155,"Yadav to Ponting, FOUR runs too short, Ponting is rolling along now. He sees it early as it slants down the line and bangs the pull along behind square leg. This is a lazy start from India after the break."
156,"Yadav to Ponting, 3 runs the backfoot punch now! Ponting stands tall in the crease and redirects a short of length ball in front of cover-point. Only the very best of batsmen can play that shot that well. Ponting is one of them."
157,"Khan to Ponting, FOUR runs he's pulling everything! Off the front foot. Vintage Ponting. Sloppy ball from Zak, slow and sitting up. Ponting presses forward, has time to wait and stabilise before cracking it in the air through square leg."
158,"Khan to Ponting, no run fuller length, draws Ponting confidently forward and he defends towards mid-off."
159,"Khan to Ponting, no run back of a length, Ponting is still looking to get forward and defends."
160,"Khan to Ponting, no run that's more like it from Zaheer. Seams this in from a length and traps Ponting on the crease as he tries to cover the line. Negotiated without much conviction."
161,"Khan to Ponting, no run there, he goes fuller now inviting outside off, drawing Ponting into a drive, but he's too early on it and not in the best position. Inside edged to the leg side."
162,"Khan to Ponting, no run angled across at polite, inviting pace. Ponting chooses to leave."
163,"Yadav to Cowan, no run Yadav whangs it in short of a length, Cowan stays steady and defends to the off side."
164,"Yadav to Cowan, no run full and wider of off stump, Cowan sees it through to Dhoni."
165,"Yadav to Cowan, FOUR runs spanked! Cowan can pull too. Yadav bangs it in, Cowan does a good impression of Hussey as he pulled the weight back after getting forward. The ball clatters through square leg. Australia are flying."
166,"Yadav to Cowan, FOUR runs edged, four more! Short and a touch wide of off stump, Cowan plays one of his more ordinary shots - he cranks it up and over gully. He didn't have room to clear the fielder comfortably, but did just enough."
167,"Yadav to Cowan, no run Yadav goes wider outside off, Cowan doesn't get tempted now, and leaves."
168,"Yadav to Cowan, no run tight line, short of a length on middle and leg, forcing Cowan to stay on the crease and defend to the off side."
169,"Khan to Ponting, no run back of a length and across Punter, who stays behind it and defends to the off side."
170,"Khan to Ponting, 1 leg bye hmm, Ponting shuffles right across and nudges a leg stump ball behind square for one. That was heading for the furniture. Australia have a 100."
171,"Khan to Cowan, no run wobbles away from a length outside off stump, and Cowan shoulders arms."
172,"Khan to Cowan, no run fuller length to Cowan now, he leans out and defends to cover."
173,"Khan to Cowan, no run one of those sneaky Zaheer variations. Haven't seen a replay, but it seemed to be a legcutter that straightened from a full length. Cowan dealt with it well as he defended off the front foot to the off side."
174,"Khan to Cowan, 1 run and well run now. Zaheer probes away on a full length, and Cowan turns it to midwicket for a single."
175,"Yadav to Cowan, no run full length from over the stumps, Cowan pushes it down the track off the front foot."
176,"Yadav to Cowan, FOUR runs he's opening up now! And just as well, after doing the hard work before lunch. Short of a length outside off, not much width at all, and Cowan once again manages to impart power on a hack close to the body. Very Hussey-esque and gets him four behind point."
177,"Yadav to Cowan, no run short of a length on the stumps, Cowan squares up well and defends."
178,"Yadav to Cowan, no run pitched up well outside off, Cowan lets it go to the keeper."
179,"Yadav to Cowan, 2 runs that potion is sure helping. Cowan plants another full ball into the covers. For a habitual leaver, he doesn't necessarily get close to the pitch of the ball when he drives, but he knows what lengths to go after."
180,"Yadav to Cowan, no run through him with a quick yorker! Cowan blinks away in befuddlement after missing the line completely. The ball missed his inner edge and his stumps. if only Yadav had got that on line with the stumps ..."
181,"Khan to Ponting, no run pitched well up to Ponting from over the stumps, defended off the front foot."
182,"Khan to Ponting, no run that kept low, much too low for the pull. Did Ponting just misread the length? Wasn't very short and sneaked in under the bat to hit the thigh and head towards the slips."
183,"Khan to Ponting, no run punchy from Ponting, gets forward and middles it off the full face into the covers."
184,"Khan to Ponting, no run angled across wide of off stump, Ponting hops and skips before shouldering arms."
185,"Khan to Ponting, no run similar ball, Ponting gets across and leaves assuredly."
186,"Khan to Ponting, 1 run he's decided to pull everything today. Another one guided well to deep square leg for one."
187,"Yadav to Ponting, no run sheer pace. Full and fast on the stumps and Ponting is late coming down on it. He gets it away to the off side."
188,"Yadav to Ponting, no run full again, draws Ponting forward into a lunging push into the off side."
189,"Yadav to Ponting, 3 runs the moment it is half short, Ponting pounces on it. This wagonwheel will make for interesting reading. Through midwicket now for a triad."
190,"Yadav to Cowan, 1 run good ball, catches Cowan in-between forward and back. He inner edges onto his boot and takes a single."
191,"Yadav to Ponting, no run angled in at pace, Ponting shuffles into line and defends to the leg side."
192,"Yadav to Ponting, FOUR runs whipped in the air but safely away. Ponting's always tended to fall over while playing the flick and this ball was angling in particularly sharply. He played it in the air, to the left of the diving man at midwicket and the ball rocketed along to the fence."
193,"Khan to Cowan, no run full length stuff outside Cowan's off stump, he leans across and leaves."
194,"Khan to Cowan, no run Zaheer wobbles one away from a length, and Cowan lets it go again."
195,"Khan to Cowan, no run three in three outside off, and another leave."
196,"Khan to Cowan, no run back of a length outside off, Cowan holds the bat away from harm's way."
197,"Khan to Cowan, no run that snapped back in from a length, Cowan shoulders arms as it came in."
198,"Khan to Cowan, 1 run on the middle and leg line to end the over, Cowan tucks it around to square leg for a single. Zaheer's been average after that first spell."
199,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run curls in from round the stumps and straightens to cramp Cowan even as he looks to cut. Dangerous choice of stroke to one that's not spinning much."
200,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run fuller, Cowan leans out and defends off the front foot."
201,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run draws him out of the crease with flight, and beats him in the trajectory. Cowan is forced to drive from away from the body towards mid-off."
202,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run stays back in the crease and defends watchfully as Ashwin gets some rip."
203,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run another forcing cut to a short ball on middle and off. Ashwin sends it down without much tweak, and Cowan can't resist that shot."
204,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run tossed up dolly outside off to end the over, Cowan lets it go as it spins big, but it was too far outside off. Interesting, very interesting over from Ashwin."
205,"Khan to Ponting, 2 runs Zaheer slants one across to Ponting, who leans into it like a well-oiled machine and slides it off the face through point."
206,"Khan to Ponting, no run too wide of off stump to start off, Ponting isn't bothered."
207,"Khan to Ponting, no run that seamed away from a length, Ponting lets it go."
208,"Khan to Ponting, no run full ball on off stump, Ponting leans forward to defend."
209,"Khan to Ponting, no run Ponting gets nicely across and defends to the leg side of the pitch."
210,"Khan to Ponting, 2 leg byes slow loopy bouncer, too slow for Ponting to time the pull and he gets it away off the pad for freebies."
211,"Ashwin to Cowan, 2 runs Cowan works Ashwin with the angle to the leg side for a couple."
212,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run that spins away from a length and is defended."
213,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run quicker through the air, Cowan isn't quite sure where that went, but keeps it away."
214,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run"
215,"Ashwin to Cowan, 3 runs too short. Inconsistent from Ashwin. Cowan hacks him through point for three."
216,"Ashwin to Ponting, 1 run short again to Ponting now and he pulls it square for a single."
217,"Sharma to Ponting, no run starts with a short and wide ball outside off. Ponting stays out of the way."
218,"Sharma to Ponting, FOUR runs hops and steer! Ponting rises onto the toes to get atop a short ball and waves it away with the assuredness of a symphony conductor. The ball dances away his tunes, through the cover-point area this time."
219,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run that jagged in, Ponting left himself prone after lunging across exaggeratedly, and ended up poking it off the pad to the leg side for one."
220,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run nipped into Cowan's pads, he nudges it square for a single."
221,"Sharma to Ponting, no run good length ball on off stump, Ponting leans out and defends solidly."
222,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run attacks the stumps from wide of the stumps, Ponting tucks it behind square to move to 49. Ominous for the visitors, this! Ponting relishes them when he's in form, and he's getting there slowly."
223,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run floater from Ashwin, Ponting stays behind it and defends."
224,"Ashwin to Ponting, 3 runs fifty for Ponting, doesn't come in the most graceful fashion, but it will do. Tossed up on the stumps, he tries to lever it over midwicket and miscues it to send it squarer than he'd have wanted. But he gets three and gets a standing ovation. Well played!"
225,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run spins away from middle and off, Cowan defends to the off side with the turn."
226,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run fuller ball, Cowan props the front foot forward and defends."
227,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run tossed up on the stumps, Cowan defends."
228,"Ashwin to Cowan, 1 run too short and too wide. A case of Harbahajanitis for Ashwin here - utter inconsistency of lines and lengths. Cowan hacks it in front of square for a single."
229,"Sharma to Cowan, no run pitched up outside off, defended solidly off the front foot."
230,"Sharma to Cowan, no run back of a length outside off, not enough in it to suck Cowan into a false stroke."
231,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run back of a length and angled into the pads, Cowan works it behind square nicely for a single."
232,"Sharma to Ponting, no run hits the pads as he shoulders arms! Big appeal, but surely wasn't doing enough to hit the stumps. Landed well outside off and jagged in, Ponting hopped outside the line and was struck outside off, but that doesn't matter since he wasn't playing a shot. The ball was missing the"
233,"Sharma to Ponting, no run that straightened from a length, Ponting adjusted and defended to the off side from the crease."
234,"Sharma to Ponting, no run fuller to end the over, Australia well on top now. Ponting defends off the front foot."
235,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run Ashwin slips down Cowan's leg side now."
236,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run well bowled, spin away from middle and leg after drawing Cowan forward. Outside edge runs away through point."

239,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run tossed up over the eye line and it dips on Ponting, who defends without a worry."
240,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run that one held its line and bounced extra. One of Ashwin's tricks. Ponting was taken by surprise after shaping to play with the turn."
241,"Sharma to Cowan, no run pitched up to Cowan, who unfurls the high elbow as he cover-drives to cover."
242,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run short and wide outside off, Cowan forces it away through gully for a single to the deep."
243,"Sharma to Ponting, no run pitched up on the stumps, Ponting punches with the angle to a clumsy Zaheer at mid-on, who does enough to stop a single."
244,"Sharma to Ponting, no run short of a length outside off, Ponting stands tall and cracks it square straight to point."
245,"Sharma to Ponting, no run pitched up on the stumps, Ponting drives it back right out of the screws. Ishant does really well to put the right hand out and stop it."
246,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run blocks with ultra-soft hands and this time Zaheer has no chance. A single pinched from under India's noses."
247,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run not much turn, Ashwin zips it straight off and length and Ponting defends."
248,"Ashwin to Ponting, 1 run too much turn now, defended with the angle to square leg for one."
249,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run tossed up deliciously on leg and turning away. Cowan leaves, and it spins past off stump."
250,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run The skidder, it held its line after landing on off and middle, even came back in a touch. Cowan didn't know what it was doing. Inside edged onto the boot."
251,"Ashwin to Cowan, 2 runs two good balls, followed by a release ball. Cowan nurdles through square leg for a couple."
252,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run turn and bounce away from the left hander. Cowan was born knowing where his off stump is."
253,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run full toss on the toes, Ponting flicks to deep square leg. These two have added 100, and how!"
254,"Sharma to Cowan, no run full ball wide of off stump and Cowan leaves,."
255,"Sharma to Cowan, 1 run Cowan's gifted his 50th run on debut! He's played beautifully. Back of a length and a touch of nip away, he dabs it to the vacant off side field and trots across."
256,"Sharma to Ponting, no run edged, short of point. Ponting nearly nailed by a monster legcutter. It landed back of a length and absolutely took off as Ponting pressed forward. It kissed the glove as Ponting pressed forward, jumped on to hit his shoulder and ballooned to point. Gambhir was too far back to"
257,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run on the pads, Ponting tucks it with the angle for a single."
258,"Sharma to Cowan, no run Cowan presses the front foot outside the line of off stump as he defends. He's hit on the pad but outside the line of off."
259,"Ashwin to Ponting, 2 runs Ashwin's radar is firmly in the Off mode. Another offbreak lands on middle and spins away to allow Ponting a sweep for a couple."
260,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run better, gets it outside off and spins it in. Ponting defends."
261,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run the quicker one that doesn't turn. Ponting covers the line and defends."

265,"Yadav to Pattinson, no run short of a length on off stump, Pattinson defends down the track."
266,"Yadav to Pattinson, 1 run well played. Length ball angled across Pattinson, who drops it to point for one. Over to Lyon."
267,"Yadav to Lyon, FOUR runs Spots a carrom-ball in the previous over, and now flicks a full ball with a flourish. Why is he at No. 11 again? Over-pitched and sprayed down the leg side, Lyon wrists it away superbly for four."
268,"Yadav to Lyon, no run full length ball on off stump, Lyon defends confidently off the front foot."
269,"Yadav to Lyon, no run wide of off stump now, holds its line from a length and Lyon lets it go."
270,"Yadav to Lyon, no run good leave. Umesh plugs away just outside off and Lyon drags the bat inside the line."
271,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run tossed up and drifting in, Pattinson defends as it drifts in."
272,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run shorter and big spin away from off stump, Pattinson jabs it away."

274,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run another short ball, Pattinson works it around towards short leg."
275,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run fuller this time, gets Pattinson forward and he defends it back to the bowler."
276,"Ashwin to Pattinson, no run well fielded. Pattinson works that back down the track with strong wrists, but Ashwin dives to stop the single and keep him away from the strike."
277,"Sharma to Ponting, 1 run Ponting does the smart thing by getting to the non-striker's end against his nemesis. Back of a length on the stumps, jabbed to the off side, sprint."
278,"Sharma to Cowan, no run slams the bouncer down too short and slipping down the leg side. Cowan ducks under."
279,"Sharma to Cowan, no run leading edge, safe. Not the first time Cowan's closed the face early. Ishant slants it down the leg side, it was there for the flick, but Cowan was too soon into the shot, and popped the ball towards mid-off."
280,"Sharma to Cowan, no run more like it, skips inside the line and tucks a length ball to the leg side."
281,"Sharma to Cowan, no run shortens the length and gets some seam away from Cowan, who adjusts and guides with an angled face to the off side."
282,"Sharma to Cowan, no run Ishant is in the middle of an intense spell here. Ends the over with a zipper than angles in and bends away as if on a charm. Cowan didn't look like he was going to get bat on it, and Dhoni had to move away quickly to pouch it."
283,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run skimmer from Ashwin that skids along, Ponting defends from the crease."
284,"Ashwin to Ponting, no run tossed up and coming in towards off, Ponting lunges and defends."
285,"Ashwin to Ponting, 1 run too many freebies from Ashwin. Another one on the pads, Ponting works it behind square for one."
286,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run length ball, jumps and spins away from Cowan who leaves."
287,"Ashwin to Cowan, no run tossed further up, draws Cowan forward and he defends to the off side."
288,"Ashwin to Cowan, 1 run pitches outside leg again, Cowan easily works it square for a single."
289,"Khan to Lyon, 1 run slow and full on off stump, Lyon scrambles a single to mid-off to relinquish strike."
290,"Khan to Pattinson, no run squares him up with one that jags away politely. Pattinson ends up fending it off the outer half towards gully."
291,"Khan to Pattinson, 1 run gets the single now, opening the face and dabbing to the off side."
292,"Khan to Lyon, no run this one went the other way, Lyon has a smile after failing to lay bat on it. Zaheer is too good for these two at the moment."
293,"Khan to Lyon, no run top over, this. Ends with one that snips in off a length, Lyon was playing for the straighter one and ended up inner edging onto the pads and past the stumps."
294,"Ashwin to Pattinson, FOUR runs tossed up and swung away! Pattinson is making a good impression here, plonks the front foot across and lashes it over the leg side."
295,"Ashwin to Pattinson, 1 run short from Ashwin now, he's dropped a few of them short in this innings. Pattinson whips it into Gambhir at square leg, but he is ok."
296,"Ashwin to Lyon, no run flight yo Lyon, he presses well forward to defend it."
297,"Ashwin to Lyon, 1 run Lyon pulls out the sweep and gets a single through backward square leg."
298,"Ashwin to Pattinson, 1 run tossed up outside off now, Pattinson drives wide of mid-off for a single."
299,"Ashwin to Lyon, OUT Ashwin's bowled Lyon round the legs and Australia are bowled out. Quite a strange dismissal. It was fired in full on off stump, Lyon got drastically across and looked to sweep. He missed, and Ashwin pegged back off stump. All out for 333, triple Nelson ends the innings."
300,"Harbhajan's best figures ever in Australia were 3-101. It took Ashwin one innings to better that, and he wasn't even at his best. Meanwhile, splendid spell from Zaheer. Umesh and Ishant weren't at their best today, though."
301,"Considering they were 214 for 6 at one stage, Australia will be happy with this score. Considering they were 286 for 6 at one stage, India won't be dissatisfied either. An edgy little period ahead of India before lunch, but don't expect that to affect Sehwag's approach."
302,"Right, Gambhir takes guard and Sehwag trots to the non-striker's end. The former's first Test in this country. The last time the latter was here at the G, he pulverised an audacious 195. This should intrigue. Three slips, short leg and a gully. Over the stumps is Pattinson."
303,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run length ball on off stump, Gambhir, as is his wont, drops to the off side and immediately looks for a single. Not to be had. He is a strange judge of a single."
304,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run pacy bouncer, but far too short. Gambhir ducks into it."
305,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run super tentative from Gambhir. Expecting another short ball, his front foot goes nowhere to a full length ball, and he pokes well away from the body. Inside edge runs to the leg side."
306,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run angled across well wide of off stump, easy leave for Gambhir."
307,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run similar ball angled across, closer to off stump this time - good pace, but not much movement for Pattinson. Another leave."
308,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run another good length ball to end the over, Gambhir defends to the off side and takes three steps for the single before returning to his lair."
309,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 2 runs Sehwag says Hello Australia by scooping his first ball over mid-off. Full ball wide of off stump, seaming away, and not really coming on. Sehwag's feet stay where they are, and his arms swish through the line. He hits the ball low on the bat, and does enough to go over mid-o"
310,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run back of a length, on the hips and nudged behind square in more conventional style."
311,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 run Gambhir gets that sneaky single away now, dabbing a length ball in front of point and scuttling across before Warner can get there."
312,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run beaten outside off by Hilfy's stock away seamer. Comes from in front of the stumps, lands on off and goes away, past Sehwag's loose waft."
313,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run stays on the crease and lets a back of length ball go through to the keeper."
314,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run goes fishing again with an angled face, as Hilfy seams it away off the straight. Sehwag's beaten twice and goes over the top once in his first over. Vintage Sehwag."
315,"Pattinson to Gambhir, 1 run short ball on the hips and played really well. Gambhir hops and fends fine to beat the man crouching at short leg and they get a single."
316,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run Sehwag tries to hit Pattinson into the ocean. Full length ball, quite wide of off stump and Sehwag just heaves from where he stands. Play and a miss!"
317,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run over-pitched on the toes, Sehwag times the on-drive quite well but finds mid-on."
318,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run short of a length, a shot of sanity from Sehwag. He dabs towards cover-point and gets a single."
319,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run Pattinson nips one into Gambhir from back of a length. Gambhir's feet are still not moving and he inner edges onto the pads."
320,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run that held its line as it angled across, Gambhir kept the bat out of the way. India have negotiated the passage to Lunch without breach."
321,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run monster ball! Swung in with the angle and then seamed away crazily, Sehwag knew he wasn't going to cover the line and held the bat inside the line. Good decision."
322,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run he's away after lunch, quietly pushing a length ball on middle to leg to the off side for a single."
323,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run Hilfy straightens one from a length outside Gambhir's off stump. He leaves."
324,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run pitched up well wide of off stump, invites the drive. Gambhir's had this tendency to drive loosely since the West Indies series. He goes for this and misses."
325,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run better, lets the ball go outside off as Hilfy probes away on a length."
326,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run beaten by a subtle offcutter. Lands on off and cuts away past Gambhir's tentative prod. Good start from Hifenhaus after the break."
327,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run length ball on off stump, Sehwag opens the face as he hangs on the crease and defends to the off side."
328,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 2 runs yorker tried on the stumps, very full and fast on middle and leg, but Sehwag jams down on it well and gets it away square."
329,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run beaten outside off. Sehwag goes back and looks to defend to the off side as Pattinson straightens one down the straight. He was playing down the wrong line."
330,"Pattinson to Sehwag, FOUR runs typical Sehwag. Played several of these on-the-up flays the last time he was at the G. Pitched up and going away from well wide of off stump. Sehwag's feet are rooted to where they were and crashes it through the line through the covers."
331,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run in the air, past Hussey at gully. It wasn't an edge. Sehwag intentionally plays the steer in the air, and Hussey flies away to his right to intercept the rocket. He can't hold it though. That's a chance! He is standing much behind the usual gully position. Got both hands to it"
332,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run full length on off stump, Sehwag drives past mid-off for one."
333,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run full length on off stump, Gambhir leans across to the line and defends to the off side."
334,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run poor shot from Gambhir, needlessly chases a wide ball though the slips are packed with fielders. Play and a miss."
335,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run shorter and straighter, Gambhir gets inside the line and tucks it square."
336,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 run straightens towards middle and leg, Gambhir nudges round the corner for a single."
337,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, (no ball) length ball straightens towards the pads, Sehwag works it to the square leg area. No-ball it is."
338,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run goes too straight this time, Sehwag whips behind square and gets a single to the deep."
339,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run zippy! 146 kph on a speedy bumper, Sehwag arches back and sways out of the way as it buzzes through at pace just outside off stump."
340,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run back of a length, Sehwag is on the back foot immediately to defend towards point."
341,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 2 runs whoa, I almost jinxed him there. Full ball on leg stump line, Sehwag looks to work it to the leg side but gets a thick outside edge that lobs up over the midwicket area."
342,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run gets the whip away now, controlled and down to the ground for a single."
343,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run full ball on off stump, Gambhir defends to the off side."
344,"Pattinson to Gambhir, no run pitched up again, Gambhir plays it back down the pitch."
345,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run bouncer, Sehwag quickly ducks under it."
346,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run ooh, inside edge. The feet are nowhere. Is Sehwag still disgruntled? That missed the stumps."
347,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run"
348,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run fuller length and angling away, Gambhir opens the face and steers square."
349,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, OUT heat at one end, the wicket comes at the other. Gambhir once again perishes to an indiscretion outside the off stump. Top bowling from Hilfenhaus, but aided by an average shot too. Short of a length, at least a foot and a half outside off stump to start with. The ball then sea"
350,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run welcomed to the crease by a peach. It was a mirror image of the ball that got Gambhir, but closer to off stump, forcing the batsman to play. Dravid tried to cover the line but it nipped away devilishly to beat the edge."
351,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run well played. Sehwag is beaten by the movement, but softens the grip to ensure it goes down and past the slips. There's a third man in place, so the damage is minimal."
352,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run full pitched on the stumps, near yorker, but Dravid comes down on it and plays to mid-on."
353,"Pattinson to Dravid, FOUR runs vintage Dravid to get off the mark. Pitched up on the toes and he caresses it motoring through midwicket."
354,"Pattinson to Dravid, 1 run on the pads again, this time Dravid's nudge is fielded by short leg, who then under-arms towards the bowler's end. An overthrow results."
355,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run angling in from a length, Sehwag is cramped for room and defends quietly."
356,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run pitched up wide of off stump, Sehwag lets it go to the keeper."
357,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, 1 run back of a length outside off, Dravid dabs to cover and sets off for one."
358,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run bumper from Hilfenhaus, Sehwag ducks almost immediately."
359,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run back of a length on the hips, nudged with the angle to midwicket. Sehwag consciously keeps it down."
360,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run Hilfy again cuts it into Sehwag off the seam, no room for the man to work with. He defends to the leg side from the crease."
361,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run this one holds its line outside off, Sehwag hops in the crease and defends to the off side."
362,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run bumper outside off now, not the fastest, but the packed cordon behind square on the off side prevents Sehwag from thoughts of the upper cut. He lets it go."
363,"Siddle to Dravid, no run brisk start, full length ball at pace outside off. Dravid leans across and shoulders arms."
364,"Siddle to Dravid, no run operates on a good length again, not much seam or swing so far from Siddle. Another leave from Dravid."
365,"Siddle to Dravid, no run pitched further up on off stump, gets Dravid forward and he defends to the covers."
366,"Siddle to Dravid, no run that seamed away a touch. Needs to be closer to off stump to trouble Dravid, though. He lets this go."
367,"Siddle to Dravid, 3 runs Dravid flows into that one. Siddle goes a shade fuller, enough for Dravid to reach across and get right up to the pitch and swirl it through point. Didn't time it very well, but enough to get three."
368,"Siddle to Sehwag, 1 run Sehwag has 8000. Short ball aimed at the ribs - perfect angle to Sehwag - he hops and fends behind square and gets a single to fine leg."
369,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 2 runs good length ball, Sehwag drives down the ground but didn't middle it. The ball didn't seem to come on. Dravid had to get out of the way and hence started late for the first, but they should have still got three. Siddle and Lyon tag it together and both dive to stop the four"
370,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run back of a length on off stump, Sehwag defends to the off side."
371,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 2 runs the outfield is heavy? Full ball straying onto the pads, and Sehwag literally swats it over square leg. The ball slows up on the boundary and he gets two."
372,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run on the pads yet again, Hilfy's away seam movement has subsided a touch. Worked behind square for a single."
373,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run"
374,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run Dravid safely negotiates a length wobbler outside off stump."
375,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run good stuff from Siddle! Thunders down a real quick bouncer - he is generally even quicker than Pattinson - at Sehwag's ribs. Sehwag hops and fends to the leg side. Where is short leg?"
376,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run that got big on him. 143 kph and just short of a length, but that ascended steeply there after. Sehwag was sucked into a steer through the off side, and was beaten by the bounce."
377,"Siddle to Sehwag, FOUR runs and Sehwag's gone after it as soon as he gets the chance, when third man isn't around. Short and much wider than the last over, Sehwag carves it over the slips and the ball lands close to the boundary."
378,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run cuts the angle, that's got to be the idea against Sehwag. Defends from the crease."
379,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run over-pitched at pace on the stumps. Looking for the pad or the stumps, but it meets the middle of Sehwag's bat as he on-drives to mid-on."
380,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run short of a length on off stump, Sehwag stays back and defends."
381,"Lyon to Dravid, no run tossed up outside off, Dravid on-drives with the turn to mid-on."
382,"Lyon to Dravid, no run flighted outside off, Dravid reaches forward and defends."
383,"Lyon to Dravid, no run hint of drift for Lyon, very full so tough to say how much he's spinning it. Dravid smothers."
384,"Lyon to Dravid, no run a polite touch of spin on a length ball well wide of off stump, Dravid lets go."
385,"Lyon to Dravid, no run flighted wide of off stump, Dravid lunges out long to get to the flight and drives to cover."
386,"Lyon to Dravid, no run Dravid once again reaches out to the flight and gets there to drive fluently to mid-off. Lovely intent from Dravid, and a good start from Lyon. Gets a maiden."
387,"Siddle to Sehwag, 2 runs leading edge from Sehwag not for the first time today. This is strange, since he isn't playing across the line. Just seems to be closing the face early a touch. This was on leg stump, and skimmed in the air towards gully."
388,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run pitched up, Sehwag has been playing back mostly but he's ready for the drive the moment it is in his half. Doesn't move the feet one jot, mind you, but cracks the drive straight to mid-off."
389,"Siddle to Sehwag, FOUR runs and the gap this time. It was almost as full, a foot wider of off stump, and Sehwag opened the face as he drove on the up. The ball bursts between cover and mid-off. Sehwag ran the first one away from the pitch to avoid Siddle, but bumped into him - completely unintentionall"
390,"Siddle to Sehwag, FOUR runs classy from Sehwag. Back of a length just outside off, no room for the cut and no length for the drive. Sehwag thinks, no problem, and opens the face to steer it through the cordon for four."
391,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run short ball on the hips, Sehwag works it square carefully."
392,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run stays back on the crease and defends to the off side. Sehwag's batting quite slow today. He's laboured through 50 balls to score 39."
393,"Lyon to Dravid, no run Dravid presses forward and steers a full ball to point. He wants a single, but they decide against it in the end."
394,"Lyon to Dravid, 2 runs tossed up, Dravid flicks it straight through Ponting, who plays Hollow Man at midwicket."
395,"Lyon to Dravid, no run good stuff. Drops it short of full length, and Dravid defends the line. He can't get to the flight this time."
396,"Lyon to Dravid, 1 run this time he does, opening the face as he leans out and drives wide of extra cover for one."
397,"Lyon to Sehwag, 1 run he's not going after him yet. Turning from middle towards leg, Sehwag nurdles a single behind square."
398,"Lyon to Dravid, no run shorter length, Dravid stays back and nudges with the turn behind square."
399,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run quick bouncer angled towards the body, but short enough for Sehwag to duck under."
400,"Siddle to Sehwag, no run back of a length, Sehwag is behind the line and defends with soft hands."
401,"Siddle to Sehwag, 1 run in the air but safe. A couple of strange shots from Sehwag today, but he's mostly restrained himself. Scoops a full ball from middle and leg almost inside out into the cover. The ball pops up perilously but lands safe."
402,"Siddle to Dravid, no run full length on the stumps, Dravid defends super solidly to the off side."
403,"Siddle to Dravid, no run textbook defensive stroke from the man who has the textbook in his back pocket at all times. Leans out to the line and defends with the high elbow."
404,"Siddle to Dravid, no run good ball, that seamed in from short of a length. Dravid chose to leave, the ball hurtled over the stumps at pace."
405,"Lyon to Sehwag, 1 run sharp spin for Lyon, that gripped and burst into Sehwag who'd have expected room. He ended up dabbing to the leg side."
406,"Lyon to Dravid, 2 runs Dravid jumps back to an offbreak turning in and cuts against the turn in front of point. Classy."
407,"Lyon to Dravid, 2 runs turns down the leg side, Dravid gets a faint tickle on it down to fine leg."
408,"Lyon to Dravid, no run turns in gently from wide of off stump, Dravid leans out and shoulders arms."

410,"Lyon to Dravid, no run tossed up on the stumps, defended back down the track."
411,"Siddle to Sehwag, 1 run length ball on off stump, mid on and mid off are standing in an entirely different zip code. Sehwag is happy to push a single to mid-on."
412,"Siddle to Dravid, no run full and just outside off to Dravid, who shoulders arms."
413,"Siddle to Dravid, FOUR runs edged, but controlled. Dravid leans out to cover the line, but the ball seamed away marginally and took the edge. Dravid softened the grip well to let it run down to the ground for a couple past the cordon."
414,"Siddle to Dravid, no run middles the forward press this time. Full ball outside off, played to cover."
415,"Siddle to Dravid, no run short ball, hustles Dravid back but he's up to it. Defended from the crease with soft hands."
416,"Siddle to Dravid, no run back of a length outside off and seaming away, Dravid lets it go."
417,"Lyon to Sehwag, 2 runs Lyon again cuts out room outside off for Sehwag, who works a back of length ball behind square for a couple."
418,"Lyon to Sehwag, 2 runs there he's done just that. Pitched up outside off, Sehwag drives on the up with an inside-out flourish for a couple."
419,"Lyon to Sehwag, FOUR runs fifty to Sehwag. One of his slower ones, it has taken all off 59 balls. Pitched up outside off, Sehwag tees off straight enough to elude the very straight, very deep mid-off. Well played."
420,"Lyon to Sehwag, FOUR runs goes with the turn now. Lyon might as well be tossing up golf balls at him, since Sehwag's teeing off. Beats the deepish mid-on now easily as the ball rolls past the straight boundary."
421,"Lyon to Sehwag, 1 run did that land short? Sehwag skips out to the flight and whiplashes from wide of off stump airily towards mid-on, where his protege, Warner, is lurking. One of the best fielders in the world, mind you. He dived forward and seemed to get his hands under it, but couldn't quite scoop"
422,"Lyon to Dravid, no run sanity at Dravid's end. Defends a full ball immaculately."
423,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run bumper to start off the new spell, Sehwag ducks under it happily."

432,"Lyon to Dravid, no run loopy on the middle and off line, Dravid leans out to smother it towards the mid-on area."
433,"Lyon to Dravid, no run edged but there's no backward square leg. Lovely delivery, drifted in, dipped and turned to take the inside edge as Dravid looked to nudge square. Safe once it eluded short leg."
434,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run back of a length on off stump, Sehwag hangs back and defends to the off side."
435,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run third man is back now, so Sehwag gets only a single. Short and marginally wide of off stump. Sehwag sits beside the line and cracks it over gully."

437,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run short ball angles in at pace and Dravid arches back to sway out of harm's way."

439,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run full length ball wide of off stump, enough to allow Dravid to shoulder arms."
440,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run short of a length on off stump, Sehwag calmly defends from the crease to the off side."
441,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, FOUR runs carved. With all the grace of a butcher. A foot or so outside off at no extra pace, and at a good height. Sehwag's bat swings an arc after the ball passes him, and it disappears past gully."
442,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 2 runs over-compensation. On the pads now, and Sehwag deflects it towards fine-leg for two more."

450,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run length ball too wide outside off to trouble Dravid, who lets it go."
451,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run lovely stuff from Pattinson, and exemplary leaving from Dravid. This one came in as well, late and sharp as Dravid shouldered arms."
452,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run beaten by a peach. What a follow-up to a big indipper! This one darted away off the seam, opened up Dravid who had to play but he escapes without a nick as he tries to cover the line."
453,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run short ball on off stump, Sehwag arches back to manufacture room but can't create enough. Defends it to the off side."
454,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 run short ball on the hips, Sehwag fends it away off the glove for a single."
455,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run back of a length outside off and holding its line. Dravid watches closely and lets it go to the keeper."
456,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run shorter length, extra lift from outside off. Dravid rides it and steers to point."
457,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, 2 runs pitched up and Dravid takes up the challenge to lean forward and drive through the line. Threads the covers for a couple."
458,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run Dravid undone again by away seam. He looked infallible until the last over, but twice in a short span, he's been left befuddled by balls that have left him. Almost a repeat of what Pattinson did, this too hit the seam on a length and darted away past the searching outside e"
459,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run over-pitched on off stump, Sehwag looks to blaze it through the covers but doesn't get the gap."
460,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run appeal for a catch at short leg and it is given not out! Did Sehwag nick that onto his hip? Short ball angling in, he tries to fend it to the leg side, and it pops up off the thigh. Everyone goes up the moment it is held at square leg. No edge. HotSpot says so too, or whatev"
461,"Pattinson to Sehwag, 1 run pitched up outside off, Sehwag drives to cover for one."
462,"Pattinson to Dravid, no run Dravid beaten again and looking a little iffy now. That wasn't close enough to the stumps for him to play it but he still went feeling for it as it nipped away."
463,"Pattinson to Dravid, 1 run angled into the pads, Dravid works it square for one."
464,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run this is impressive from Pattinson, thuds in a short ball at good pace and Sehwag barely controls the defensive dab to the off side."
465,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run Dravid's beaten for the fourth time in 10 minutes. This time the ball misses the inside edge as Hilfy cuts one in. Clearly Dravid was thinking of the many outside edges he escaped, and the ball slid through the bat-pad gap. Missed the stumps, though. Big caught behind appea"
466,"Hilfenhaus to Dravid, no run more organised now, lets a wobbler outside off go through to the keeper."

471,"Pattinson to Sehwag, no run short of a length ball, negotiated safely from the crease."
472,"Pattinson to Sehwag, OUT a very good spell of fast bowling in the last 20 minutes of so has produced a wicket. The trouble was at the other end, with Dravid, but Sehwag is the man who has gone. He's livid with himself. It was on a length and a touch wide of off stump, Sehwag went for the blazing cover"
473,"Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run short of a length outside off and holding its line. Tendulkar leaves."
474,"Pattinson to Tendulkar, 1 run inside edge safe. Full length ball outside off, Sachin isn't forward soon enough as he looks to drive, and the edge bursts through his legs."

480,"Hussey to Tendulkar, no run length ball angled onto the pads, worked cautiously to the leg side."
481,"Hussey to Tendulkar, no run nearly gone! Hussey swings it in sharply from outside off, Tendulkar looked to on-drive and the inside edge hit the pad and looped up perilously before lading just short of silly mid-on. What a moment that!"
482,"Hussey to Tendulkar, 1 run Tendulkar survives until tea. Length ball on the pads, nudged with the angle through square leg for a single."
483,"Siddle to Tendulkar, SIX runs Tendulkar has upper-cut him for six first ball after tea! He did this a lot the last time he was in Aus, especially in the CB series finals. Short and wide outside off, not much width, Sachin stays under it and opens the face upwards to slap it over the slips. And all the"
484,"Siddle to Tendulkar, 3 runs over-pitched on the pads, Sachin whips fluently for three more. Roaring start this."

487,"Siddle to Dravid, no run leans out to a wider ball outside off and defends into the covers."
488,"Siddle to Dravid, no run seams away from a length, not close enough to Dravid to force a shot out of him. He leaves."
489,"Hussey to Tendulkar, no run aha, slips the first ball down the leg side, no doubt looking for a stumping. He accounted for Jesse Ryder in similar style recently. Sachin misses the glance, but doesn't take the back foot out of the crease."

511,"Siddle to Tendulkar, FOUR runs four more in cheeky fashion! Tendulkar sees a short ball, barely outside off, he waits on it to come beside him and then slaps it with an opened face. Was he trying to go over the slips? He went between the slips and gully at catchable height, but it looked like he picked"
512,"Siddle to Tendulkar, FOUR runs oh gorgeous! The people in MCG have got their money's worth for coming in today! Tendulkar plays the best cover drive you'll ever see. Over-pitched outside off, he waltzes forward and creams it on a bent knee, and ends up with a bent elbow. The ball shoots through the cov"

526,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run keeps him on the crease with a back of a length ball, defended from the crease to the off side."
527,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, FOUR runs another masterly cover drive from the master. Not quite as 'perfect' as the previous one, since this wasn't on a driving length.

529,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run stays back again and blocks a length ball to the off side."

615,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, FOUR runs another upper cut. Sachin plays it with the sort of comfort with which people swipe their smart-phones unlocked, or make cups of dip-tea. Non-chalant. Short and climbing, he crouches below and dabs it with the lower end of the bat over the slips."

642,"Warner to Tendulkar, no run tossed up on off stump, defended with the turn to the off side."

667,"Siddle to Dravid, 2 runs over-pitched on the stumps, and Dravid is adept enough to forget past worries and on-drive this wide of mid-on. His running is laboured, and yields a couple."

680,"Siddle to Tendulkar, no run strange defensive from Sachin. Stays back to a short ball, and seemed to want to leave it at the last minute. As he was shouldering arms, it hit the inside edge and ricocheted onto the body."
681,"Siddle to Tendulkar, 1 run outside edge, but Sachin controls it and gets a single behind point. That straightened from a full length as Sachin groped from the crease. It runs through point, but he relaxed the grip so it went straight down."

690,"Siddle to Tendulkar, OUT Siddle's done it! Is this a no-ball? No! Tendulkar's been bowled through the gate, still on 99. Top length that, at blistering pace. Tendulkar got on the front foot, but he wasn't going to reach the length of the ball. That swerved in late, was it reverse? Sachin tried to punch"

714,"Pattinson to Laxman, no run this one's not as full and Laxman is happy to play it out on the off side from the crease, it was the movement that bothered him in England, there is not too much of it here, so the length is even more important"

793,"Hilfenhaus to Dhoni, no run pitched up again, and this time he manages an uncertain inside edge on to pad"
794,"Hilfenhaus to Dhoni, OUT oh well, that was on the cards, Dhoni has a go, and gives gully catching practice, Hilfenhaus shifted the angle to just outside off stump, the length was not as full, Dhoni went after it anyway, not too hard though, and the edge looped slowly straight to gully, Hilfenhaus has h"

820,"Hilfenhaus to Sharma, no run watches the length ball go past a foot outside off"

822,"Pattinson to Ashwin, no run that is mighty close, that struck him in front from a length as he looked to defend, umpire Erasmus is unmoved, the only thing that could have saved him was the angle, nope, ball tracker shows it taking out leg stump, Pattinson cannot believe it, rightly so, that was gone"

837,"Pattinson to Khan, no run excellent take from short leg, but umpire Erasmus is unmoved again, it flew into the fielder's hands off the thigh pad, replays show"
838,"Pattinson to Khan, OUT another one goes! and this after the Australia lower order squeezed out a considerable amount of runs, Zaheer withdraws to the leg side, exposes all three stumps, and has a wild heave, misses predictably, and the off stump is rattled, incredibly poor stuff from India"
839,"Hilfenhaus to Ashwin, 1 run and now there is confusion among the ranks, Ashwin pushes towards point, takes a few steps and stops, Umesh runs half way up the track and stops, and barely makes it across in the end"

845,"Pattinson to Ashwin, no run fine solid push towards mid off from Ashwin off a pitched up delivery"
846,"Pattinson to Ashwin, 1 run takes the single on offer as Clarke incredibly persists with a man at deep point to No 9"

848,"Pattinson to Yadav, 1 run this time he pushes this length ball away towards cover and scrambles across for a single, direct hit would have been close"
849,"Pattinson to Ashwin, FOUR runs neatly done, Ashwin works this one off the pads, with good timing, and Hilfenhaus cannot cut it off with a dive at fine leg"
850,"Pattinson to Ashwin, SIX runs eep, how has that gone for six, Ashwin got well across and swung at this shortish delivery, he was of course looking to go square on the leg side, it instead goes way over Haddin and the slips, and carries all the way! Incredible"

868,"Hilfenhaus to Yadav, no run another over gone, as Umesh crouches across and pushes away a pitched up ball"
869,"Lunch India have lost 8 for 68 to concede a lead of 51. After stumps yesterday, Australia would have been thinking of how to contain India. The visitors have instead crumbled in a heap against some disciplined fast bowling to surrender the advantage completely. And but for Ashwin's contribution, they would ha"
