245,They will need something similar from the skipper tonight to chase this down. India were 22 minutes over in bowling their 50 overs. But they were 37 minutes over in game one and only got fined for being one over down.
246,"Innings break Australia post 389 just days after scoring 374. All of Australia's top five posted half-centuries for just the second time in ODI history and Smith made another magnificent 104 off just 64 balls. Although in a good omen for India, they won the last time Australia did that with Virat Kohli"

313,"Cummins to Iyer, no run back of a length outside off, punched to backward point"

494,"Cummins to Hardik, no run and this one doesn't bounce as much as Hardik thought. Moving across, covers the line well to pull this, but the ball goes under the bat"
495,"Cummins to Hardik, no run fuller and still wide of off. Pandya stays still that time and launches into a booming drive, but only connects with air. This is superb from Cummins to a big-hitter like Pandya who is in form"
496,"Cummins to Hardik, no run length well wide of off stump, moving across again, throws his bat at it to crash through offside but he hasn't nailed a single shot this over. This one takes the under edge and bounces to Carey"

508,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run chipped in the air but not in Finch's reach at point. that seemed to really stick in the pitch, on a length outside off, he was too early into his cut, it ballooned off the upper edge.

512,"Zampa to Rahul, 2 runs dropped by Finch running backwards from point. Went down on his knee to crash this through the offside, gets a top edge that swirls over point. The wind wouldn't have made it easy as Finch running back can't even lay hand on it"
513,"Zampa to Rahul, OUT and he's finally caught. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take. After being nearly caught for two balls in a row, Rahul goes off the third, a routine top edge lobbing up to the fielder. Was swiping across the line again but this was nicely flighted and dipped, got"
