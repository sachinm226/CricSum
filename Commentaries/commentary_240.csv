0,"Starc to Guptill, no run length ball outside off, left alone. A Test-like start to the final of 2015"
1,"Starc to Guptill, 1 run short of a length, on off, he opens the face to guide it to third man for one"
2,"Starc to McCullum, no run perfect first ball. Starc has brought it. Full, just outside off at 149ks, McCullum drives, but is beaten on the inside edge. Misses the off stump by six inches. Great start from Starc"
3,"Starc to McCullum, no run McCullum gives him the charge, Starc stays full, follows him as he backs away. No room, swinging in, beats him"
4,"Starc to McCullum, OUT Timbahhhhhhh. Starc you beauty. What a ripper [in Bill Lawry voice]. What an occasion. What a start. He bowls it full, he swings it in, he lands it between the stumps and the popping crease. McCullum is tentative for once. The bat comes down late. Off stump is set back. Starc goes away on a celebratory run. MCG is on its feet. The game is not over obviously, but Starc... how is that for a start?"
5,"Starc to Williamson, no run more swing, more pace. Some dip on it. Williamson is hit on the pad, but the ball is headed down leg"
6,"Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked around the corner"
7,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run more swing. Another outswinger. Left alone outside off"
8,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run short of a length, outside off, gets chest high. Williamson thinks of playing at it, but leaves it alone late. Nerves there"
9,"Hazlewood to Williamson, 4 leg byes strays onto the pads, Williamson misses out on the flick, but gets four leg-byes for it"
10,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run full, just outside off, slight swing away, defended off the front foot"
11,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, in the tentative channel outside off, left alone"
12,"Starc to Guptill, no run more swing for Starc. That has dipped back in, Guptill seems trapped in front, but Guptill has got an inside edge onto the pad. The lbw shout is big, but they decide not to review it"
13,"Starc to Guptill, no run short of a length. First signs the ball might not come? Guptill looks to work this to leg, but he has to wait for it, and in the end he defends it back"
14,"Starc to Guptill, no run on a length, on off, defended from the crease"
15,"Starc to Guptill, FOUR runs wide half-volley, Guptill plays a classy square-drive. In front of point, all along the ground. First boundary off the bat"
16,"Starc to Guptill, no run bouncer this time, and a pretty sharp one. Pitches middle and off, and angles away. Guptill sways out of its line"
17,"Starc to Guptill, 1 run on the pads this time, and he has helped it around the corner for one"
18,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run wide length ball, holds its line, left alone"
19,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run short of a length, wide, punched away, but can't pierce the gap at point. Smith and Warner nearly collide as both are eager to get to the ball. Warner fields this one"
20,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run slight nip back in from a tight off-stump channel. Defended off the front foot"
21,"Hazlewood to Guptill, SIX runs good sharp bouncer, and he has top-edged it for a six. That points to the pace, all right, but also how much the ropes have pulled in. This is not a full-blooded hook. Guptill is cramped for room with this bouncer so he hardly can swing properly, but the top edge flies over Haddin's head for six #MCGsobig"
22,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run shoulders arms to one outside off"
23,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
24,"Starc to Williamson, no run half-forward to defend this length ball"
25,"Starc to Williamson, no run on a length, slight shape back in, but not too straight. Flicked towards mid-on"
26,"Starc to Williamson, no run tentative from Kool Kane. Short of a length, on off, angling away, he is late into trying to punch this. Beaten"
27,"Starc to Williamson, no run beats the bat again. Starc is on fire here. Short of a length again, on off, Williamson plays at it too, and is beaten by the angle"
28,"Starc to Williamson, no run digs this in short, stays on off with the natural angle. Williamson goes low and sways out of its line"
29,"Starc to Williamson, 1 run Williamson is so lucky here. Follows a wide length ball. Doesn't drive at it powerfully. Just a nothing tentative push. The ball, though, has flown off the thick edge, and over backward point. Third man comes around to field"
30,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run outswinger, on a length, outside off, left alone"
31,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, angling in, beats the inside edge, but is headed down leg"
32,"Hazlewood to Williamson, 1 run on a length, opens the face late on it, gets a thick edge to third man for one"
33,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run short of a length, holds its line a little, defended to leg"
34,"Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 run holds its line just outside off, takes a thick edge for a single to third man"
35,"Hazlewood to Williamson, 2 runs overpitches a little, strays a little, first confident stroke from Williamson as he clips this past square leg for two"
36,"Starc to Guptill, 1 wide bouncer, too short, too high, called a wide"
37,"Starc to Guptill, no run this ball is too good. Almost unplayable. This is shaping to swing in, Guptill is playing for it, just outside off, but the ball pitches and seams away. Beats the edge. Another day he might have edged this"
38,"Starc to Guptill, no run angling away this time, and Guptill doesn't play at it"
39,"Starc to Guptill, no run short of a length, angling away from just outside off. Another leave"
40,"Starc to Guptill, no run full and straight after having pushed it across with the angle. Guptill plays around his pad, but this is full and he makes good connection. A dive at short midwicket saves runs"
41,"Starc to Guptill, no run again short of a length, on off, allowed to angle through to the keeper"
42,"Starc to Guptill, no run bouncer again, this time it is head high, and Guptill ducks under it"
43,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run short of a length, just outside off, holds its line slightly, beats the outside edge as he pushes at it"
44,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, nipping in a little, defended off the back foot"
45,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, angling in, nicely clipped away, but can't beat mid-on"
46,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run that's a sharp short ball. This has come out of nowhere, and has kicked off from just short of a length. Gets shoulder high, nips back a little. Williamson thinks ramp, and pulls out at the last moment as it has got too big on him"
47,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, angling in towards top of off, defended to mid-off"
48,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run short of a length, seaming in, beats the inside edge to hit the pad and end a maiden"
49,"Johnson to Guptill, no run that's a sharp first ball. It is nasty. From the low round-arm release, from just short of a length, it rises towards the chest. Guptill throws his gloves up in defence. Lucky it hasn't lobbed up"
50,"Johnson to Guptill, no run again that awkward short-of-a-length delivery that is rising into the chest. Guptill is off his feet to get on top of the bounce as he fends"
51,"Johnson to Guptill, no run fuller, pitches middle, holds its line, defends off the back foot"
52,"Johnson to Guptill, no run stays back to punch this length ball to mid-off"
53,"Johnson to Guptill, 1 wide wide down the leg side this time. Gets the line a tad wrong. Bowled at 146ks"
54,"Johnson to Guptill, no run on a length, on off, defended off the back foot. This is 148ks"
55,"Johnson to Guptill, no run short of a length, no room, punched to cover"
56,"Hazlewood to Williamson, no run on a length, just outside off, he leans into it and punches this back at Hazlewood who sticks a hand out, which ends up deflecting this into Guptill at the non-striker's end"
57,"Hazlewood to Williamson, FOUR runs mid-off is wide, and he has exploited that gap. This is a length ball outside off, he pushes it on the up, and sort of punches it straight of that man for four"
58,"Hazlewood to Williamson, 2 runs digs this one in short, around chest high, and Williamson gets on top of the bounce, and rolls the wrists on the pull. Left of long leg it goes"
59,"Hazlewood to Williamson, 1 run short of a length, wide, he opens the face on it, gets a single to third man"
60,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run half-volley on off, driven hard down the ground, but straight back at Hazlewood"
61,"Hazlewood to Guptill, no run short of a length, just outside off, good bounce, and Guptill is off his feet as he defends"
62,"Johnson to Williamson, no run sharp bouncer, on middle and leg, at 147ks, Williamson gets inside the line to look to hook, but bails out at the last moment as he realises this has got big on him"
63,"Johnson to Williamson, no run short of a length, at the hip, Williamson manages to keep it down with his defence"
64,"Johnson to Williamson, no run that is beautiful. That's an offcutter at close to 150ks. Un. Play. Able. On a length, pretty quick, on off, he has to play at it. And it cuts away to beat him"
65,"Johnson to Williamson, no run another beauty. Johnson is on today. Just a bit of that offcut again as he pitches on a length at off, and then leaves him to beat the bat"
66,"Johnson to Williamson, 1 run the rare half-volley, pushed away to deep cover this time"
67,"Johnson to Guptill, 1 run on a length, at the pads, worked away for a single to long leg"
68,"Maxwell to Guptill, no run he has bowled short and wide, but so far have New Zealand been pushed back that he has cut this straight to cover point"
69,"Maxwell to Guptill, OUT what a bowling change. And how much has that miss on that half tracker played on Guptill's mind. Stays back to a ball slightly short than good length. He goes back to play for the offbreak and punch it. The ball turns, but not as much as he is expecting it to. Hits the top of off. Big Show on Big Stage. Also Haddin gets in Guptill's face with his applauding gloves to leave a sour note on what has been Australia's afternoon"
70,"Maxwell to Taylor, FOUR runs full toss first ball, great welcome for Taylor, he drives this past cover for four"
71,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run defends a full ball"
72,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run turning into the pads, worked around the corner for one"
73,"Maxwell to Williamson, no run half-volley outside off, lovely drive against the turn, but can't get past the diving man at cover"
74,"Johnson to Taylor, 1 run tucked away off the hip for a single"
75,"Johnson to Williamson, OUT Johnson has looked like getting a wicket nearly every ball, and he has done so now. He has bowled excellently. His pace and aggression so far means any slight misbehaviour off the pitch is going to have a big impact. This is a length ball, around that middle and off channel. Previously balls have cut and fizzed away, this stops a touch. Only a touch, mind you. Williamson is early in defending, and lobs this back to Johnson. He is looking to work this to leg, but this has also angled away towards off, which means he has checked his shot a little"
76,"Johnson to Elliott, 1 run runs this down to third man for one"
77,"Johnson to Taylor, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot"
78,"Johnson to Taylor, 1 run full, fast and wide, Taylor drives sqyares, Warner misfields at point, contains a single"
79,"Johnson to Elliott, no run offcutter outside off, Elliott is drawn into a defensive shot, and is beaten"
80,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run full ball, overpitched, middle and leg, driven down the ground, but can't beat mid-on"
81,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, defended to cover"
82,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to cover"
83,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run full, outside off, defended off the front foot"
84,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, he is forward to defend"
85,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run wide length ball, it holds its line, and Taylor plays at it on the walk. Well away from the body. Beaten"
86,"Johnson to Elliott, no run this is absolutely excellent from Johnson. Bouncer from only short of a length. As in this is not dug in halfway down but has gone up higher than the shoulder. He has swayed out of it"
87,"Johnson to Elliott, no run full outside off now, defended"
88,"Johnson to Elliott, 1 run full, on off, defended off the front foot, in front of point, gets a single"
89,"Johnson to Taylor, 3 runs full and wide. A half-volley. Taylor leans into it, push-drives it past cover"
90,"Johnson to Elliott, no run bouncer, pretty quick, 148ks, at the stumps. He ducks under it"
91,"Johnson to Elliott, 2 runs full this time, outside off, Elliott - despite those two bouncers - is looking to move forward, and pushes this wide of cover"
92,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, gets good bounce, Taylor is off his feet as he defends"
93,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run fuller, outside off, holds its line, hits the outside half of the bat as he defends"
94,"Hazlewood to Taylor, 3 runs nice shot. This is a length ball on off, he shuffles across the line to work this past midwicket"
95,"Hazlewood to Elliott, 1 run shuffles across to a wide length ball to run it down to third man for one"
96,"Hazlewood to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, defends"

100,"Faulkner to Taylor, 1 run moves across the line get inside the line of this length ball and works this to long leg for one"
101,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run shuffles across and drops this length ball into the leg side for one"
102,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run shuffles across to a length ball, defends it back to him"
103,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run low full toss, flicked back to him"
104,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run wide half-volley, driven to deep cover for one"
105,"Maxwell to Taylor, 2 runs low full toss, Taylor moves across to paddle this fine of fine leg. Taylor has looked on and busy today"
106,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run stays back to a length ball and punches it to cover"
107,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run half-volley, driven to long-on for one"
108,"Maxwell to Elliott, no run nicely bowled. Attacking line outside off, the ball dips on him, meaning he is not close to the pitch of the ball. Beaten on the outside edge"
109,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run wide length ball, pushed against the turn, gets a single"
110,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run half-volley outside off, driven nicely, straight to short cover"
111,"Faulkner to Elliott, 2 runs wide length ball, driven with an open face, through point, comes back for two by the time third man comes around"
112,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run full, pushed to mid-off, who is back at the 30-yard ring. Gets a single"

114,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run full, on off, pushed to mid-on, who is tight on the single"
115,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run on a length, outside off, hit straight to mid-off"
116,"Maxwell to Elliott, 2 runs reverse-paddle from just outside off, past short third man. He has not bothered to turn the face of the bat. Has played it off the back of the bat"
117,"Maxwell to Elliott, no run defended to leg"
118,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run looks for the late cut, gets a bottom edge for one"
119,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run turning into the pads, defended to leg"
120,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run paddles this full ball away fine"
121,"Maxwell to Elliott, no run Maxwell has got another. Big Show owning the big day. But Taylor suggests to him this could be bouncing over so they have reviewed this lbw decision. Elliott is beaten on the sweep. The ball has pitched outside off, turns in, goes under the bat, and hits him on the knee roll. Taylor seems to suggest it is going over, but the replay and Hawkeye suggest it is missing leg with the turn. Dharmasena will have to overturn his decision. Phew. That seems like a gamble that has paid off for New Zealand. This was a review in hope. A mini little clinching of fists from"
122,"Starc to Taylor, no run short of a length, on off, he is on his toes to defend"
123,"Starc to Taylor, 1 leg bye hit on the pad as he is beaten by the pace, but this has pitched outside leg"
124,"Starc to Elliott, no run full outside off, dug out towards cover"
125,"Starc to Elliott, no run loose drive. This is on a length, angling away. He is neither close to the pitch of the ball, nor the line of it. Beaten. Loose and uncharacteristic shot"
126,"Starc to Elliott, 3 runs this is better from Elliott. He moves across the line to get close to this length ball, and pushes this wide of mid-off"
127,"Starc to Taylor, no run uppishly pushed to mid-off, but well short of that man"
128,"Maxwell to Elliott, FOUR runs short, not too wide, but he makes room to cut it past point for four"
129,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run down the wicket to push this down the ground for one"
130,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run turning into the pads, defended to leg"
131,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run flighted just outside off, defended back to him"

133,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run length-ball offbreak, worked away for one"
134,"Starc to Elliott, no run on a length, on off, defended with an open face"
135,"Starc to Elliott, no run short of a length, outside off, looks for a cut, gets a bottom edge, Haddin flies to his left to save a few runs here. Lovely take"
136,"Starc to Elliott, no run yorker this time, Elliott equal to it. Keeps this down"
137,"Starc to Elliott, SIX runs second top-edged six. #MCGsobig #Batedgesobig. Again this short ball gets a bit big on him, Elliott is cramped, doesn"
138,"Starc to Elliott, no run lovely yorker again. On the crease, in front of middle. He has just about got the bat down in time"
139,"Starc to Elliott, no run length ball angling away, left alone"
140,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run on a length, around off, he moves across to defend this to leg"
141,"Faulkner to Taylor, 1 run full outside off, pushed to the right of mid-off for one"
142,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run short of a length, just outside off, opens the face, can't get this past backward point"
143,"Faulkner to Elliott, FOUR runs lovely shot. Elliott is looking good now. That extra cover seems to be his preferred area. Full, outside off, he stays beside the line and chips it over extra cover. Good to watch"
144,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run runs this length ball to third man to bring the fifty for the partnership"
145,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run he has moved too far across, is hit on the pad smack in front of middle stump, but the ball is clearly pitched outside leg. Another good save to his left by Haddin"
146,"Watson to Elliott, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
147,"Watson to Elliott, no run on a length, middle and off, defended off the front foot"
148,"Watson to Elliott, no run short of a length, on off, he shuffles across to work this to leg, but can"

154,"Faulkner to Elliott, FOUR runs half-volley, outside off, he has played an excellent shot. Driving it through cover. Between mid-off and extra cover. All along the ground"
155,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run good change-up. Short of a length, extra bounce with an offcutter slower ball. Beats the bat as it leaves him off the pitch"
156,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run short of a length, outside off, opens the face, gets a single to third man"
157,"Faulkner to Taylor, no run short of a length, no room, he cuts, but finds backward point"
158,"Watson to Elliott, no run on a length, on off, pushed back to him"
159,"Watson to Elliott, 1 run short of a length, on the stumps, and he backs away to run this down to third man for one"
160,"Watson to Taylor, FOUR runs draws the edge but New Zealand have had a partnership going, which means there is no slip[ in place. He pushes at a length ball outside off, the ball holds its line, takes the outside edge, and goes through the vacant slip region"
161,"Watson to Taylor, no run on a length, outside off, he shuffles across to defend it back to him"
162,"Watson to Taylor, 1 wide bouncer, but too short and too high. Called a wide"
163,"Watson to Taylor, 1 run short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
164,"Watson to Elliott, 2 runs hard drive at a wide length ball, gets a thick outside edge. Third man is a little square, but he does well with that dive to save two runs"

169,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 wide fired into the pads, a wide down the leg side"
170,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run tossed up outside off, pushed to long-off for one"
171,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run tossed up wide outside off, slower through the air, Elliott is looking for the chip over cover, but the ball arrives late, and the bat face turns in his hand. He is lucky this mis-hit hasn't carried to long-off. That brings up the fifty for Elliott. Is he doing what Warne did in 1999 World Cup? Elliott was also the top-scorer in NZ's successful chase the last time New Zealand played at MCG"
172,"Johnson to Elliott, 1 leg bye short of a length, pitched outside leg, hits him on the thigh pad. Concedes a leg-bye"
173,"Johnson to Taylor, no run short of a length, middle and off, moves across to defend this back to him"
174,"Johnson to Taylor, no run short of a length, outside off, leaves alone this offcutter. Bounces in front of the keeper"
175,"Johnson to Taylor, no run full, tailing back in a little, solidly defended back to him"
176,"Johnson to Taylor, 1 run length ball outside off, slight offcut on it, Taylor gets behind the line and opens the face to get a single to third man"

178,"Maxwell to Elliott, no run tossed up outside off, pushed against the turn, but not past cover"
179,"Maxwell to Elliott, 2 runs down the wicket flick this length ball into the leg side. They get two before the deep fielder can come in #MCGreallysobig"
180,"Maxwell to Elliott, no run lovely delivery. Tossed up outside off, dips on him, has created the gap between his body and the pitch off the ball. Elliott ends up pushing at it. The ball doesn't turn. Beats the outside edge"
181,"Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run half-volley this time. Driven to long-off for one"
182,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run full, into the pads, can't beat short midwicket"

185,"Johnson to Vettori, 1 run shuffles across, Johnson stays outside of, he is not behind the line, gets just the single to mid-on"
186,"Johnson to Elliott, no run length ball, outside off, he opens the face, but Clarke is superb here. He has positioned himself at slip. Fields this to his right"
187,"Johnson to Elliott, no run short of a length, stays a touch low, punches this to cover"
188,"Johnson to Elliott, 1 run drives on the up, goes square, to the left of point, Smith makes a diving save, but they take a single off the deflection"
189,"Johnson to Vettori, OUT this is top-quality bowling from Australia. Johnson has come back to completely outdo Vettori. Full inswinging yorker at a high pace. Off the round arm it comes, dipping on him, tailing back in, Vettori is late on it, is beaten on the inside edge, is hit on the pad, and the deflection rattles the stumps"
190,"Faulkner to Elliott, FOUR runs short, into the body, a rare loose ball from Australia. This is short, not even chest high, and at Faulkner's pace. So he pulls it over midwicket for four"
191,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run slower legcutter, beats his inside edge and also does him in for pace. Hits him on the thigh pad but this is headed down leg"
192,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run looks to stay beside the line, opens the face on a length ball, finds point"
193,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed with an open face"
194,"Faulkner to Elliott, OUT Faulkner has brought that one final big wicket. Slower ball does it again. It is so hard to pick because it comes out with the seam up. Elliot sees a length ball that he can hit over the leg side, but he is way too early into the shot. He gets the outside edge, and Faulkner's back-of-the-hand slower ball always bounces extra, which means it carries to Haddin for yet another catch. Australia all over New Zealand. A bit of a send-off again, but he gets a generous applause from the full house. raises his bat to them"
195,"Faulkner to Henry, no run yorker on off, he does well to get the bat down in time"
196,"Johnson to Southee, SIX runs Sixer Southee has hit a six first ball he faces. First intentional six of the innings/ #MCGsobig. Johnson bowls the slower ball, on a length, and he gets under it to loft it over long-on for a biggie"

198,"Johnson to Southee, 1 run clears the front leg to drive this length ball to long-on"
199,"Johnson to Henry, no run bouncer now. Won't be many slower balls around after that six first ball. He has to rush out of its line to protect his head"
200,"Johnson to Henry, no run full and straight, he backs away to drive, but finds mid-off"
201,"Johnson to Henry, no run sharp bouncer again, and no room either. He has to sway out of its line"
202,"Faulkner to Southee, no run normal pace, length ball, angling in, squeezes under his bat"
203,"Faulkner to Southee, no run short of a length, angling in, backs away to defend"
204,"Faulkner to Southee, no run short of a length, angling in, he makes room, but can't beat point with his open-face shot"
205,"Faulkner to Southee, no run slower legcutter, Southee is done in, and it follows him to beat the back-away-and-swing"

207,"Faulkner to Henry, no run drives on the up, hits the length ball straight to cover"
208,"Johnson to Southee, no run he shuffles across to look to help a short ball to fine leg. He has guessed right, in that the ball is short, but he has been beaten by the pace"
209,"Johnson to Southee, no run full and straight, makes room to hit this to extra cover. Won't get a single"
210,"Johnson to Southee, 1 run slower ball, offcutter, he mis-hits it to long-on"
211,"Johnson to Henry, no run short of a length, he backs away and hits, and is beaten by the angle"
212,"Johnson to Henry, OUT oh that is not the intention but they have got the wicket all the same. This is a yorker gone wrong. A low juicy full toss outside off with all the off-side fielders in the ring. Henry drives, but neither gets power behind it nor manages to keep it down. Easy catch for Starc at cover-point"
213,"Johnson to Boult, 1 wide tries a bouncer but is way down the leg side. Called a wide"
214,"Johnson to Boult, OUT this could be sensational. It is actually sensation regardless of the result actually. Short of a length, at the hip, defended to short leg, and Maxwell spots from the corner of his eye that Southee is a little lazy getting back into the crease at the non-striker's end. He lets rip a throw at the non-striker's end. Southee has barely a foot to go back, but Maxwell's throw has beaten him. Southee's bat has got stuck in the ground. Sensational run-out. Sums up Australia in the field today"
215,"It is not all over yet. They still need to score these runs off. In the previous match between New Zealand and Australia, 150 was almost defended. New Zealand won't give up just yet. They have come so far playing attractive aggressive cricket. No reason to not continue with it in this one final effort. You will have top join Alan Gardner to see if New Zealand can conjure something here. This is Sidharth Monga ending his World Cup. Been a pleasure bringing it to you"
216,"Australia lost the toss on a flat MCG pitch, which has resulted in scores of 300 every match and easy defence of those totals. What do they do? Mitchell Starc first bowled an excellent first spell, including yorking Brendon McCullum and bowling him out for a duck in the first over. Josh Hazlewood continued doing his best impression of Glenn McGrath, and Mitchell Johnson brought more pressure with his pace and aggression at first change. Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor then put together a partnership, took New Zealand into the Powerplay only three down, but that's when they ran into Australia's"
217,"5.57pm What a top-dog effort from Australia. They have now taken 79 of the 80 wickets available to them. While it will be pointed out that New Zealand's score is the same as India's in the 1983 final, I am sure Australia would have taken this at the start of the game"
218,"Right now, they don't need to open their mouths. Pointing at the scoreboard will do. If they close this out - as they should - then there'll be no quibbling about who are the rightful champions."
219,"Out charge the Black Caps, back into the arena. And here come Finch and Warner, like a couple of Reservoir Dogs - they look like they mean business. The G is resplendent. It is draped in green and gold right now but they'll be black and blue all over if New Zealand manage to cause an upset."
220,"Tim Southee is at the top of his mark, David Warner on strike... Two slips and a gully"
221,"Southee to Warner, no run starts on a good length, around the line of middle and off, shapes back a fraction as Warner blocks from the crease"
222,"Southee to Warner, 1 run slightly shorter and on the legs, stays back and flicks the first run of the innings down to fine leg"
223,"Southee to Finch, no run in the channel, not doing much through the air or off the pitch, Finch gets a stride in and shoulders arms"
224,"Southee to Finch, no run goes a little wider and angles this in towards off stump, holds its line, defended on the front foot"
225,"Southee to Finch, no run beaten! Moral victory to Southee - whatever that counts for - as Finch is drawn into pushing at one in the corridor"
226,"Southee to Finch, no run testing line from Southee, Finch has not been in the pink for a few weeks now, hangs his bat out but once again manages to keep it inside the line"
227,"Boult to Warner, no run sends this down on a length outside off and Warner has a flash, zips past the edge, definitely some shape there"
228,"Boult to Warner, no run in the corridor, trying to draw Warner out, doesn't bother with the feet and throws the hands, another play and miss! Swinging for both of them"
229,"Boult to Warner, 1 run pitched up on the stumps, not quite a yorker, tucked into the leg side for a single"
230,"Boult to Smith, no run full and around off stump to begin with to the new man, shuffles across and defends"

234,"Southee to Warner, 2 runs touch straight from Southee, this is flicked off the pads down to fine leg, where Vettori fields"
235,"Southee to Warner, 2 runs timing from Warner, he's going to be busy today, unless New Zealand can give him an early finish. Closes the face and punches a fullish ball back past the bowler"

237,"Southee to Warner, 1 run pitched up, gets forward and dabs another quick single down the ground"

240,"Boult to Warner, FOUR runs full outside off, Warner is on the walk, spanks a lovely cover drive for the first boundary of the innings"
241,"Boult to Warner, no run sprays this towards leg stump but it just begins to come back at the batsman, stabbed to mid-on"
242,"Boult to Warner, no run pitched up on middle and leg, defended to the on side from back in the crease"
243,"Boult to Warner, 3 leg byes length but veering towards leg, Boult striving a touch, you feel, Warner flicks it off his hips and they get three as Henry slides on the boundary at fine leg. Australia's dynamo keeps the strike"
244,"Southee to Warner, FOUR runs width, the ball isn't coming back in for Southee, Warner opens his shoulders and slaps another rasping drive through the covers"
245,"Southee to Warner, FOUR runs short now, kerplunked into the air... but it clears mid-on! Back-to-back boundaries for Warner, not the cleanest connection but it ran away"
246,"Southee to Warner, FOUR runs edged and wide of the sole catcher! What are the chances... no sooner has McCullum gone a touch more defensive, Southee draws an edge, Warner driving at a full ball but it was out of reach of the diving Taylor"
247,"Southee to Warner, 1 run length delivery, punched into the off side for a quick single"
248,"Southee to Smith, 1 wide outside off, shapes away, too far"
249,"Southee to Smith, no run goes across and is happy to leave a length ball outside off"
250,"Southee to Smith, 1 run straighter line, Smith works the ball off his pads for a single to midwicket"
251,"Boult to Smith, no run slips in the full ball on off, not quite a yorker, Smith is watchful enough to keep it out without drama"
252,"Boult to Smith, no run full and straight again, Smith reaches in front of his pad to check-drive back to mid-on"

278,"Boult to Warner, no run misses this and struck on the back pad! Boult's arms goes up but he then realises it was probably sliding by... Dharmasena thinks the same. Warner fell over that delivery, heart would have been pounding for a moment"

290,"Boult to Warner, no run half an appeal, again for lbw! Boult again thinks it was going down the leg side, no inside edge on the replay - Warner again stuck on the crease. Hawk-Eye suggests it would have shaved leg, umpire's call"

There she blows, the winning runs fittingly from Smith's bat - Australia win the World Cup final by seven wickets, New Zealand were just swept aside in the end. Smith has been one of Australia's leading lights and he had guided them home at the G"
423,"Australia will be receiving the trophy shortly, their fifth World Cup. Two years ago, they were being whitewashed in India and going out of the Champions Trophy without a win. Lehmann has helped recapture their mojo, they'll certainly celebrate under the southern cross tonight. And at the end of the Australian summer, after the pain of Phillip Hughes' passing in November, this will also be a cathartic triumph."
424,"The final, in the end, was something of a waltz but we'll not forget Baz and his Black Caps charging through the competiton with an aggressive approach that will forever leave its mark. The G got the result it wanted, however. We'll have plenty of reaction, appreciation and analysis coming up on the site, so stick around. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to bring you the action, we'll be back again in four years' time (possibly before then, too). From Sid and myself and all the guys and girls in New Zealand and Australia, India, England and the US, thanks for joining in and see you again"
425,"We've had a blast, haven't we? The batsmen certainly did, though the Man of the Final and Man of the Tournament were bowlers. We will remember spells from Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Wahab Riaz for as long as we do those innings of fury from Martin Guptill, AB de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell. Not to mention the contributions made from all across the cricketing world, from Shaiman Anwar and William Porterfield, Shapoor Zadran and Sean Williams."
426,Australia won by 7 wickets (with 101 balls remaining)
