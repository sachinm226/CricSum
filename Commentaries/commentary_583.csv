2,"Taylor to Marsh, no run fullish again and he pushes that across to the on-side"
3,"Taylor to Marsh, 3 runs there's runs now as he takes a full ball from about off stump and turns it past Benn at midwicket, whi runs after it and cuts it down near the boundary"
4,"Taylor to Watson, no run yorker-length delivery and Watson just pushes it back to Taylor"
5,"Taylor to Watson, no run some outswing for Taylor now as he lands that one of a full length and Watson leaves it be"
6,"Taylor to Watson, OUT and now there's a wicket, a big one too, to cap what could be the longest first over ever! Taylor pitches very full and angles the ball in through the air, Watson expects it to move away and doesn't get his front foot out too much but the ball dips and clips him flush on the foot"
7,"Powell to Marsh, no run good length outside off, swings in very close as Marsh opts to leave"

9,"Powell to Marsh, no run movement again, and some bounce, as Marsh allows that one pass"
10,"Powell to Marsh, 1 run pitches on leg and straightens and Marsh pushes it back past Ponting, calling for the run as he takes on to the danger end, mid-off running in fast"

200,"Gayle to Hussey, 1 run pushed away for a quick single into the off side"
201,"Gayle to Clarke, FOUR runs very good shot from Clarke, Gayle pushing them through a tad quickly and Clarke waits, then with very soft hands cuts it so fine that it would have gone between the keeper and first slip, not that there was a slip, and it runs away for four.

227,"Taylor to White, (no ball) 2 runs poor stuff, a front-foot no-ball, and he gives White room to cut past point"
228,"Taylor to White, 2 runs gives him more room, White cuts up and over point, not timed well and Pollard does well to run across in front of square and keep them to two"
229,"Taylor to White, FOUR runs powerful shot, White makes room and muscles this very straight and a sliding long-on cannot get there, that shot came up because of the length Taylor bowled"
230,"Taylor to White, 1 run good grief, Fletcher's dropped him at deep square leg! White went hooking a short ball, undone by the sluggish bounce, but Taylor is let down by his fielder, keeping his eyes on it but not settling himself and spilling a simple catch, in and out"

242,"Benn to Hussey, no run Hussey sweeps, can't beat the man behind square"
243,"Benn to Hussey, SIX runs tossed up outside off, Hussey picks this one up early and sweeps with the turn, it flies over deep midwicket and bounces just over the rope, Pollard dives in the deep but he was never really near that one. First six of the innings"
244,"Benn to Hussey, 1 run flatter this time from Benn, Hussey tucks a single square"
245,"Benn to Clarke, OUT and Benn breaks through! He's coming around the wicket, sends in a quicker ball that pitches on off, Clarke is walking across and trying to clip through leg, he's struck in line and that was not spinning, probably taking leg stump"
246,"Bravo to Hopes, 1 run makes room and skips down, Bravo knew he was coming and bowled it short and wide and Hopes swats it off the toe end of the bat down to mid-off"
247,"Bravo to White, 2 runs full and down leg stump as he sees White moving about, well bowled, so thats a clipped couple more to the score out to deep fine leg"
248,"Bravo to White, 1 bye slower ball, White swings with his eyes shut, fails to connect, and another silly fumble by Browne gives up a run ... he's had a poor day behind the stumps"

253,"Taylor to Hopes, 1 wide drops in a bouncer with no pace on it at all, Hopes swats and misses and the umpire calls it wide as it misses his bat ... Taylor doesn't like the call, marginally above the head, but not enough to be called wide"

256,"Taylor to Hopes, 1 run slips out a loopy full toss which Hopes can't put away, flicked to the deep"

258,"Taylor to Hopes, no run bouncer to end the over, Hopes backs away and flays at it, trying to uppercut it over gully but the ball beats him so Australia are kept to 213 for 5"
259,"13:30pm Australia lost early wickets, Clarke and Hussey then buckled down on a sluggish track to add exactly 100 in 29 overs. That sounds extremely dull yes, but with an inexperienced order to follow the senior duo opted to bat it out and keep wickets in hand. Both scored sapping half-centuries before West Indies struck back. White finished unbeaten on 40, unable to really smack the"

267,"Bracken to Fletcher, no run outside off and Fletcher cuts very hard, but straight to backward point where Ponting does the fielding"

269,"Bracken to Fletcher, no run defended on the front foot now"
270,"Bracken to Fletcher, no run a hint of inswing, Fletcher works it straight down into the turf"

273,"Lee to Fletcher, no run this time he does play, some seam away though from Lee and it beats the edge of Fletcher's bat"

287,"Lee to Fletcher, no run pushed away to midwicket"
288,"Lee to Fletcher, 1 wide that is fast and short, but it's just a fraction too short and well over Fletcher's head, so it's a wide"
289,"Lee to Fletcher, no run oh, that's a very good ball, on a good length and moving away off the seam, Fletcher tries to drive and it beats is bat by what must have been millimetres"
290,"Lee to Fletcher, no run this time Fletcher tries to cut hard, and again it beats the bat"

295,"Bracken to Fletcher, no run oh dear, Fletcher almost gets himself run out in casual fashion like in the first ODI. He tucked it behind square and took off immediately, Gayle said no, and Fletcher slowly turned and strolled back, really not aware that a throw was coming in from square leg"

299,"Lee to Gayle, no run testing Gayle with a slightly fuller ball right on line, Gayle gets the bat down and defends"
300,"Lee to Gayle, no run another cracking ball from Lee. It's pitched on leg, seamed away from Gayle, who was really squared up and it beats the outside edge"
301,"Lee to Gayle, no run another one tests Gayle, it straightens a touch and there's some brave judgement from Gayle to leave that one"
302,"Lee to Gayle, FOUR runs and Gayle finally gets one he can go after. A little wide outside off, Gayle drives off the back foot through cover and it flies away in the air for four"
303,"Lee to Gayle, (no ball) 1 run fullish ball, Gayle drives to mid off and the next one will be a free hit as Lee has overstepped"
304,"Lee to Fletcher, FOUR runs and Fletcher makes good use of the free hit. Lee digs one in short outside off, Fletcher chases it with a not-very-pretty but highly effective slap that flies in the air between mid off and cover and away to the boundary"

322,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run left alone outside off"
323,"Watson to Fletcher, 2 runs on the pads first up, Fletcher flicks it deliberately in the air and safely over midwicket, not timed well enough to get to the boundary and Chanderpaul, perhaps hampered by his calf problem, doesn't want a third"
