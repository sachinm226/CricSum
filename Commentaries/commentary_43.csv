420,"Henriques to Rahul, no run 107kph, good length outside off, he mistimes to cover"
421,"Hazlewood to Kohli, 3 runs 129kph, full on leg, he chips this high in the air over midwicket, Finch has a long chase from the circle but he does well to save one run"
422,"Hazlewood to Rahul, FOUR runs length ball gets punished over midwicket! He didn't nail it. It wasn't that short but off the front foot he pulled it high over midwicket and it bounces into the rope"
423,"Hazlewood to Rahul, FOUR runs cracked wide of third man! Too much width at 137kph, he thrashes the hands through it and it races away"
424,"Hazlewood to Rahul, no run slower ball, 127kph, it takes Rahul on the pad as he tries to work behind square, there's an appeal for lbw but it is way too high"

428,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run tossed up on off, driven firmly from the crease through cover"
429,"Zampa to Kohli, FOUR runs imperious. A couple of steps down, a bit of room and he blasts this over extra cover and into the boundary. Just looks so dominant when he plays that"

435,"Hazlewood to Kohli, 1 run short ball on the stumps, doesn't bounce sharply, he swivels and pulls from rib height to deep square leg"
436,"Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 run big appeal for lbw, not given. Finch indicates height might be a problem and he's right. It jagged in and struck him on the thigh pad, he was looking to pull"
437,"Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT Super catch by Henriques at midwicket. Kohli got out in a similar manner in the first ODI and Hazlewood has provided a huge breakthrough. Back of a length, Kohli unleashes a pull while advancing, timed much better than he had in the first ODI, but Henriques at midwicket d"

447,"Hazlewood to Hardik, 1 run was moving across but Hazlewood kept it well outside off and Hardik cramped for room to this back of length ball. Ends up half-edging, half-guiding it to third man. Bounced more than he expected, had to play it near his ribs"

449,"Hazlewood to Hardik, no run short ball, he was expecting it perhaps, moved across and threw everything into a pull shot, but can't connect. Goes over his left shoulder"
450,"Hazlewood to Hardik, SIX runs Pandya power. That's not such a bad ball but when he nails his shots, there's no stopping them. A touch too short and he swats it across the line - goes flat and hard, all the way over deep midwicket"
451,"Starc to Rahul, no run angling into him on a length, pushed back down the pitch"
452,"Starc to Rahul, no run full angling in on middle stump, steered to short third man. Smith's there and he dives to his left to stop the ball. He's unstoppable today is Smith"
453,"Starc to Rahul, no run yorker on middle and off, mis-times his drive to mid-off"

457,"Cummins to Rahul, no run back of a length outside off, mis-times his pull to mid-on"

459,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run moves across and tries to smack a pull shot to the boundary but doesn't get the timing or placement quite right. Bounces down to deep midwicket"
460,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 run was moving across but the bowler keeps it on his front pad and Hardik can only nudge it away for a single"

469,"Cummins to Hardik, no run length outside off, he's moving across and slashes this fiercely but can't beat extra cover"
470,"Cummins to Hardik, no run great bowling. He was moving across but the bowler still kept it wide outside off, and just inside the tramline. Pandya decides again reaching for it and potentially mis-hitting"
471,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 wide full toss, this one is just beyond the line of control, so to speak, and it's a wide"
472,"Cummins to Hardik, no run and this one doesn't bounce as much as Hardik thought. Moving across, covers the line well to pull this, but the ball goes under the bat"
473,"Cummins to Hardik, no run fuller and still wide of off. Pandya stays still that time and launches into a booming drive, but only connects with air. This is superb from Cummins to a big-hitter like Pandya who is in form"
474,"Cummins to Hardik, no run length well wide of off stump, moving across again, throws his bat at it to crash through offside but he hasn't nailed a single shot this over. This one takes the under edge and bounces to Carey"

482,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 run yorker length outside off, he gets bat down horizontal to steer it. Flies to Zampa's right at short third man but he puts in a dive and gets a palm to it. can't really call it a drop"
483,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run back of a length outside off, slashed to deep point"
484,"Cummins to Hardik, FOUR runs back of length on the stumps, Pandya doesn't try to hit it too hard this time, so even though he's not hit it very fluently, he's timed it well enough to find the deep square leg boundary with his pull"
485,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 run full outside off, gets low and drives to deep point"
486,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run chipped in the air but not in Finch's reach at point. that seemed to really stick in the pitch, on a length outside off, he was too early into his cut, it ballooned off the upper edge.

488,"Zampa to Hardik, 1 run flat and well wide of off, he chops it to deep extra cover"

490,"Zampa to Rahul, 2 runs dropped by Finch running backwards from point. Went down on his knee to crash this through the offside, gets a top edge that swirls over point. The wind wouldn't have made it easy as Finch running back can't even lay hand on it"
491,"Zampa to Rahul, OUT and he's finally caught. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take. After being nearly caught for two balls in a row, Rahul goes off the third, a routine top edge lobbing up to the fielder. Was swiping across the line again but this was nicely flighted and dipped, got"

502,"Starc to Hardik, (no ball) holes out to deep midwicket. He had to go for the big hits, but Australia have strangled him. This was dug into the pitch back of a length and he was cramped for room, tried to pull. Couldn't control it. oh wait a minute, it's a no ball. He's overstepped. Pandya stay"
503,"Starc to Jadeja, SIX runs boom. This is the Jadeja who was in prime IPL hitting form. Full toss, low outside off, a yorker gone wrong. Those are not so easy to hit but Jadeja has the room to baseball slug it over midwicket. well over."
