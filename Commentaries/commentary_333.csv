0,"10am: England win the toss and bat, there's no - *intake of breath* - Graeme Swann or Steven Finn in their XI. Swann pulled up with a sore back, with Finn left out on grounds of form. James Tredwell plays, as does Ravi Bopara, so England have already abandoned their five batsmen, five seamers masterplan in their first game of the tournament."
1,"10.10am: Okay, have you updated your Ashes swingometer, then? An injury to Swann (though we don't know how serious it is) will cause a shiver down the spine of many England fans but Tredwell is a very capable deputy, as he showed against New Zealand the other day, as well as in the fifth Australia ODI last summer."
2,"10.20am: Australia, it should be remembered, have won their last six ODIs, including a whitewash of West Indies; they'll be hoping to chip away at England's still-fragile confidence in this format, as New Zealand did to good effect over the last week. As far as Ashes omens go, if Bailey and co can engineer a surprise victory, it may well carry echoes of the mee"
3,"10.25am: The teams are strolling out for the anthems, a few sparklers having just gone off on the outfield. For apple types, at this juncture I'd like to point you in the direction of our new iPhone app, available from the iTunes store. Click, click, click."
4,"By the way, you can also follow the match with Gnasher on our social scorecard. It's got graphs, tweets and whizzy stuff like that."
5,"Mitchell Starc has the ball in hand, Alastair Cook standing tall... are you ready for this? Hang on, Cook isn't, there's someone moving behind the bowler's arm. Tum-ti-tum. Let's try again..."
6,"Starc to Cook, FOUR runs overpitched on leg stump, nice juicy volley to begin with from Starc and Cook clumps it through backward square with relish, to raucous cheering from around the ground"
7,"Starc to Cook, no run good length, in the channel outside off stump, much better line and Cook shoulders arms as it shapes away"
8,"Starc to Cook, 1 run full and sliding on to the pads again, worked finer, towards long leg, Cook wants two but they decide against doing anything silly"

19,"Starc to Cook, (no ball) 2 runs confusion, appeals, overthrows, chaos! Starc oversteps to concede a no-ball and Cook then has to scramble back to just beat a direct hit from point, Bell had gone charging down the pitch anyway, the ball deflects through midwicket after clipping the bails and they pick up a couple anyway"
20,"Starc to Cook, 2 runs pitched up, Cook goes for a heave straight out of the farmyard, so agricultural was it, more air than distance but it clears mid-off for a couple"

45,"McKay to Cook, no run pitched up around off stump, played towards mid-off coming forward"

75,"Watson to Cook, OUT he's done it, Watson makes the breakthrough, drawing Cook into a drive to be caught behind! Cook will feel he should have pinged that through the covers, it was a little wide, on a good length but they've not had any problems hitting on the up this morning - just a thin snick of bat and Cook trudges off having made another solid start"

568,"Bopara to Faulkner, no run full ball on the stumps, pushed back to the bower who takes the catch, surely a bump ball and they're going to check again! How many reviews have we seen today?

They have a real job on their hands t"
