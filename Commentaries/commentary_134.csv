28,"Short to du Plessis, 2 runs finds space, gets some fortune...came down the pitch, done in the air, miscues his lofted drive but it lobs between cover running back and long-off coming in"
29,"Short to du Plessis, FOUR runs what power in that! That's a crunching, skimming cover drive which reaches the boundary in the blink of an eye"

41,"Stanlake to du Plessis, 2 runs down the pitch again, it's a short delivery, swatted into the leg side...tennis-style"
42,"Stanlake to du Plessis, FOUR runs a big full toss, just manages to clear mid-on, didn't get it as cleanly as he wanted, came low down off the bat...Coulter-Nile couldn't quite get it with a leap"
43,"Stanlake to du Plessis, OUT a brilliant parried boundary catch by Maxwell, we see them pretty often these days but they are still fantastic.

65,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run back of a length at off stump, 143kph, worked out to deep midwicket"
66,"Rabada to Lynn, 4 leg byes gets the line wrong, angled into the pads, just takes the thigh guard and it just has the legs to trickle into the boundary"

74,"Ngidi to Finch, 2 runs dropped! And another mess-up in the field for South Africa. Three fielders converging and none of them really wanted it. Phehlukwayo the man who ended up dropping it. Finch was followed by a short-of-a-length delivery, sent it very high into midwicket. David Miller, running in off the boundary, may have had a better chance"

77,"Morris to Lynn, FOUR runs short of a length, a short-arm pull clears mid-on with some ease"

98,"Shamsi to Carey, 2 runs swept to deep midwicket"
99,"Shamsi to Carey, 2 runs sweetly struck, lofted straight down the ground, long-on does well to get across"
100,"Shamsi to Carey, 1 run gives himself room to a shorter delivery but it's just a single to long-on"
101,"Shamsi to Maxwell, 1 run full, can't get underneath it, dragged through midwicket"
102,"Morris to Maxwell, 2 runs gets the yorker in but isn't backed up in the field, sliced towards backward point who dives over it"

123,"South Africa win by 21 runs and take this T10 match to follow the one-day series. Didn't look like we'd get a game at one stage.

Particularly noteworthy were the performances of Morris and Shamsi in their first outings of the tour."

125,"Player of the match is Tabraiz Shamsi, SA"
