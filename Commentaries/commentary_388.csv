0,"Deonarine to Hussey, no run defended off the front foot"
1,"Deonarine to Hussey, OUT a most unHussey-like dismissal. This is soft, but West Indies have deserved some luck. Just an innocuous little length ball outside off, Hussey pushes at it, slightly loosely, and hits it waist high to short extra cover. Deonarine has broken yet another partnership, and Hussey is cross with himself"
2,"Deonarine to Hilfenhaus, no run slow slow offbreak, turning down leg, and left alone"
3,"Deonarine to Hilfenhaus, no run full, straight and quick, pushed back to him"
4,"Deonarine to Hilfenhaus, no run short of a length, stays low, defended off the back foot"
5,"Deonarine to Hilfenhaus, no run another super-slow offbreak, at 67ks, Hilfy waits and waits, and defends in front of leg"
6,"Shilling to Pattinson, OUT after one time, it is two time. They have waited hours for one edge, but like buses two have followed each other. Both set batsmen gone. Shilly bowls a slow offbreak on middle and leg, Patto's bat turns early, and it lobs off the leading edge. They nearly make a meal of it as nobody calls for it. Barath has takes a few steps back from silly point to catch, but hang on. Bravo moves in late from cover, and takes the catch. Barath is wondering where the ball is. All's well, though"
7,"Shilling to Lyon, no run flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
8,"Shilling to Lyon, no run Lyon pushes forward again, not quite to the pitch of it, but defends solidly"
9,"Shilling to Lyon, no run appeal for lbw as this turns in sharply, and beats the inside edge, but he is given not out. Fair enough too, When the ball turns that much, it either hits the pad outside the line or misses leg stump after pitching. The latter in this case"
10,"Shilling to Lyon, no run forward-defensive to a fullish delivery"
11,"Shilling to Lyon, no run pushes right forward to defend"
12,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, no run good start. Short of a length, around of,f holds its line, beats the edge"
13,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, 1 run short of a length again, guided through the vacant gull region for one"
14,"Roach to Lyon, 1 run short, into the rib, tucked away to long leg"
15,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, no run full on off, driven to cover. Good shot for a No. 10"
16,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, no run looks to cut this, cant beat point"
17,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfy fends at a short delivery, pushes it uppishly, but to the right of gully, and it doesn't carry to point either"
18,"Shilling to Lyon, FOUR runs full on off, sweeps, the bat comes down from high, keeps it down, gets four past square leg"
19,"Shilling to Lyon, no run flighted outside off, turning in, defended solidly"
20,"Shilling to Lyon, no run nice, gets this to dip, creates a gap between bat and pad, and then it turns in sharply, but the ball hits the inside half of the bat, and dies down"
21,"Shilling to Lyon, no run looks to sweep, is beaten, is hit on the pad, but he has got himself outside the line of off"
22,"Shilling to Lyon, 1 run another attempt at sweep, this time he manages to make contact. Bravo is at backward short leg, but this is hit hard, and all he manages is to get a hand to it. A single conceded"
23,"Shilling to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus immediately reviews this. Gould took ages to make his mind up and raise the finger, but Hilfy didn't even take a second to make that t-sign. The immediate question is the amount of turn. This is turning in sharply, from well outside off, and hits him in front of the stumps. The leg stump is visible, but Hilfy trusts it to turn down. And so it does, missing leg, according to the replays. And thus the decision is overturned"
24,"Roach to Lyon, no run length ball, misdirected, down the leg side"
25,"Roach to Lyon, 1 run push-drives at this length ball outside off, gets a single past cover"
26,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs that's some shot. Front-foot cut? Punch? Call it whatever. Short of a length. Doesn't care he is forward, and goes through with it, and places it between gully and point"
27,"Roach to Hilfenhaus, OUT Bowled'im. No DRS here. This one nips back in from short of a length, from just outside off. Hits the thigh pad outside the line of leg, but the ricochet hits the stumps"
28,"Roach to Beer, 2 runs full, on the pads, clipped away, already the calling is a little staggered, but they come back for two"
29,"Roach to Beer, OUT Beer reviews now. He has been given out lbw as he has shuffled too far across. This is short of a length, nips in from outside off, Beer is across, his inside edge is beaten, and he is hit high on the pad, in front of middle and leg. Erasmus gives him out immediately, Beer reviews immediately. The replays show it to be hitting the top of leg, which means he is gone, and Roach gets five"
30,"3.39pm That's the end of the innings. Roach gets pats on the back for his Michelle. And before he walks off, Kemar raises the ball to the crowd. West Indies have come back rather well after an unfortunate spell of play. Hussey and Pattinson nearly ran away with this, but West Indies have come back to take the last four for 14. I am sure West Indies would have taken it had they been offered five wickets for 103 runs at the start of the day's play. Apart from Roach, credit is due to Shillingford too, who bowled nearly a whole ODI innings -"

44,"Beer to Baugh, no run length ball, middle and leg, defended back to him"
45,"Beer to Baugh, no run misses on a sweep, the ball is headed down leg"
46,"Beer to Baugh, no run appeal for lbw as Beer bowls an arm ball, but Baugh has got himself forward, and outside the line"
47,"Beer to Baugh, no run cuts this one, but not past point"
48,"Beer to Baugh, 1 run another arm ball, another appeal, but this one has hit the inside edge. A crazy, risky single ensues"
49,"Beer to Edwards, no run Fired in at off, defended back to him"
50,"Lyon to Baugh, no run flighted outside off, Baugh presses forward, and defends"
51,"Lyon to Baugh, no run uppishly flicked with the turn, but short of short midwicket"
52,"Lyon to Baugh, no run and Baugh doesn't want to keep defending. He goes for a wild slog-sweep to a ball outside off. He has eliminated the lbw, but could have got a top edge. He misses, and is hit well outside the line of off"

57,"Beer to Baugh, no run full, middle and leg, defended off the front foot"
58,"Beer to Baugh, FOUR runs short and wide, there is a deep point in place, but Baugh has cut this in front of square, and Hilfenhaus, the man at deep point, can't get there"
59,"9.35am A good start for Australia. They have answered the first call of duty, which was to take this last wicket. They now have a lead of 54 on a breaking pitch, but do they have enough time to force a result? And do they need to be cautious in the third innings to avoid what happened to West Indies in the last game? We will be back soon to see how approach the third innings"
60,Innings Start
61,"""This will be an interesting measure of Clarkes captaincy. So far he is doing well, but how does he do under pressure... ?"" Asks Lucas. For the moment, Lucas, he brings back Beer. A slip, a silly point, a short leg in"
