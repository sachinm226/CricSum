241,So Sri Lanka need to keep Australia to 238 or less to make the finals. I'll be back in 30 minutes for the chase.
242,"6.10 pm Sri Lanka have finished with 238, a score that is less than par on this pitch. They were set for at least 40 more when Sangakkara and Chandimal were steering the innings. But they fell away after that partnership. Christian wrecked the innings with a hat-trick and finished with 5 for 31. Pattinson was making a comeback from injury and he took four wickets as well."
243,I wonder what the Indians are doing now. They will know in a few hours whether they need to head to the airport tomorrow or not. Sri Lanka need to tie or win to make the finals. They have 238 to defend.
