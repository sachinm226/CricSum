0,9.35am Australia win the toss and choose to bowl in Malik's 100th T20I
1,"Stanlake to Hafeez, no run back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease, bouncing and seaming away outside off. Hafeez lets it go. He gestures to Fakhar that the ball moved away"
2,"Stanlake to Hafeez, no run shorter and outside off, Hafeez rides it out to backward point with soft hands"
3,"Stanlake to Hafeez, OUT Stanlake strikes with his third ball and has Hafeez nicking off for a duck. Australia's beanpole fast bowler runs in hard, hits the deck hard, and finds extra bounce. It fizzes from a back of a length, the line is outside off, hint of away movement, Hafeez simply spars at it and edges it to first slip, where Finch completes a sharp overhead catch"
4,"Stanlake to Talat, no run much fuller and angling across off, Talat stretches out and carves a drive to backward point"
5,"Stanlake to Talat, no run back of a length and skidding through on off stump, Talat hangs back and jams it out"
6,"Stanlake to Talat, 1 run much fuller and angling away wide outside off, Talat throws his hands at the ball and stabs it away to deep third man. Excellent start from Stanlake"
7,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, no run he draws an lbw appeal right away. Umpire Tiffin shoots down the appeal, though. Inswinging yorker, Talat camps back and is pinned on the pad. It pitched in line and might have crashed into leg stump but umpire Tiffin wasn't interested"
8,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, FOUR runs dug in short on leg stump, this is more a short-arm flap than a short-arm pull. Hit in the air but wide of midwicket"
9,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, FOUR runs here comes Talat: down the track, takes it on a half-volley outside off and belts it through the covers. There's no stopping that"
10,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, no run hurled short and angling across off, Talat looks to ramp it over slip. No contact in the end"
11,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, 1 run pretty full on middle and leg, squeezed square on the leg side for one"
12,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, 1 run full and angling away outside off, drags an inside edge behind square on the leg side"
13,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run very full and wide outside off, Zaman stays leg-side of the ball and flashes it straight to mid-off"
14,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run dragged short on off, Zaman camps on the back foot and swats it straight to midwicket"
15,"Stanlake to Zaman, 1 run good length and tucks up the batsman for room, jabbed to the covers for a speedy single"
16,"Stanlake to Talat, no run chest-high short ball on leg stump, cramps the batsman for room again, and pings the body. Fiery pace and bounce from Stanlake"
17,"Stanlake to Talat, OUT One-hander from Finch, running across from first slip and pulling off a stunner at where gully may have been. Another lifter outside off, Talat rises with it and aims to fend it away. Steep bounce for Stanlake. The ball balloons off the glove. Finch runs across to his left, stretches out one hand and sends back Talat"
18,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, 2 runs too full and straight, Sarfraz sits back, perhaps waiting for the short one, and clips it neatly through square leg"
19,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, no run back of a length and outside off, punched through the line to mid-off"
20,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, no run short and on middle, no room for the batsman to free his arms, jabbed back to the bowler"
21,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, no run back of a length on middle and leg, punched back to Richardson again"
22,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, FOUR runs full and angling away outside off, Zaman likes it there. He stays leg-side of the ball and blazes it through the covers. He doesn't move his feet much muscles it away"
23,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, no run short on middle, backs away and stabs it straight to backward point"
24,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, no run Zaman ventures outside leg and aims to cut it on the up over backward point. But this short ball beats him for pace and bounce"
25,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run on a length and just a shade outside off, bunted back to Stanlake off the front foot"
26,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, 1 run Sarfraz rides the bounce of a short ball outside off and secures a single to deep third man"
27,"Stanlake to Zaman, OUT Has Zaman been strangled down the leg side? Umpire Jeremiah Matibiri raises his finger. Zaman doesn't seem pleased but no DRS in this series to challenge the on-field out decision. Dug in down the leg side, rushes Zaman into a hook. There's a deflection - not sure if it was off the glove or bat - but Zaman has to exit. Three wickets in three overs for Stanlake"
28,"Stanlake to Malik, no run welcomes Malik to the crease with a bouncer, he sways out of the way"
29,"Stanlake to Malik, no run Malik gets on top of a short ball outside off and punches to backward point"

32,"Stoinis to Malik, no run keeps cramping the right-handers for room as Malik shifts back and flicks to midwicket"

34,"Stoinis to Malik, no run blocks a good length ball on and around off stump. Malik plays it with such soft hands that the ball almost rolls onto his stumps!"

36,"Stoinis to Malik, 1 run works a shortish delivery on off stump to midwicket and pinches the single."
37,"Stanlake to Malik, 1 run short and wide outside off, Malik gets on top of the bounce and slaps it away to sweeper cover"
38,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, OUT Four wickets in four overs for Stanlake. Credit to Finch for giving him four overs on the bounce with the new ball. Stanlake's USP: extra bounce comes to the fore again. Bursts from a back of a length just outside off, seams away, Sarfraz is squared up"
39,"Stanlake to Asif Ali, 1 wide bouncer, too high, wide called"
40,"Stanlake to Asif Ali, no run much fuller on off now, Asif keeps it out"
41,"Stanlake to Asif Ali, no run back of a length and angling into middle, pushed back to the bowler"
42,"Stanlake to Asif Ali, 1 run wide of the crease, short and holds its line outside off, run down to deep third man for one"
43,"Stanlake to Malik, no run Stanlake hits a hard length outside off - neither driveable nor pullable - jabbed to the covers. Stanlake ends with 4-0-8-4 What a spell from him"
44,"Tye to Asif Ali, 1 run back of a length and nipping in to take the inside edge and roll away to the leg side"
45,"Tye to Malik, 1 run slower knuckle ball outside off, waits for the ball to arrive and helps it to third man"
46,"Tye to Asif Ali, 1 run the umpire and the non-striker are in the firing line. The umpire swerves away but Malik cops a blow. He wrings his gloves in pain. On a length and outside off, drilled straight past the bowler. Malik is in pain. He needs some medical attention"

51,"Agar to Malik, 1 run back of a length and breaks away outside off, firmly punched through the cover-point region off the back foot"
52,"Agar to Asif Ali, 1 run skids in on middle, tip and run to short cover. The fielder swoops down on the ball and effects a direct hit at the non-striker's end but Asif Ali slides his bat in"

59,"Stoinis to Asif Ali, 1 run, OUT short and angling into the hips, short-armed away to deep square leg. There's a horrible mix-up between the wickets, the last thing Pakistan wanted now. There's two on offer. Asif wants two, Malik isn't interested. Maddinson slides, gathers the ball, and throws it to the keeper to catch Malik short"
60,"Stoinis to Shadab, 1 wide bouncer on middle, beats the hook and slides down leg for a wide"
61,"Stoinis to Shadab, 1 run full and outside off, drives and edges it to third man"

65,"Agar to Shadab, 2 runs gets down low to sweep a tossed up delivery on middle and leg to long leg"

68,"Agar to Shadab, no run lunges forward to ease the length delivery on off stump to cover"

70,"Stoinis to Asif Ali, no run back of a length and cramping him for room. Asif short-arm pulls to midwicket"
71,"Stoinis to Asif Ali, OUT misreads the length and pays the price! This is not short enough to play a cross-bat shot. But that's what he does, looking to pull the quick, skiddy delivery through square leg. The reasonably good length ball zips through his defences and takes out off stump"
72,"Stoinis to Faheem, no run turns a fullish delivery to short midwicket"
73,"Stoinis to Faheem, 2 runs shortish and outside off, he punches to point and sets off for a quick single. The throw comes into the bowler's end, from Aaron Finch, but the man backing up, Travis Head, doesn't do well and gives up an overthrow"

83,"Agar to Faheem, 1 run opens the face and slices the fuller delivery outside off to backward point"

86,"Agar to Faheem, no run works it to midwicket again"
87,"Tye to Shadab, no run a back of a length delivery holds up in the pitch and makes Shadab look very awkward as he tries to flick to the leg side. Suffers a leading edge, but it lands safely at cover"
88,"Tye to Shadab, 1 run whips a fuller delivery to midwicket"
89,"Tye to Faheem, no run defends a good length ball to cover"
90,"Tye to Faheem, SIX runs launches it over deep square leg! Stoinis goes short and here he offers room for the left-hander to free the arms. And Ashraf absolutely loves it"
91,"Tye to Faheem, FOUR runs another lovely shot! Straight down the ground! This is a fuller delivery, which Ashraf probably expects after bulldozing that last short ball. Strides easily forward and lifts it over mid-off"
92,"Tye to Faheem, FOUR runs pure elegance! After caning the ball out of the park, he shows he has the finesse to hit it all along the ground too. A pristine cover drive, his front foot moving towards the ball quite gleefully"
93,"Agar to Shadab, 1 run steps out to drive a tossed up delivery to long-off"
94,"Agar to Faheem, 1 run defends a good length ball behind point and they take on Finch's arm. It's risky... but Shadab puts his head down and keeps running full tilt"

100,"Jhye Richardson to Shadab, 1 run back of a length and angling in towards middle stump, tip and run to the covers"
101,"Jhye Richardson to Faheem, OUT Richardson bounces out Ashraf. Chest-high short ball angling across off stump from over the wicket, rushes the batsman into a hook. He only top-edges it hiiiiiiigh in the air. It drops down into the lap of Tye at fine leg"

115,"Jhye Richardson to Nawaz, 1 wide back-of-the-hand slower ball but floated past the tramline, off-side wide"
116,"Jhye Richardson to Nawaz, 2 runs Dropped by Stoinis running in from long-on. On a length and outside off, Nawaz clears his front leg and swipes it in the air. Stoinis misjudges it and shells it with the sun squinting into his eyes"
117,"Jhye Richardson to Nawaz, no run slower yorker, wide outside off, sneaks under the bat. Good finish from Richardson"
118,"Tye to Shadab, SIX runs pitched up and outside off, Shadab stays leg-side of the ball, reaches out for the ball with his hands and sends the ball soaring over the covers with a clean swing"
119,"Tye to Shadab, OUT full and wide outside off again, Shadab is happy to stay leg-side of the ball, again, but this is a slower one and the batsman toe-ends a catch to cover. Shadab has given Pakistan something to bowl at. Head dives forward and makes a tough catch look easy"

121,"Tye to Hasan Ali, 1 wide off-side wide"

123,"Tye to Nawaz, OUT Tye wraps Pakistan up for 116! Very full on middle and leg, not quite a yorker, Nawaz gets under the length. He swings, gets more height as opposed to distance. Agar sprints in from long-on, dives forward, and snaffles it"
124,11.35am Pakistan's eight-match winning streak in T20Is is under serious threat. It was Billy Stanlake who ripped through Pakistan's batting line-up with pace and bounce. He claimed 4 for 8 in an uninterrupted opening burst with the new ball to expose the middle order to the change bowlers. Andrew Tye then made light work of the tail. That Pakistan have something to bowl at is down to Shadab's cameo. He has plenty to do with

195,"12.40pm Finch's fifty has made light work of this 117 chase. But, it was Stanlake who had set up this victory with 4 for 8 - the second-best T20I figures for Australia. He ran in hard, hit the pitch harder, and hustled Pakistan for pace and bounce. He has brought Pakistan's eight-match winning streak to a grinding halt.
