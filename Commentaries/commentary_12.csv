0,"16.1;?;Starc to Bravo, no run low full toss on fifth stump at shin height, Bravo backs away and his head flails while swinging wildly and missing.;"
1,"9.08 pm Far cry from the first innings last night by West Indies. Simmons, Hetmyer Bravo and Russell all with significant contributions to get the hosts to 196. Starc's mighty struggles continue and nobody else really helped to cover that up. This will be a difficult chase for the visitors. Stay with us as Andrew McGlashan takes over the central commentary position for the start of the chase."
2,Cottrell returns for a death over.
3,"Cottrell to Starc, no run short on the stumps, pulled along the ground into midwicket but picks out the man on the ring."
4,"Cottrell to Starc, 1 run full on off stump at 130 kph, driven back past Cottrell to long-on for one."
5,"Cottrell to Zampa, 1 run slower ball lands short on the stumps, swats this high over the ring landing well short of Bravo at long-on."
6,"Cottrell to Starc, 1 run short and wide on fifth stump, slices a cut behind point and kept to one by a good track and relay from Fletcher."
7,"Cottrell to Hazlewood, 1 wide bouncer outside off, too high for Hazlewood to play and a bonus run and ball will come."
8,"Cottrell to Hazlewood, FOUR runs full on middle, backs away to drive and a thick edge goes wide of Pooran to the third man rope."
9,"Gayle to Starc, 1 run full on the stumps, driven to long-on."
10,"That's it from us tonight. Come back in two days for the third match in this series when I'll be back on the ball-by-ball duties with Andrew McGlashan. Until then, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care!"
11,"10.52 pm Australia lose 10 wickets in a T20 for the second time in a row, first time that has happened to them since 2010. Last night's win is proven to be no fluke for the hosts as they romp home by 56 runs again in St Lucia. Once again the Australia batting looks feeble after the top order is back in the sheds. Meanwhile the West Indies middle-order depth boosted them to a big total before the likes of Walsh Jr, Cottrell, Russell, and Bravo bowled intelligently and were backed up by superb fielding to defend the total."
12,West Indies won by 56 runs
