418,"Finch to Kohli, no run flatter delivery first up for Virat, who goes on the back foot and defends it to cover"
419,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye fuller delivery on the pads, Dhawan wanted to paddle it fine, but gets hit on the pads. But that would have gone down the leg side with the angle"
420,"Maxwell to Kohli, 2 runs pushed through on the middle and leg line, Kohli dabs it towards square leg with soft hands and is quick to turn and call for a second"

431,"Doherty to Kohli, FOUR runs oh he steps out again and is not to the pitch, but still goes forward with his aimed inside out shot towards extra cover, it just goes over the fielder at short cover"
432,"Doherty to Kohli, no run goes on the back foot, and punches it to cover this time"
433,"Doherty to Kohli, SIX runs he has clobbered that high and long, it's disappeared in the crowd at deep midwicket. That is some violent hit this one"
434,"Doherty to Kohli, FOUR runs the bowler was forced to shorten his length, but he makes the mistake of giving Kohli room. Instead of violence he chooses finesse, guiding it fine with a late cut"
435,"Doherty to Kohli, 2 runs comes forward and drives the full delivery to long off for a single"

440,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run 136 kph, length ball which is pushed to long off for a single. Smart batting here from Kohli"

448,"McKay to S Dhawan, 2 runs 125 kph, brings this in closer and on a length as Dhawan looks to chop this behind square, but gets an inside edge which just beats the wicket. Third life for this silken cat."

453,"Faulkner to S Dhawan, no run 133 kph, tries to cut away this back of a length delivery behind point but finds the fielder"
454,"Faulkner to S Dhawan, OUT 136 kph, and its all over for Da-One. Looking to improvise a flick behind square on the leg side through fine leg, he ends up stepping out to the off side. Faulkner must have seen this coming as he releases the ball on a middle to leg stump line, which ends up castling the southpaw's wicket. So Dhawan was unable to make this century count for more, but still a fine effort considering the circumstances. Makes that the third century of the match as well."

457,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run 127 kph, length ball which Kohli pushes to long on for a single to get Raina on strike. Can Kohli make it four 50+ scores on the trot?"
458,"McKay to Raina, 1 run 127 kph, McKay going round as he gets this to swing in outside off. Raina left quite a gap there, but is able to work this away to the leg side to get off the mark"
459,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run 129 kph, length ball angling in as Kohli clips it off the pads. Raina backed up too much though as he has to return to the non-strikers, just beating the throw from short mid on. End up running the overthrow anyways"
460,"McKay to Raina, no run 128 kph, length ball angling in on middle as Raina is resolute in defence"
461,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 136 kph, Kohli eases to his 27th ODI half-century with a flick behind square to the fine leg boundary. Jaipur Deja vu anyone?"
462,"Faulkner to Kohli, 2 runs 133 kph, length ball outside off which Kohli drives beautifully on the up to long off"
463,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 117 kph, slower ball and wide as Faulkner needs to find his radar, and quick. Kohli just slices this through the gap between point and cover to find yet another boundary. He is on fire!"

469,"Johnson to Kohli, no run 141 kph, fuller length wide of off stump as Kohli glides this behind point, but is unlucky to find the fielder"

472,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run 148 kph, Kohli able to angle this through midwicket for one"
473,"Johnson to Raina, no run 142 kph, short ball outside off as Raina goes for the pull shot, but is way too early for it, as it ends up carrying to the keeper. Raina looked out of his depth there that's for sure."
474,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run 136 kph, length ball which Kohli pushes to the off side for one"
475,"Faulkner to Raina, 2 runs 134 kph, fuller pitched delivery on middle which Raina lofts over midwicket, and is lucky that the ball falls safely in no mans land"
476,"Faulkner to Raina, 1 run 134 kph, length ball which Raina pushes to mid on. Finch, running in from there, picks it up and throws down the non-strikers, but Raina had dived in safely"
477,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run 137 kph, Kohli able to guide this length ball to the leg side for one"
478,"Faulkner to Raina, FOUR runs 136 kph, Raina able to slap away this length ball on off stump through the gap on the off side for a boundary. Australian bowlers (and batsmen) must be wondering what they will need to score in order to trouble this Indian batting line-up?"

481,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 138 kph, Kohli just dismisses this short length delivery from his presence as he rocks back to pull him through midwicket for a boundary. Kohli looking very dangerous here"
482,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 140 kph, Mitch drops it short and once again Kohli punishes him as he swivels on the back foot to pull this square off a rather 'finish' fine leg to just get to the boundary"
483,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 149 kph, you know what they say, fortune favours the brave. Kohli, going for a slash over the covers, instead gets an outside edge which beats a diving Haddin to the third man boundary for the third consecutive four this over"
484,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run 148 kph, Kohli able to steer this wide delivery outside off behind square to third man for a single"

491,"Watson to Raina, 2 runs 136 kph, Raina gets on one knee to loft this sweetly through the covers, with Moises Henriques (sub) diving just before the rope to drag the ball back just before the boundary. Saved a certain two runs there"
492,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run Johnson keeps it full and wide outside off, Kohli drives it to the left of cover where Finch dives and makes a half stop"
493,"Johnson to Yuvraj, no run 149 kph, this one going down the leg side but Nigel Llong must be in good spirits as he hasn't called the wide"
494,"Johnson to Yuvraj, no run Johnson tests Yuvraj again with a short one, which Yuvraj looks somewhat hassled by as he covers the line"
495,"Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run 144 kph, speared in straight at middle as Dhoni covers the line"
496,"Watson to Dhoni, no run 135 kph, length ball which Dhoni gets behind off without too much difficulty"

506,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run 148 kph, Johnson slips in a shorter one which Dhoni gets back to just in time. Looks like these batsmen are content to see him off his spell"

508,"Faulkner to Dhoni, no run 135 kph, Dhoni gets forward to defend the ball"

520,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 136 kph, Kohli seems to be out doing himself with every new shot as he slaps this short delivery over the covers for four. On 95 now"
521,"Faulkner to Kohli, no run 137 kph, length ball going to the leg side as Kohli covers the line carefully"
522,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 136 kph, he is simply topping himself at each instance. Kohli uses his strong wrists to on drive this fuller length so sweelty, and generate so much power that it dissects the two boundary riders to the midwicket boundary"
523,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 141 kph, take a bow Kohli. Is there a better man when it comes to chasing huge ODI totals? The crowd go bananas as Kohli glides this through third man for the third consecutive boundary of the over to bring up his 17th ODI hundred. Sterling stuff from this Indian batsman"

525,"Faulkner to Dhoni, 2 runs 137 kph, Dhoni able to turn this length ball away to midwicket, with the pair steaming through the first run to turn back and get the second. 15 off the over and just what the doctor ordered as far as India are concerned. Australia look a bit bedraggled on the field now."

It sets off delirious scenes from the Nagpur crowd as they roar in approval to what has been a sublime batting performance from the young turks of Indian cricket."
535,"This has simply been a batsmen's day. When you have 701 runs scored for just the loss of 10 wickets, it is all you need to infer. It began with Shane Watson slamming the Indian bowlers to get the early initiative, with George Bailey adding the cherry on top with his 156 that looked to have batted India out of the game. With 351 to chase, India needed to look back to Jaipur, and how. Beginning with an integral 178-run opening stand between Rohit and Dhawan, with Dhawan going on to register his fo"

537,"Well it's all done and dusted then. After six matches (which included a rain out in Ranchi and an even more rained-out match in Cuttack (which got called off)) the series is levelled at 2-2, with the final match in Bangalore to decide the series. With four centuries in the match, it was certainly a more memorable counter between these two sides. So now its off to Bangalore for the November 2 decider. On behalf of Devashish Fuloria and the scorers, this is Rohan Sharma saying good night, and good"
