0,"4.6;?;Tait to Loye, no run booming full-toss, Loye flings the bat but the outswing deceives him and he under-edges into the slips.;"
1,"McGrath to Loye, no run line and length, as you'd expect. Respectfully defended"
2,"McGrath to Loye, no run same again. No pace, no movement, but just there"
3,"McGrath to Loye, 1 wide flashy flashy! It's that width again, and Loye just can't quite get it right with that shot. But it's too wide"
4,"McGrath to Loye, no run straighter, and left alone"
5,"McGrath to Loye, no run excellent line and length this time, and some big seam movement back towards the stumps. Loye leaves alone with a flourish"
6,"McGrath to Loye, no run thunk! Good grief, down on the sweep, slight top-edge straight into the grille! McGrath looks as non-plussed as a fast bowler should when someone attempts to sweep them"
7,"McGrath to Loye, OUT GOT HIM! McGrath dropped it short, as he was bound to do, and Loye tried to keep things positive by playing the hook. But it was a stroke played with no conviction, and a steepling top-edge ended in the hands of deep square-leg!"
8,"Clark to Bell, 1 run off the mark straight away, but a bit of hesitation there! Tickled to leg but safely home"
9,"Clark to Joyce, no run good length, and defended with a hint of inside-edge"
10,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run clipped off the pads and another stuttering single. These two won't have batted together very often"
11,"Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump and played on the up to cover"
12,"Clark to Bell, no run drawn forward and played coolly into the covers. Solid over"
13,"McGrath to Joyce, no run probing line, just back of a length and angling across the left-hander. Defended off the back foot"
14,"McGrath to Joyce, no run straighter and squared up as Joyce attempts to work to leg"
15,"McGrath to Joyce, no run fizzes past the bat with a bit of cut and good carry"
16,"McGrath to Joyce, no run slightly wider but still in the channel. Left alone"
17,"McGrath to Joyce, no run starts outside leg but nips back to take the thigh pad"
18,"McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs shorter, and that's an excellent swivel-pull to dent McGrath's ego at the end of the over"
19,"Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump once again. No great pace or movement"
20,"Clark to Bell, no run banged in a bit this time, but outside off again and left alone"
21,"Clark to Bell, no run wicket-to-wicket. Turned into the leg-side"
22,"Clark to Bell, no run on the money again. Defended into the covers"
23,"Clark to Bell, no run that one fizzed through! Lots of oohs and aahs, but no real alarms for Bell"
24,"Clark to Bell, 1 run attempted yorker, but easily driven out for a single to mid-on. Bell keeps the strike, which Australia might not mind too much"
25,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide and deservedly timed through the covers. Bell didn't try to hit that too hard, just placed it behind point. Well played"
26,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide again! Strangely erratic from McGrath, and Bell - perhaps astonished to get two such rank balls in succession hits this harder and in the air in front of point!"
27,"McGrath to Bell, no run width but left alone. Sensible batting"
28,"McGrath to Bell, no run shoulders arms again"
29,"McGrath to Bell, no run a bit of a squelch as this one nips back to hit Bell amidships. He's not fussed though. Balls of steel"
30,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run outside off, and nudged down to third man"
31,"Clark to Bell, no run good line and length to resume"
32,"Clark to Bell, FOUR runs lovely strike. Good stride and perfect placement, straight through extra cover"
33,"Clark to Bell, 1 run width, and a measured carve through point"
34,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended into the covers, and a scampered single"
35,"Clark to Bell, no run dropped in a touch short, and this one is defended into the gully"
36,"Clark to Bell, no run bit of a fish outside off stump that time! It bent away from the bat at the last minute, and Bell was tempted. Still, he lives on"
37,"McGrath to Joyce, no run bit of nip again for McGrath - he's liking this track"
38,"McGrath to Joyce, no run again, good carry to the keeper from outside off stump. Joyce plays inside the line, as is his wont"
39,"McGrath to Joyce, no run probing stuff, played with an angled bat into the gully"
40,"McGrath to Joyce, no run tries to turn this to leg, but slightly squared up"
41,"McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs lovely strike. McGrath is serving up far too many four-balls by his own high standards. Width again, and cracked past point for another boundary"
42,"Clark to Bell, no run turned to leg, another loud call stops the single"
43,"Clark to Bell, no run line and length, respectfully defended"
44,"Clark to Bell, 2 runs a fraction short, and Bell swings into a big ambitious pull over midwicket. Goes high, but well in front of the man in the deep. Decent shot"

46,"Clark to Joyce, no run straighter, and defended back down the pitch"
47,"Clark to Joyce, no run pushed into the covers to complete another tidy over"

49,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run fuller, and drawn forward to defend"
50,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 wide strays down the leg side. Another extra"
51,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 run quick single from a nudge into the gully. The shy was way off target though"
52,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run width, and nudged down to third man"
53,"McGrath to Joyce, no run tighter line, just back of a length. Joyce plays inside the line again"
54,"McGrath to Joyce, no run attacking intent - down the pitch to meet McGrath, and a leading edge deflects through point"
55,"Clark to Bell, no run good wheels, Stuey, good wheels. Right in the channel again"
56,"Clark to Bell, 1 run another nudge into the gully, and a near-miss on that quick single. Joyce forgot that Clarke is left-handed in the field, and that might have been out if he had hit!"
57,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run slightly squared up, but safe"
58,"Clark to Bell, 1 run bang! Symonds takes out the leg stump at the non-striker's end, but Bell is home for another single"
59,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended with an angled bat to point. The batsmen rotate the strike again"
60,"Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump, and left alone to finish"
61,"Tait to Joyce, no run good swinging full length. Maybe not as sharp as his first spell, but rapid nonetheless. Nothing has dropped below 90mph yet (144kph)"
62,"Tait to Joyce, no run outside off, driven without much power"
63,"Tait to Joyce, 1 run short and swung into the leg-side. Cleaned up on the square-leg boundary"
64,"Tait to Bell, 3 runs fuller length, and nicely timed down the ground by Bell."
65,"Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs that's a lovely strike from a man who's really starting to flourish now! Gave himself heaps of room by retreating to leg, and thwacked that through the covers. Nick Knight would be proud"
66,"Tait to Joyce, 1 run banged in, swung away. A useful over for England"
67,"Clarke to Joyce, 1 run starts with a gentle leg-stump half-volley. Clipped away"
68,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run paddle-sweep to fine leg. Good measured shot"
69,"Clarke to Joyce, no run clipped to leg"
70,"Clarke to Joyce, no run good flight, calm defence"
71,"Clarke to Joyce, no run drifted across Joyce, and that was a bit of a loose waft. And he knows it"
72,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs strays onto the pads, clipped away"
73,"Tait to Bell, no run driven firmly but fielded in the followthrough by Tait"
74,"Tait to Bell, no run snorter! That was short, quick, straight, and vicious. Bell played it very well to be fair, watching closely and swaying out of line"
75,"Tait to Bell, 5 wide tried to follow up with the yorker, but that was sprayed down leg. Nice idea, poorly executed"
76,"Tait to Bell, 1 run"
77,"Tait to Joyce, no run"
78,"Tait to Joyce, no run fuller but slightly off-line. Joyce can't get it away though"
79,"Clarke to Bell, no run dabbed into the covers, and a scampered single"
80,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run"
81,"Clarke to Joyce, 2 runs flapped out into the deep. Bit of a top-edge"

85,"Bracken to Joyce, no run defended into the covers"

87,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run another quick single into the covers"
88,"Bracken to Bell, 1 run"
89,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run steps across his stumps and turns this to mid-on for another single. Good rotation of the strike"
90,"Bracken to Bell, 2 runs clipped into the deep to complete the over"
91,"Clarke to Joyce, no run turned to midwicket"
92,"Clarke to Joyce, 1 run firm clip to square leg"
93,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run down on one knee, and drilled over square leg. Not quite timed though, and swept up on the boundary's edge"
94,"Clarke to Joyce, no run fuller length, and defended"
95,"Clarke to Joyce, 1 run couple of quick steps down the pitch to pick the gap"
96,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run firmly driven into the covers"
97,"Bracken to Bell, 1 leg bye outside leg, takes the thigh pad, but that's another good quick single. Good communication"
98,"Bracken to Joyce, no run straighter and angled towards off stump. Defended back down the pitch"
99,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run steered calmly to third man to bring up a very fine fifty for Ed Joyce. His second in consecutive matches. Well batted"
100,"Bracken to Bell, 1 run leg-side again, and dabbed to midwicket"
101,"Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs that's a lovely strike. Clip-driven, if you like, through midwicket all along the ground. Just picked up inside the rope"
102,"Bracken to Joyce, no run takes the pad, and that's the over"
103,"Clarke to Bell, 2 runs down on the sweep, and that's a thick inside-edge. Bit streaky, but gets away with it"
104,"Clarke to Bell, 3 runs reverse-sweep - or dab, rather, as he did nothing more than deflect the ball. Found the gap through backward square"
105,"Clarke to Joyce, no run"
106,"Clarke to Joyce, 1 run excellent running between these two. Another dab to third man"
107,"Clarke to Bell, no run leg-sided, misses out with a glance"
108,"Clarke to Bell, no run good ball to finish, line and length and maybe even some spin"
109,"Bracken to Joyce, no run bit loose outside off stump. A dab and a miss"
110,"Bracken to Joyce, no run a swing and a miss to follow up - that was rash. Down the track and a big hoon over cow corner, but hit nothing but air"
111,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run drawn forward with a defensive push, finds the gap"
112,"Bracken to Bell, no run driven back down the ground, and that's quick work from Bracken! He fielded in his followthrough and Bell might have been out if his shy had hit"
113,"Bracken to Bell, 1 run pushed out to point"
114,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run another nudge towards the cordon. Steady stuff"
115,"Symonds to Joyce, FOUR runs sweet strike through extra-cover! That was a gentle loosener, but Joyce cracked it almost one-handed on the up!"
116,"Symonds to Joyce, no run dropped! In the air to his left, and Symonds grabs with his weaker hand. That was a slower delivery, but he should have got it. And he's cross"
117,"Symonds to Joyce, no run deflected behind square"
118,"Symonds to Joyce, no run"
119,"Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs another miss! That was an inside-edge onto the pads, and it bobbled past Gilchrist! Lucky, lucky"

121,"White to Joyce, no run good start, nice flight, nice line"
122,"White to Joyce, 2 leg byes strays onto leg this time"
123,"White to Joyce, no run Joyce plays for non-existent spin, and uncomfortably so"
124,"White to Joyce, no run clipped into the leg-side"
125,"White to Joyce, no run good finish, Joyce leaves alone outside off stump"
126,"Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs shot! Drifts onto the pads, and that's clipped up and over midwicket for another boundary"
127,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run more good scampering brings up the hundred stand. Well played chaps"
128,"Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs played through leg again. Some easy pickings at the moment"
129,"Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs clipped off the pads. Good batting"
130,"Symonds to Joyce, no run better line and length. Defended"
131,"Symonds to Joyce, no run down on the sweep again, and good contact as well. Nine off the over"
132,"White to Joyce, no run Joyce fails to time an attempted swat into the off side"
133,"White to Joyce, 1 run White drifts to leg and Joyce sweeps"
134,"White to Flintoff, 2 runs Flintoff works the ball to square leg, the man is right back and so they run two with some ease"
135,"White to Flintoff, OUT Flintoff back, it hits him high up and the immediate thought was that it might have been going over the top. It pitched in line and was certainly straight ... is this the start of England's wobble?"
136,"White to Strauss, FOUR runs confident start, short and he pulls through midwicket"
137,"White to Strauss, 1 run clipped away into the leg side"
138,"McGrath to Strauss, no run straight, Strauss defends solidly and correctly"
139,"McGrath to Strauss, 1 run banged in, Strauss who was looking to come down the pitch, plays a rather hurried swat-pull, under control and down to long leg"
140,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 run pushed into the leg side ... fielders converge but it's well placed and they can't prevent the single"
141,"McGrath to Strauss, no run into the off side but not timed"
142,"McGrath to Strauss, no run forward, he shapes to play at one leaving him outside off stump but changes his mind at the last moment and pulls out of the shot"
143,"McGrath to Strauss, 1 run cut off the top edge through the slips and Tait gets his body in the line at third man"
144,"White to Strauss, 1 wide very wide outside off stump ... Stevie Wonder would have spotted that one"
145,"White to Strauss, 1 run clipped into space on the leg"
146,"White to Joyce, no run chopped down into the pitch a few oohs as it bobbles close to the stumps"
147,"White to Joyce, 1 run cut into the off side"
148,"White to Strauss, 2 runs too much width and that allows Strauss to cut the ball behind square on the off"
149,"White to Strauss, 1 run driven through the covers to the deep"
150,"White to Joyce, 2 runs steps back and plops it into the off"
151,"Clark to Strauss, no run Strauss back, drops it at his feet and Clark scurries down the track to prevent any thoughts of a single"
152,"Clark to Strauss, 1 run ... and so Clark serves him one on the leg which he whips through midwicket"
153,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run short, pulled but straight into the ground ... net result still a single, as it would have been had he middled it"
154,"Clark to Strauss, 1 run driven to the sweeper"
155,"Clark to Joyce, FOUR runs at last ...Joyce steps down the track and gives himself room to drive on the up over mid-off"
156,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run turned off his hips to midwicket"
157,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run fullish, dug out to midwicket"
158,"Bracken to Strauss, FOUR runs full again, driven with timing and Hayden's dive at wide long-on is to no avail as his dive came too late and he carried the ball over with him"
159,"Bracken to Strauss, no run tighter line and no run there"
160,"Bracken to Strauss, 2 runs Strauss steps to off and works to deep long-on ...good running and when they saw it was Tait in the deep they came back for the second"
161,"Bracken to Strauss, 1 run flicked into the off side this time"
162,"Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs full toss driven at - and through -Symonds at extra cover. Ironic cheers from the crowd as Symonds looks as bewildered as a man whose pocket has just been picked"
163,"Clark to Strauss, no run wide and left alone"
164,"Clark to Strauss, FOUR runs two steps, one to leg, and that is crashed through cover and it races to the rope"
165,"Clark to Strauss, no run pushed to Symonds at extra cover and ironic cheers as he stops it. Symonds scowls ..he certainly is not amused"
166,"Clark to Strauss, 1 run straight, Strauss, again on the walk, bat-pads it and keep running"
167,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run Joyce with < footwork finally has to stretch to squeeze the ball over Glenn McGrath at point ... yes, at point ... and it is well stopped by Tait in the deep"
168,"Clark to Strauss, 1 leg bye pushed into the off side off his pads as Strauss nicks the strike"
169,"Bracken to Strauss, 1 run smacked to mid-on who is two-thirds of the way back"
170,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run driven with real oomph past the bowler and deep mid-off fields well"
171,"Bracken to Strauss, OUT well, not a dismissal you'll see in a Test. Strauss walks right across his stumps and scoops the ball to leg ... it goes straight up and Clark only has to move eight or nine yards at backward square leg to take a sitter"
172,"Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs angled bat and the ball is run to the left of third man, nice placement"
173,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run whipped from middle stump to square leg"
174,"Bracken to Dalrymple, no run defended to mid-off"
175,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run pushed into space, ambled single, you know the drill"
176,"Clark to Dalrymple, 1 run and again, no real pressure on the new man from the fielding side"
177,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run flicked to square leg"
178,"Clark to Dalrymple, 2 runs full toss patted to deep cover where Tait again makes a hash of some simple fielding. If he was trying to work his way out of a trip to the Caribbean he couldn't do a better job than he is today"
179,"Clark to Dalrymple, no run blocked and Clark quick to field it as he dribbles back towards him"
180,"Clark to Dalrymple, 2 runs squirted to third man, a half appeal from Clark but more in frustration than expectation"
181,"Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs superb shot, gives himself room and creams that between midwicket and mid-on"
182,"Tait to Joyce, 1 run less impressive, slashed in the air a couple of yards short of the incoming third man"
183,"Tait to Dalrymple, 1 run Tait follows Dalrymple as he moves to leg, but he still gets it into a gap"

191,"Clark to Dalrymple, 1 run driven down the ground to mid-off"
192,"Clark to Joyce, 1 run dropped into the leg side and another straightforward single to end Clark's spell"
193,"White to Bell, 3 wide loose again. Short, rank and leg-sided. Bell misses with his swing, but so does Gilchrist with his take"
194,"White to Bell, 1 wide loose again. Not good bowling"
195,"White to Bell, 1 run driven down the ground, and that's Bell's fifty - his first against Australia. Well played"

198,"White to Joyce, no run"
199,"White to Joyce, no run tighter now, after those loose early deliveries"
200,"White to Joyce, no run"
201,"McGrath to Bell, OUT and the drinks break brings a breakthrough once again! And it's that old shark McGrath who does the job. It was short, Bell went for a big swing, and Gilchrist steadied himself under a big top-edge"
202,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short again"
203,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run"
204,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run outside off, and Flintoff drives off the back foot into the covers"

206,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run in that corridor of uncertainty again, and dabbed to point"
207,"Tait to Joyce, no run full toss driven at mid-off who fields on the bounce"
208,"Tait to Joyce, OUT banged in, Joyce plays a tired pull which he doesn't get hold of and the ball loops to wide midwicket. A great ovation as he walks off. His innings has given England something to bowl at and also ensured that John Buchanan gets his wish of making sure Australia are in a game at last"
209,"Tait to Dalrymple, no run Dalrymple moves to leg, swishes and misses. That was 93mph (150kph) which is pretty remarkable at this stage with an old ball"
210,"Tait to Dalrymple, 1 run full toss, absolutely hammered to McGrath at sweeper where he makes a good stop"
211,"Tait to Nixon, FOUR runs short, Nixon hooks and gets a top edge over Gilchrist for four"
212,"Tait to Nixon, OUT another one banged in, and this time Nixon plays a really nothing semi-pull shot which lobs to extra cover. A short and certainly not sweet stay."
213,"McGrath to Dalrymple, no run short and Dalrymple swings and misses"
214,"McGrath to Dalrymple, no run short of a length outside off stump, and another swing and miss from Dalrymple"
215,"McGrath to Dalrymple, SIX runs yet again banged in but this time Dalrymple on it quickly and it goes all the way over midwicket ...it only just carries and it's dropped by the spectator leaning over the fence ...Tait's family enclosure?"
216,"McGrath to Dalrymple, 2 runs McGrath responds with a yorker which Dalrymple hammers down the ground"
217,"McGrath to Dalrymple, FOUR runs full toss and smashed wide of midwicket where it evades the desperate dive of White"
218,"McGrath to Dalrymple, 1 run, OUT driven to long-on, the two players get in a real mess over the second and both end up at the bowler's end ... Dalrymple goes but surely Bopara should have sacrificed himself"
219,"White to Joyce, no run Joyce down the track and pads it back"
220,"White to Joyce, no run again pad, and this time a loud appeal as well. Nothing doing there, though"
221,"White to Joyce, 2 runs swept to deep square leg, good tag fielding on the rope from Bracken and Clarke"
222,"White to Joyce, 1 run swept again, straight to the man in the deep so only ever one"
223,"White to Flintoff, no run steps back and punches to mid-on"
224,"White to Flintoff, no run turned straight to Symonds at midwicket"
225,"McGrath to Joyce, no run Joyce back and defends"
226,"McGrath to Joyce, no run steered into the slips and slap bang into the one man there ...he's at third slip"
227,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 run same shot, but this time Joyce finds the gap and ambles a single as third man fields"
228,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run Flintoff cramped as he looks to thwack into the off and he can only push the ball to point"
229,"McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run this time he steps back and finds more room, punching it wide of cover to the man in the deep"
230,"McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short, pulled to deep midwicket"
231,"Tait to Bopara, 1 wide short and wide down the leg side"

236,"Tait to Bopara, 1 run bumbled into the leg side"
237,"Tait to Plunkett, no run Plunkett aims to run the ball through the slips but misses"
238,"McGrath to Bopara, no run full, good ball which Bopara can only dig out"
239,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run full toss which Bopara looks to swing to leg, gets a leading edge and the ball hangs in the air before dropping feet in front of White racing in to mid-off"
240,"McGrath to Plunkett, no run short and Plunkett looks surprised that it was not called wide. He has a point, but as long as the umpires are consistent it doesn't matter"
241,"McGrath to Plunkett, 2 runs driven uppishly to long-off and Bopara runs well to the danger end for a second"
242,"McGrath to Plunkett, FOUR runs overpitched and Plunkett smacks it over wide long-on for a one-bounce four"
243,"McGrath to Plunkett, 1 run yorker, well dug out towards extra cover and a single to end"
244,"Well, at long last we have a game on our hands between Australia and England. Ed Joyce, dropped on 6 by Shaun Tait, made his maiden hundred to help England to 292 for 7 as all the Australian bowlers struggled. The rate needed is 5.86 but the pitch looks good and this should be a very interesting chase. Join us 6.35pm"
245,"Welcome back. Here we go, the huddles are over and we are ready to roll. It'll be Liam Plunkett to take the new ball. Mal Loye will not be taking the field after that blow to the jaw during his innings. Paul Collingwood substitutes."
246,There's an extra catcher at gully
247,Here comes Brad Hodge - his last chance to impress before the World Cup? Probably. What a situation to come into
248,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run signs of swing for Plunkett, though this one is shorter in length and outside off"
249,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run ripper! Late boomeranging movement and that hoops round the edge of the bat. No foot movement there"
250,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run more handy swing, but started wider this time. Feisty first over so far"
251,"Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide too much swing that time, and rightly called wide. But this is encouraging for England"
252,"Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide that's a harsh call. And Nixon behind the stumps mutters his indignation"
253,"Plunkett to Hodge, 1 run first runs off the bat, pushed into the covers"
254,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run good line, shorter in length, Hayden lets it swing by. Excellent first over"

256,"Mahmood to Hodge, 1 wide erratic - started outside off and swung further away"
257,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 wide oops, wide and wider"
258,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run straighter this time. Pushed back down the pitch"
259,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run good discipline"
260,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run"
261,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run good line and length - left alone to finish a successful over"

266,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run sharp pace, nips away late"
267,"Plunkett to Clarke, FOUR runs excellently timed off the legs. Panesar at fine leg can't cut that off and that's Australia's first boundary of the innings"
268,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run drifts onto the legs, and clipped down to fine leg - where the substitute Chris Read fields! Blimey, we'd forgotten he was still here!"
269,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run left alone. Clarke needs to be watchful"
270,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run right back and into line"
271,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run pushed into the covers"
272,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run strays in line again"
273,"Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs and that's gone too fine for Read at fine leg to cut off. Another boundary and Hayden's first"
274,"Plunkett to Clarke, 3 runs that's gone fine as well, and Monty Panesar produces a sprawling fumbled stop at fine leg to cut off the boundary. There's no faulting his effort"
275,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run back of a length but straighter and swinging back in. Left alone"
276,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run good probing stuff. There's some nice trampoline bounce for the seamers outside off stump"
277,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run carbon copy of the last two balls. Plunkett's using his height well, and Hayden leaves alone"
278,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run a bit wider, but still no shot offered"
279,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run less threatening now. Too short and too wide, but Hayden's not tempted"
280,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run decent line and length, but Clarke's not troubled"
281,"Mahmood to Clarke, 2 runs beats the infield with a firm push through the covers"
282,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run shoulders arms once again. Cagey stuff from Australia so far"
283,"Mahmood to Clarke, 3 runs too straight, and angling onto the legs, clipped very firmly to deep midwicket, where Panesar fields just inside the rope"
284,"Mahmood to Hayden, 2 runs and now leg-sided to the left-hander as well. Too short too, and clipped square"
285,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run fuller and wider, Hayden drives but short cover fields well and threatens a shy at the non-striker's end"
286,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run short but straight. Defended into the gully"
287,"Plunkett to Clarke, 1 run too short again. Clarke pushes into the covers and sets off at once. Bell at cover shies underarm but misses"
288,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run outside off stump, and left alone"
289,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run a fraction fuller, but still not tempting the stroke. That glorious first delivery seems a bit distant now"
290,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short again, and helped down to fine leg"
291,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run that's the spot. Fuller, straighter, and swinging late. Clarke is properly beaten"
292,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run outside off again. Left alone again"
293,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run fuller and straighter, Hayden gets everything behind it and pushes out to midwicket"
294,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run floated up to a yorker length, dug out well"
295,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run good discipline. Hayden comes forward and pushes this to cover"
296,"Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs thwack! A couple of steps and whipped through midwicket with a lot of bottom hand. Bounces just inside the rope. Good selective batting"
297,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run looking again, but nothing doing. Defended back down the ground"
298,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run short, and Clarke turns turtle. Nixon gathers high above his head"
299,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run outside off stump, left alone again"
300,"Plunkett to Clarke, 1 leg bye flicked round the corner, and another quick single"
301,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run fuller, and defended into the covers. That's a better length"
302,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 wide strays down leg"
303,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run width, and steered to a tumbling gully"
304,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run fuller and pushed back down the ground"
305,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run"
306,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run on the pads but clipped to midwicket with no great power"
307,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide down the leg-side. These extras are adding up"
308,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run left alone outside off. Better line this time"
309,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run defended out to midwicket"
310,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run driven firmly to mid-off. Ricochets off Mahmood's knee but good old Monty is on hand to clean up"
311,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run ooh, a bit lucky there! A leading edge looped up in the air, but Flintoff couldn't get there in time"
312,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short and outside off, steered into the gully"
313,"Plunkett to Clarke, 1 wide a bit of an appeal there from Nixon, but umpire Harper isn't won over. Another wide!"
314,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run good delivery - fuller and bends round the edge of Clarke's bat. Six of those an over would suit England"
315,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run leading edge again, but safe"
316,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run thick outside edge to gully. Plunkett is struggling a bit with his action, but he's persevering"
317,"Plunkett to Clarke, FOUR runs that one went wrong for Plunkett. Dragged down, wide of off stump, and flailed over point"
318,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run better line and length. Fuller and straighter, and defended"
319,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run outside off and left alone again"
320,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run too much width again, but Hayden doesn't chase it"
321,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run better line. Much tighter to off stump, and Hayden shoulders arms"
322,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run still no shot being offered. Good disciplined line and length"
323,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run left alone again. Lots of dot balls"
324,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run smacked to long-on, stopped inches inside the rope"
325,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run edged into his body, a yes-no moment and then they scurry through"

342,"Plunkett to Symonds, 1 wide"
343,"Plunkett to Symonds, no run"
344,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs on the middle and leg stump line, flicked away to the fine leg fence, easy runs"
345,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run"
346,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs short and wide outside the off stump, Flintoff is clearly struggling here, Hayden picks it up early and cuts it away to the backward point fence"
347,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs four more! another massive cut and the ball screams away to the point fence"
348,"Flintoff to Hayden, 2 runs inside edge onto the pads and they scamper through for a single, Flintoff moves across and tries to kick the ball on to the stumps but misses the traget"
349,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs take that! what and over! again width offered outside the off stump and Hayden smokes it through cover point"
350,"Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs it's raining fours. massive outside edge and the ball races away to the third man fence"

371,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run"
372,"Flintoff to Symonds, FOUR runs"
373,"Flintoff to Symonds, 1 run crikey - this is too exciting. Right, massive apologies for all the nonsense just gone by. We are back up and running. I hope ..."
374,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run and that's Matthew Hayden's fifty. Well batted. Slow at first, but increasingly brutal"
375,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run too much width, and that's carved down to third man"
376,"Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs thumped over point! Gave himself room and threw the kitchen sink at that. A one-bounce four, inches inside the rope"
377,"Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run something's not right about Symonds' bicep. I think he's tweaked it playing that last carve over point"
378,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide short and wild down the leg-side. Symonds flexes some more"
379,"Mahmood to Hayden, OUT there's the breakthrough! And it's that man on the drive who does the trick. Lots of width from Mahmood, Hayden went for a big booming drive and it's a smart reflex take from Jamie Dalrymple at short cover! Not the best ball, but the best result as far as England are concerned"
380,"Mahmood to Hussey, no run full and swinging onto off stump. Squirted to gully"
381,"Mahmood to Hussey, no run Hussey still not off the mark, and that's the end of an important over"

390,"Bopara to Symonds, 1 run"
391,"Bopara to Hussey, 2 leg byes"
392,"Bopara to Hussey, no run"

399,"Bopara to Hussey, 1 run"
400,"Bopara to White, 5 wide bouncer from Bopara, but Nixon was standing up to the stumps ... so he had no chance. Still, White's not wearing a helmet, so he's asking for it really"

402,"Bopara to Hussey, no run tight bowling, a hint of swing"
403,"Bopara to Bracken, no run lovely ball! Hits the seam and fizzes past the edge. A pat of appreciation from Bell"

412,"Bopara to Bracken, no run good line and length again. Defended"

423,"Bopara to White, no run fizzes past the off stump, well bowled again"
424,"Bopara to White, 2 runs hint of outswing, firmly driven through the covers. Plunkett on the boundary makes a meal of his elaborate fielding. Still, it's vastly improved to his efforts last week"

454,"Panesar to Clark, 1 run clipped into the leg-side. Tight bowling again"
455,"Panesar to Bracken, FOUR runs that's too short and wide from Panesar, and that's a firm thud through the covers. Australia haven't given up here"
456,"Panesar to Bracken, no run back on a better line and length. Deadbatted"
457,"Panesar to Bracken, OUT beautiful ball! Tossed right up, much much slower, and Bracken played all round it as the ball crashed into middle and leg. Another one bites the dust, and with Glenn McGrath now at the crease, it's safe to say the game is up. Or is it?"
458,"Flintoff to Clark, no run full length, maybe a touch of reverse swing, dug out to the covers"

485,"Okay, so Australia had their foot off the pedal and their eyes on bigger contests, but it was still a worthy performance nonetheless. It was set up by Ed Joyce's maiden ODI century, and sealed by some tidy bowling from Liam Plunkett in particular."
486,That's it from us today. We've been Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson. Thanks for bearing with us through our technical glitches. Join us then from 0300 GMT on Sunday for the showdown between Australia and New Zealand at Melbourne.
