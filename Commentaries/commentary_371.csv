609,112 meters - that was the length of that last-over six. In Adelaide Oval it's no joke.
610,Here's the presentation:
611,"India beat Australia for the first time at Adelaide and it's their first win against a Clarke-led side on this tour. It's quite ironic looking back at the abuse Dhoni received when he was struggling, to the response now. Abuse to praise in 60 seconds... Here's an example:"
612,"So McKay crumbles under pressure in the final over. With 13 needed, Australia would have fancied their chances but Dhoni quietly saved his best for the last over. It was a strange old knock but in end India got home in a heart-stopper."
613,India won by 4 wickets (with 2 balls remaining)
614,"Player of the match is Gautam Gambhir, INDIA"
