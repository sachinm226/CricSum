Hopefully we have a wonderful game to round off what has been a superb series. Who would've thought we'd get the amount of cricket we have? Rains have stayed away and it's likely to stay that way again tonight"

2,"Starc to Perera, 1 wide Starc's radar is wonky, this time he slides down the leg side, past the flick. Wide"
3,"Starc to Perera, FOUR runs and Kusal sets to work with a crunching drive. Starc spears it too full and outside off, he rocks forward and strokes it to the right of Henriques at extra cover"

He blows a kiss to the crowd as well. #ThankyouDilshan. This was a nothing delivery - short and wide outside off. Dilshan again slashes his hands at a cut.

35,"Faulkner to Perera, OUT Warner tears to his right from mid-on and takes a great diving catch. For a moment, it seemed mid-off would collide with the captain, but Wade probably backed out of the way seeing Warner dash in. This wasn't the cutter, good length on middle, stopped a bit on Kusal.

53,"Zampa to Mendis, no run dropped shorter, pulled straight to Warner at midwicket"
54,"Zampa to Mendis, OUT Zampa roars an appeal for lbw, given by umpire Palliyaguruge. Did the pitch outside leg? Zampa held this back and found a bit of turn to rap the front pad as Mendis missed a sweep. The HawkEye shows that it pitched just outside leg"

56,"Henriques to Dhananjaya, 1 leg bye heading into the pads, deflected behind square"
57,"Henriques to Kapugedera, 2 runs full and too straight in line, he glances it fine, the man in the deep, Starc, is squarer"

77,"Zampa to Perera, no run pushed through on middle, defended back towards the bowler"
78,"Zampa to Perera, OUT Thisara now holes out, SL six down. Short legbreak on top of middle. Thisara takes it on with a pull. He has to settle with a miscue to deep square leg, where Head clings onto it. He exits for a duck"
