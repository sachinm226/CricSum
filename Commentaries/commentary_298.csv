242,Bishen strikes again: In the last 20 years there have been only three instances of Australia scoring fewer runs after batting all 50 overs against Pakistan
243,6.47pm Both captains and Dean Jones had said before the match started that it was a beautiful batting pitch. These 50 overs have showed otherwise and Pakistan also bowled and fielded very well to stifle the batsmen. Warner gave a strong start and it was mainly Smith's 77 that took them beyond 200. Back in half-an-hour for the chase.
