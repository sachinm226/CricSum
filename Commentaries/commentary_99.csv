257,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run sharp again, ducking into the right hander, and pushed to the leg side off the back foot"
258,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, FOUR runs full length, outswing, read early and Bairstow's supreme timing comes to the fore to pierce the covers with quick hands"
259,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run jeepers, how did that miss! Fast and full, and Bairstow was beaten for pace, under-edging a defensive push off the toe of his bat and past the off stump!"
260,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run forward again, this is genuinely brisk from Richardson, skidding low from a low trajectory"
261,"Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run punched off the back foot to mid-off. A very fine first over from the new boy"

277,"Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs too short, too wide. Starc is not getting it right often enough in this spell, and Bairstow batters a cut through point. No swing back into the right-hander, so the wider line is a freebie"

279,"Starc to Bairstow, no run sharp bouncer and that's cracked Bairstow on the side of the grille like a right hook! He's fine, the lid does its job as the ball bobbles into the gully. Actually, it looked like the breastbone on second viewing."

307,"Tye to Bairstow, no run worked into the off side once more"

320,"Tye to Hales, 1 run on the back foot, worked to the leg side"
321,"Tye to Bairstow, FOUR runs too short, too wide, too repetitive from Australia's quicks. Interspersing excellent deliveries with rank long-hops, and England are cruising at the moment"
