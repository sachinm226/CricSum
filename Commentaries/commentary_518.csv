0,"Praveen to Clarke, no run Back of a length on off stump as Clarke covers the line and punches into the covers"
1,"Praveen to Clarke, FOUR runs that shot is a masterpiece in the art of timing. Not full enough to be driven and it does not quite come on to the bat from outside off.

2,"Praveen to Clarke, no run fuller this time and Clarke plays it more watchfully"
3,"Praveen to Clarke, no run full on the stumps and Clarke falls into the off drive, straight to Kohli who is standing on uncharted territory"

19,"Vinay to Clarke, FOUR runs Ashwin makes a mess of it at mid off. Drifts into Clarke's pads and he flicks it wide of mid off, as Ashwin runs across and tumbles. He moved very slowly there and the ball had already scooted past for four"

33,"Vinay to Hussey, 2 runs misfield in the covers by Raina. Hussey drives on the up, and Raina should have stopped that as he tumbled to the right. Lets it go and it is a couple. The weather must be quite oppressive."

47,"Yuvraj to Clarke, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw turned down. Full from Yuvraj, on middle and off as Clarke bounds out of the crease. Hits him on and around off stump as he misses the flick. Was he too far down? Was he outside the line? Leg bye taken towards third man. It landed on leg and was straightening. Might have hit middle and off, or might not have. Clarke was well for"
