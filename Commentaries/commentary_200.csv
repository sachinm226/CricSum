They lost 4 for 39 in the last five overs, despite Bailey's blows. Holder generated extra bounce upfront before Brathwaite and Pollard mixed it up with their assortment of cutters. This pitch may not have"
246,5.12pm Welcome to the chase. Could be an interesting one of West Indies get a good start. This should be a proper test of their ability to build patiently. Out come the players. This ball will reverse swing sharply later. Hazlewood has the ball.

256,"Coulter-Nile to Fletcher, 1 run dropped. Should have been taken. Not good from Khawaja. Fullish on off, may have come back in slightly which was responsible for the ball taking the inside half of Fletcher's bat. Straight to mid-on, low but should have been taken"

268,"Coulter-Nile to Charles, 2 runs lazy drive, full and wide outside off, a bunt past cover. No feet movement at all"
269,"Coulter-Nile to Charles, SIX runs way over fine leg. Six more. What a start this is. Short on off, the ball climbs high enough to take the top edge of Charles's bat. Flies over fine leg"

458,"Coulter-Nile to Samuels, 1 run poor shot but he gets away with it. Clears his front leg, tries to go over mid-off but the ball skews off the outside half and lands in front of sweeper cover"

460,"Coulter-Nile to Samuels, 1 run slapped to deep cover off the back foot"
461,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 5 wide loads of extra runs. Inward movement but this one starts too straight and goes further down leg. Bounces in front of Wade and goes away for five."
462,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, no run full and wide outside off, miscued to mid-on"
463,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, no run full and straight, jags back in but not as much as it was in the previous game. Blocked solidly to mid-on"
464,"Hazlewood to Samuels, 1 run full, wide and hammered. Samuels clears his front foot again and thrashes a cover drive. Sweeper cover scurries across to field"

468,"Hazlewood to Samuels, no run short and wide, Samuels backs away and looks to scythe it away but misses. Or did he? Smith wants to review. He has missed it by a substantial distance. Was a hardly audible sound, which probably prompted Smith's call. But all's well for Samuels because there is no bat"
469,"Hazlewood to Samuels, no run shortish length on off, Samuels laces his cut but finds backward point this time"
470,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, no run full on middle and leg, tails back in and strikes Ramdin in front. Sliding down leg though"
471,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 1 wide this one has started too straight and gone down leg"

476,"Coulter-Nile to Samuels, 1 run back of a length down leg, nurdled to short fine leg for a run. The throw ricochets off Ramdin's pads to the sweeper cover and the crowd go up in raucous amazement that the batsmen aren't considering the overthrow"

478,"Hazlewood to Samuels, no run full and straight, Samuels chops one back to the bowler. Interesting that Samuels is persistently looking to hit through the off side. With this angle, the leg side seems a higher percentage option"

480,"Hazlewood to Samuels, 1 run looks to go straighter this time but that angle helps a squirt off the inside half to long-on"

488,"Marsh to Ramdin, no run full and straight to finish, worked to midwicket"
489,"Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs six. Very risky stroke and he gets away with it. Flight on off, Samuels comes down and miscues his lofted drive off the outside half. It hangs in the air for a while., Head at long-off backtracks and takes the catch but is falling over. He tries to push it back as he falls over but pushes it over the boundary instead"
490,"Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs six more. More flight on off, Samuels runs down and lofts it with the spin, Though he could clear long-ff and he did easily"
491,"Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs make that three in a row. More flight outside off, Samuels steps out and hits it in the same area. Clears long-off again, awesome hitting"
492,"Zampa to Samuels, OUT and he's gone. What is happening? Zampa bowls this flat and quick down leg, Samuels goes back and allows the ball to hit his pad and he goes through for a leg bye. Wade runs across to short square leg, picks up, turns around and throws the stumps down while moving, at the bowler's end. Wow, what an effort from Wadey."
493,"Zampa to Ramdin, no run flat on leg, Ramdin is struck on the pad and there is a massive appeal. Pad before bat, struck him in front of leg but where did that pitch?"

505,"Zampa to Pollard, no run flat on middle and leg, pushed to midwicket"
506,"Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs phew. That is ridiculous. Unbelievable. Nonsense. What?

A 90 degree change in shot direction, still enough muscle behind it."
507,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 1 wide strays down leg for a wide"
508,"Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, FOUR runs whipped past square leg this time and there is no deep fielder so WI inch closer. Looking for that inswinger but too straight again"

510,"Coulter-Nile to Holder, OUT gone. Holder is given. But he opts for the review. Good length delivery outside off, which jags back in again. Holder attempts a big swing and the ball goes through between bat and pad. Looks like he has missed it, but there is a sound. Not sure what it is. Swerves back in and Wade collects well, diving to his left. Not enough evidence"
511,"Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, no run yorker on off, blocked"
512,"Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, no run honing in on that off stump but Brathwaite's bat intervenes. Much better over from NCN"
