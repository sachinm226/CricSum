122,"4pm: Is that a defendable score? Is it a competitive score...? South Africa started so well, Quinton de Kock charging to 43 out of 59-0 in the Powerplay, but then got bogged down as Australia's bowlers adapted. A target of 159 is unlikely to intimidate a line-up as power-packed as Australia's, but that is what they need to seal the series with one to play. Join us again shortly,"
