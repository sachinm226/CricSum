541,New Zealand take a 1-0 series lead and we head to Auckland for game two on Saturday which starts at 1200 local time and 2300 GMT on Friday night.
542,Ross Taylor also picks up the Man of the Match award for his run-a-ball 70 which anchored the chase. Styris will feel a little aggrieved for not picking up the award himself but I'm sure he will take enough from the match as it is.
543,"New Zealand's stand in captain Ross Taylor can't believe the position he is in, when at the start of the day he had no idea he would captain the side. He heaps praise on all of his players, especially Styris. The loss of Oram made it difficult for him rotating his bowlers"
544,Ponting felt his team didn't score enough runs due to the fact that nobody went on to make a big score after making a start. It is the first loss for Australia in their last 13 ODIs and Ponting is disapppointed but well aware they need to bounce back quickly for the match

547,New Zealand win by two wickets with four balls remaining. The pressure was on him towards the death and Styris comes through with a fantastic innings under pressure. Styris was a late inclusion when Daniel Vettori had to pull out with a neck complaint and he has justified

549,"Player of the match is Ross Taylor, NZ"
