302,Andrew Miller will be back soon to start the chase. Can Pakistan run this down? We shall see.
303,"Readers in India, while you wait for Pakistan to come out to bat, fancy having a look at that Warner innings once again? Here are the highlights, on Hotstar."
304,"A comeback to match that of Pakistan took place in men's golf this year, and understandably all eyes at the U.S. Open that starts tomorrow are bound to hone in on Tiger Woods, and his trusted companion Frank. Wait...who's this Frank?"
305,Australia lost 10 for 161 off 28 overs after Aaron Finch and Warner's brilliant opening stand.

307,"Mike Hussey, our Match Day studio analyst, reckons Warner's innings was liking watching the batsman of old ..."
308,"2.27pm Hello again... well, we've got a contest here, in spite of everything. When Aaron Finch and David Warner were in harness, there were visions of 400 flitting through the Australian dressing-room. Instead they've scraped past 300 after a stunning spell from Mohammad Amir. But anything he can do, Mitchell Starc can surely match it ... don't stray far! The chase will be underway any minute now ..."
309,"2.32pm Here come the players. Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq to lead the line in what is ostensibly a daunting target, but is little more than a run-a-ball ... and in this day and age, it's not out of the question, especially for a side that was scoring 340-plus for fun against England recently... (okay, and losing...)"
310,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, (no ball) tight line and length, on the back foot, but an over-step! It's a free hit coming up! In fact, it shouldn't have been called, but too late now..."
311,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run good wheels! Zipping through a wild pull, no contact whatsoever. Justice is done in the end"
312,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run nibbling off the seam, that's a lovely line, beating a cautious back-foot prod"
313,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run wicket-to-wicket line, blocked stoutly on an off-stump line, gathered at midwicket"

321,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run over the wicket, outside off, hitting the seam and climbing through to the keeper as Imam drives uppishly with hard hands"
322,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run huge appeal! Starc goes half a yard fuller, and suddenly that jag off the seam is right up to the edge of the bat. Did it graze through to the keeper? The Aussies decline the review"
323,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run on the back foot, cautiously blocked into the off side"
324,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run through to the keeper on a tight off-stump line. Babar leaves well alone"

340,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run on the back foot, blocked down into the crease"
341,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run outside off, and this one takes off from the deck! Another beauty, but Imam to his credit refuses to be drawn into a nibble as he holds the line of off stump"
342,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs short, slashed, clear of the slips! Short again from Starc, but on a wider line. Imam's reflexive pull takes a fat toe-end and soars over the cordon!"
343,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs too full, too obvious! Imam knew it was coming, the attempted yorker, but with no swing, it was a simple flick through the leg-side from a well-set, well-balanced batsman!"
344,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run outside off, back of a length, and a cautious, judicious leave. No need to chase those!"
345,"Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs full once again, but sliding into the pads, and clipped sweetly through fine leg! All of a sudden, Pakistan are galloping along!"

356,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, 1 run short, pulled, another boundary? Nope, gathered at deep midwicket, and it's a rare single!"

371,"Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, no run back of a length, outside off"
372,"Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, FOUR runs that is a thing of beauty! Babar's timing has been like a jazz drummer today! A stunning on-drive, feet slightly splayed to allow a measured push through the line to whistle to the rope. Gorgeous"
373,"Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, no run through to the keeper outside off stump"
374,"Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, OUT short, and slapped straight to Richardson on the fence! That's a body blow! Babar's drives alone were going to win this game at a canter. But he's lured into a response to the bouncer, and doesn't come close to getting his wrists over the ball. Dragged down from way over his head like an amateur fly-fisherman, and backward square is in business again"
375,"Coulter-Nile to Hafeez, no run outside off, hits the seam and jags. Rides the bounce into the gully"
