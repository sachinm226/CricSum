110,"Chahal to Finch, no run quick and straight, skewed to midwicket. Still nothing full"
111,"Chahal to Finch, FOUR runs he probably anticipated that. Short outside off, Finch sat back and slapped a pull just wide of midwicket. Good batting"

113,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run a full googly that is picked easily and driven to long-off for one"

135,"Hardik to Finch, 2 runs good length outside off, sliced behind point for a couple. The backward point fielder should have done better, just escorted it to the deep fielder. No dive"
136,"Hardik to Finch, no run good stop from Pandya. A three-run over, India will take that. A slower ball outside off, driven back where Pandya dives to his right and saves a run"
137,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run flat on the pads, flicked down to fine leg again for one"
138,"Kuldeep to Finch, FOUR runs a hundred for Finch in his first game back. Sensational batting. The googly down leg, sweeps this hard behind square, keeps it along the ground. A fistpump, not much more"
139,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run flat and straight, defended back"
140,"Kuldeep to Finch, SIX runs the topspinner, full and flighted outside off, Finch gets low and goes weeeeee, right in his wheelhouse and the sweep goes welll over long-on."
141,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run flatter this time, Finch goes back and defends"
142,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run fuller and quicker outside off, driven back to the bowler. I'm definitely jumping the gun but a double-hundred is not out the question"

168,"Kuldeep to Finch, OUT taken at deep midwicket. Finch's belligerence ends. It's full and Finch sees an opportunity to hit it over midwicket, but Finch can't get underneath the length, which means his heave goes straight and flat to Jadhav at deep midwicket, who takes it awkwardly. A white towel falls off, and Finch thinks it's the ball. But has to walk off. Fine innings from Finch, has put Australia in command"

174,"Hardik to Maxwell, 1 run good length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
175,"Hardik to Smith, FOUR runs a thick outside edge for four. A slower ball outside off, Smith plays the line, but the ball takes the outside edge and races away past short third man"

192,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide the slow googly outside off is too wide and is called"
193,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide the seam-up delivery, took everyone by surprise but it's down leg. 90 kmph."
194,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run flat and short outside off, muscled to long-on. Not getting the elevation he wants"
195,"Kuldeep to Smith, OUT easily taken at long-off. It's the googly outside off, Smith wanted to get closer to the ball and hit it straighter but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to Bumrah at long-off. Looking into the sun is Bumrah, but he has his sunglasses on. Kuldeep has been a touch expensive, but has got two big wickets when they're trying to go after him."
196,"Chahal to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell gone now. Two in two for India. Australia losing their way. He shuffled right across, looking to go straight. He came running down but Chahal fires this wide outside off, so wide that Maxwell can't even get close to it. Misses it by a distance and Dhoni's hands are far too quick for Maxwell to consider going back. Chahal has him thrice in this series now, all while Maxwell has tried to take him down. Fantastic defensive bowling from India's spinners"

201,"Chahal to Stoinis, no run short and wide outside off, left alone from Stoinis, wanted a wide. Umpire doesn't think so"
202,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run lots of flight outside off, well outside his hitting arc, driven to long-off for one"
203,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, SIX runs enough muscle behind that to clear long-off. A googly outside off, Stoinis got underneath it and swung cleanly over long-off. He may have read that well"

205,"Kuldeep to Head, no run the googly outside off, Head goes back and punches to point"

211,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide another short wide delivery that is too wide for legality"
212,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, FOUR runs what power from Stoinis. Bhuvneshwar goes straight this time, full around off, drilled past Bhuvi's feet. Long-off didn't have a long way to go but did not have a chance"

214,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run a full slow delivery outside off, Handscomb stays in his crease, trying to go over long-on but no connection"
215,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run another big hoick that Handscomb misses. Full outside off, no bat."
216,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run a slower ball outside off, Stoinis can't get bat on ball. It's another cutter. Stoinis' strike rate now dips below 100"
217,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run good length outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover. Stoinis thinks of two, but Rahane is quick on it. Great bowling, the lengths are so intentionally all over the place that the batsmen can't line 'em up"
218,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run a wide slower delivery outside off, worked away to deep square leg. Just one more"
219,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run fuller than good length around off, punched down to long-off. Another single more"
220,"Bumrah to Handscomb, OUT sensational catching from Pandey. A slower delivery outside off is hit nicely to long-off, it looks like six for the entirety of its trajectory until Pandey gets around to his right, takes a reverse-cupped catch, realises he was stepping over the boundary and threw it back up in the air. Then, he nonchalantly got back in and took the catch, no fuss, no trouble."

222,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, no run a full drifty delivery outside off, may have been the knuckle ball, 124 kph, cut to point"
223,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run shuffled right across, full on off, hit away to midwicket via the pad. It's pad and then bat. Kohli wants to review, not a bad time to do so. Definitely pad first, but impact is just outside the line. So good call from the umpire Shamshuddin"

249,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs good length around off, shovelled past square leg for a couple."
250,"5.06pm What a finish from India. They have done superbly to restrict Australia under 300, they conceded just 59 runs off the last 10 overs after Aaron Finch's sensational hundred and another Steven Smith fifty put them in command of the game. All the bowlers contributed nicely, taking wickets and bowling good defensive lines. Australia's batting came to the fore in the first half of the innings, but then failed miserably in the second half. They have the runs on the board, but is it enough? This total is just 12"
251,"5.43pm Hello, again. Thanks, Nikhil. From 224 for 1, Australia had slumped to 275 for 6. The visitors managed only 38 in their last six overs to finish with a below-par 293 for 6. Will the pitch play better under lights as India's captain Virat Kohli suggested at the toss? India need 294 to wrap up the series. Rohit walks out to bat with Rahane.

433,"Stoinis to Hardik, 1 run shortish and straight, punched to long-on"

458,"Agar to Jadhav, no run flat and wide, sliced to point"
459,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, 1 run short and wide from Richardson, cut away to backward point. The fielder fumbled and Pandya wanted two, but Jadhav said no. I can think of a few batsmen who would have not been happy with that from Jadhav"

461,"Kane Richardson to Pandey, no run on a length on off, 135 kph, bunted back to the bowler"

536,"9.18pm Not many ODI chases have been as clinical and as convincing as that this year. Chasing 294, India got a fine start via fifties from Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, and that was it really. Australia just did not have the depth or personnel to challenge India's strong batting thereon. India did stutter, but they now have nine wins on the bounce, consistency that has earned them the tag of the best team in the world in this format. Australia were well short, 350 may have been a par score but as soon as they"
537,India won by 5 wickets (with 13 balls remaining)
538,"Player of the match is Hardik Pandya, INDIA"
