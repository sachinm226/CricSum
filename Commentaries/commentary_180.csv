0,"Nehra to Khawaja, 1 run swing first up, but Khawaja has middled it just like he has been in the BBL. Gets a single to third man"

2,"Nehra to Watson, no run full and wide, nearly a half-volley, driven to short cover"

4,"Nehra to Watson, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the front foot"
5,"Nehra to Watson, no run slower ball, hits the outside edge of the big Watson wind-up. Just that at the last moment he reduces the bat speed, which means the edge is soft"
6,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 3 runs Khawaja continues to middle everything and continues to place everything. Full outside off, driven between cover and extra cover"

9,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs middled it again. Chest high short ball pulled away for four over square leg"
10,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs he is getting four for this. Oh my word he is getting four for this. I swear this is just tucked away gentle off the pads, but it has beaten square leg inside the circle, and the boundary on that side is really short"
11,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 2 runs another boundary? Tucked away off the pad again, beats short fine leg easily, and Ashwin dives after running to his left from deep square leg. Has he kept it in? Called two so Ashwin has made the save. Well done"
12,"Nehra to Watson, 1 run slower ball, short of a length, runs this down to third man for one"
13,"Nehra to Khawaja, OUT and Khawaja is gone. Lovely delivery from Nehra. Khawaja goes without facing a dot. It's the first time he might have got out for under fifty in a long long time. Nehra gets this length ball to hold its line, Khawaja's defensive push is not the greatest, and the outside edge carries to Dhoni. Just the right ball: not dri"

15,"Nehra to Marsh, 1 run short of a length, outside off, steered to third man for one"

27,"Nehra to Watson, FOUR runs another lovely shot from Watson. Slower ball, short of a length, on off, angling away, and Watson threads the gap between short third man and point with a back cut"
28,"Nehra to Watson, no run on a length, on off, opens the face again, but this time he has placed it straight to the man at point"
29,"Nehra to Watson, no run on a length, driven on the up, but straight to short cover"

40,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run flatter, outside off, steered straight to short third"

46,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run swept away from middle and leg for a single"
47,"Ashwin to Marsh, OUT slower through the air, tempting Marsh, who pays for it. Looks for the big slog sweep, but the ball doesn't quite arrive. He is well early into the shot, and is bowled"
48,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run full, on the pads, watchfully deflected away for a single"
49,"Ashwin to Watson, 2 runs fullish, flattish, on the pads, bunted into the leg side, the bigger boundary, and has played it softly enough to be able to come back for two"

54,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run roundarm again, slower in the air, bunted into the leg side for one"
55,"Jadeja to Watson, no run full and wide, just inside the tram line. Watson leaves it alone. This is almost a yorker length, but Dhoni has collected it clean. Superb take"
56,"Yuvraj to Maxwell, OUT and Yuvraj has found a new bunny after KP. First ball Maxwell looks to will a shot over extra cover, but the thing with Yuvraj is, he gives you no pace to work with. Maxwell gets no power behind this shot, and finds the man at extra cover"
57,"Yuvraj to Head, 2 runs misfielded by Raina at point, it allows them two runs"
58,"Yuvraj to Head, 1 run short and wide, but the ball doesn't come on, and the cut is mistimed for a single"

62,"Hardik to Head, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away to long leg"
63,"Hardik to Watson, FOUR runs short and wide, gentle pace, cut away for four. Watson reaches 50. Australia might need another 50 from him"

69,"Yuvraj to Watson, 2 runs Watson bunts this into the leg side with soft hands and takes the best arm in the team on. Jadeja hares in from deep midwicket and lets in a rocket throw inches away from the stumps. Lovely work by Dhoni too, who doesn't even collect it completely, but just almost deflects it on. Watson in by inches"
70,"Yuvraj to Watson, 1 run flatter, not short enough to be pulled, mis-hits this to deep midwicket for one"
71,"Yuvraj to Head, SIX runs short square boundary on the leg side, and Head has slog-swept a length ball for six over straight midwicket"

73,"Yuvraj to Head, no run short of a length, outside off, and he looks to work this to leg again. To the left it goes, and Yuvraj puts in a dive to keep them to a dot"
74,"Yuvraj to Head, 1 run down the wicket to drive it to long-on for one"
75,"Hardik to Head, 1 run slower ball, full, pitches out leg, Pandya is lucky Head has found short fine leg"
76,"Hardik to Watson, 2 runs Kohli has dropped Watson. Firstly this is a wide ball that Watson has played at, and it is a low full toss, which he has hit in the air towards deep cover. Kohli charges in but charges in too far, and is on the move when it hits him high on the hand and pops out"
77,"Hardik to Watson, FOUR runs another wide full toss, and this time Watson has placed this straight of Kohli at deep cover"
78,"Hardik to Watson, 1 wide too wide, and this Watson doesn't go for it. He will have to rebowl it"
79,"Hardik to Watson, 1 wide another big wide outside off. Perhaps a change of plan?"
80,"Hardik to Watson, no run this time he gets the line right. Just inside the tram line. Watson looks to steer this full ball fine, but is beaten"
81,"Hardik to Watson, FOUR runs this time Watson goes to the short leg boundary. He moves across early, and Pandya looks to bowl closer to the stumps too. Slugs the low full toss away for four"
82,"Hardik to Watson, 2 runs full and wide again, Watson has driven this to the left of Kohli at deep cover, and comes back for an easy second"
83,"Ashwin to Head, 1 run low full toss, dug out for a single into the off side"
84,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 wide big wide outside leg. Beats Watson's sweep"
85,"Ashwin to Watson, 2 runs shimmy down the wicket to work a length ball into the long leg-side boundary. Pandya is a little slow, and Watson takes the second. Dhoni lets him know that he was caught on his heels a little there"
86,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run low full toss outside leg, swept for a single"
87,"Ashwin to Head, 2 runs floats this one wide as he sees him step out. Head chips this over extra cover for a couple"
88,"Ashwin to Head, 1 run short and wide, cut away to deep cover for one. Might have been a wide had he not played"
89,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run quicker ball, pitches outside leg, swept to deep square leg for one"
90,"Jadeja to Watson, 2 runs and Dhoni has missed a run-out. Watson runs the second on the misfield at deep cover. Pandya's throw is by the stumps, Watson is struggling, but Dhoni doesn't even try to collect it cleanly. He thinks he doesn't even time to make a regulation collection and whip the bails. He tries his deflection but it doesn't work"
91,"Jadeja to Watson, SIX runs full toss, and this will do good for Watson. He has launched this over long-on"
92,"Jadeja to Watson, 1 run another full toss, but he has mis-hit it to long-on for one"
93,"Jadeja to Head, 2 runs lovely fielding by Pandya. Saves four runs. Head slogs this towards deep midwicket, Pandya goes as far back as he can, and leaps to catch this overhead, but the momentum is taking him over the boundary so he just drops this back into the field with both his feet in the air and beyond the boundary. Excellent awareness"

100,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run swept away to deep midwicket for one"

102,"Jadeja to Watson, SIX runs low full toss and with a short leg-side boundary for Watson. That is asking to be hit. He has slog-swept this for a six"
103,"Jadeja to Watson, 2 runs flat outside off, punched straight of deep cover for two"
104,"Jadeja to Watson, FOUR runs meanwhile Watson has become the second Australian to score a T20I century. Sweeps this flat delivery into the short leg-side boundary. A stiff effort from Yuvraj at the fence, and Watson has his arms aloft. What an effort leading from the front"
105,"Jadeja to Watson, SIX runs and Watson is threatening du Plessis's record now. Wide half-volley, Watson is on a knee, and crashes this over long-off for another six. This is carnage now"
106,"Jadeja to Watson, 1 run Watson targets the short leg boundary, but Jadeja is too wide, and he toe-ends it to long-on for one"
107,"Jadeja to Head, OUT fires in a yorker at 102ks, and squeezes it under Head's bat to knock the middle stump over. Some solace for Jadeja after he was put on a hiding to nothing bowling to a set Watson with the short leg-side boundary"
108,"Bumrah to Watson, no run lovely yorker, on the crease, dug out straight to extra cover"
109,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run low full toss, but he has bowled to his field. Concedes the single to long-off"
110,"Bumrah to Lynn, FOUR runs too straight as Bumrah goes short of a length, and Lynn has deftly deflected it fine of short fine leg. Good awareness of the field"
111,"Bumrah to Lynn, 1 run low full toss, hit straight to extra cover where Ashwin decides against going for the direct hit, which can get Lynn out"
112,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run lovely bowling from wide on the crease and low into the toes of Watson. They steal one but he has denied Watson a boundary this over"
113,"Bumrah to Lynn, 1 run low full toss into the pads, concedes just the single to deep midwicket"
114,"Nehra to Lynn, 1 run low full toss, hit into his own toe by Lynn. Nehra gets away with it"

122,"Bumrah to Lynn, FOUR runs finally Lynn gets under a low full toss, and drags it to deep midwicket for four to the big leg-side boundary"
123,"Bumrah to Lynn, OUT lovely bowling by Bumrah and a lovely catch by Jadeja. Follows Lynn with a full ball as Lynn back away. Lynn manages to scoop it towards cow corner, but Jadeja makes a lot of ground to his right from deep midwicket and takes this with a dive"
124,"Bumrah to Watson, 2 runs full and straight, Watson fails to get under it, and Dhoni has missed another run-out. Jadeja's throw is really quick, but is slightly full. Dhoni has to be quick to collect and whip the bails off, but he mistimes his collection and is hit on the finger. Looks like he has hurt himself"
125,"Bumrah to Watson, 2 runs full and straight again, Watson has dug this out towards deep square leg. He risks the second, and Pandya fumbles to allow them an easy second"
126,"So some good bowling by India in the last three overs, which have gone for 29, but Australia really plundered in the seven overs before that. Australia scored 88 runs in those seven overs. Watson ends up with the second-highest score in T20 internationals. India need 198 for a clean sweep. This promises to be an exciting chase. We will bring it all"
127,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, no run good Tait seems to have turned. A yorker at middle and off first up. Some swing away too. 144ks only. Dug out by Sharma"
128,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, no run another outswinging yorker, dug out to extra cover. Only 141ks. Concentrating on release more than pace?"

132,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide nudges 150ks, but bowls a leg-side wide at 149ks"
133,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 run nicely bowled and nicely played. This is short of a length, rising towards the chest, and Sharms rises with the bounce to run it down to third man for one"
134,"Tait to S Dhawan, no run wide length ball, Dhawan drills this straight to mid-off, and Sharma turns down the single off the misfield. There was perhaps a single available there"
135,"Boland to Rohit Sharma, 1 run length ball, middle and leg, worked to deep square leg for one"
136,"Boland to S Dhawan, FOUR runs lovely shot. Short of a length, widish, and he goes back to seer it past point to the short off-side boundary"
137,"Boland to S Dhawan, 1 run well done by Head at point. Dhawan square-drives from down the wicket, and Head fields it well despite the awkward bounce"
138,"Boland to Rohit Sharma, no run short of a length, outside off, sort of shanks the attempted back-foot drive"
139,"Boland to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs what a shot. Some premeditation but a graceful shot. Makes room early, gets under a shortish ball and chips it over cover for four"
140,"Boland to Rohit Sharma, 1 run goes for the short leg-side boundary this time, but can't beat deep square leg to his right. Kept down to two"
141,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs short of a length, into the hip, cramping him up, tucked away off the hip for a two. Nicely played"

143,"Tait to Rohit Sharma, 3 runs length ball, into the pads, flicked away for three into the bigger side of the ground"
144,"Tait to S Dhawan, 1 wide another wide down the leg side. Looks to cramp him up with a short ball, but goes too far down leg"
145,"Tait to S Dhawan, FOUR runs wide length ball, driven over mid-off for four. Tait is getting destroyed"
146,"Tait to S Dhawan, SIX runs this is carnage. Gentle length ball on the pads, whipped away for a six"
147,"Tait to S Dhawan, FOUR runs Tait is clueless. He has bowled to the left and he has bowled to the right, and he has conceded runs all over. Short and wide here, and Dhawan loves the square cut over point"
148,"Tait to S Dhawan, 3 runs slower ball, full, driven past cover now. Won't go all the way"
149,"Watson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs oh Dhawan is peppering the short boundaries. Short of a length, enough width on it for Dhawan to run it past point for four"

155,"Boland to Kohli, 1 wide that is unlucky. Short slower offcutter, but it turns too much from outside off to be called a wide down leg"
156,"Boland to Kohli, 1 run and nearly a run-out. Sharma-Kohli misunderstanding goes on. Kohli has dabbed this to short third, but he doesn't instinctively trust his partner's call. He runs late and has to dive to make it in"
157,"Boland to Rohit Sharma, no run this has clearly flicked Sharma's leg down the leg side, but both the Indian batsmen behaving ridiculously. Sharma asks why this is not called a wide, and Kohli asks him if he is kidding him. Clear sound and clear deflection on the replay. Must be wearing great protection if Sharma didn't feel this"

166,"Tye to Kohli, 2 runs short, into the body, with the short leg-side boundary, paddled away past short fine leg for two"
167,"Tye to Kohli, 2 runs Kohli is down the wicket again, and drives this over point for two more. India well on course here"

170,"Boyce to Kohli, no run full, middle and leg, no room, flicked to short midwicket"
171,"Boyce to Kohli, 3 runs pushes forward and then rocks back to punch it between long-off and deep cover. Boland is looking for a relay throw as he dives and fields but Marsh has over-run him so that allows them a third"

209,"Tait to Kohli, 1 run"
210,"Tait to Raina, 1 run"
211,"Tait to Kohli, no run lovely yorker to cramp him up"
212,"Tait to Kohli, 1 run wide length ball driven to deep cover for one"
213,"Tait to Raina, FOUR runs he tries the bouncer but this is not good enough. This is only hip high, and Raina has tucked this fine of fine leg for an easy four"
214,"Tait to Raina, 2 runs this is better from Tait, but Raina has played this superbly. Rising towards the chest, Raina fends with almost no bottom hand, and ends up placing this just outside the 30-yard circle on the leg side. Comes back for an easy second"
215,"Boyce to Kohli, FOUR runs a touch too short, and Kohli spots it early and rocks back pull it in front of deep midwicket for four. Pressure on the bowler already"
216,"Boyce to Kohli, no run down the wicket, gets too close to it, and punches it to extra cover"
217,"Boyce to Kohli, 2 runs nicely bowled, gets it to dip on his toes, but Kohli has managed to place it wide of long-on for two"
218,"Boyce to Kohli, 2 runs that's third straight fifty for Kohli. In the form of his life. Down the wicket to drive this legbreak wide of long-off for two. Acknowledges the crowd all around the dial"
219,"Boyce to Kohli, OUT Kohli is bowled in a roundabout way. Boyce has kept Australia in the contest. This has been a good contest between him and Kohli. Kohli has been charging at Boyce who has still been managing to york him with some dip on his deliveries. This one takes the cue end, hits the pad, ricochets into the stumps"
220,"Boyce to Yuvraj, no run legbreak, outside off, defended by Yuvraj. What an excellent spell from Boyce"
221,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs low full toss, on the pads, played with soft hands towards long-on. Comes back for the second"
222,"Tye to Raina, no run slower ball, nearly a yorker, Raina gets an outside edge, but this time Bancroft is equal to it and dives to his left to save runs here"
223,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs that's an error by Tye, and Raina makes him pay for it. Short of a length, pitched well outside leg, and all he has to do is deflect it fine. He does so"
224,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs beautiful batting. Slower ball, short of a length, and he opens the face in front of off to find the gap between point and short third man. Comes back for two"
225,"Tye to Raina, 1 run down the wicket, takes this on the full, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
226,"Tye to Yuvraj, no run bouncer, tennis-ball bounce, Yuvraj fends at it while looking away from the ball. I hear something as it passes the bat. Bancroft does too, but he is the only one appealing"
227,"Watson to Raina, FOUR runs another boundary early in the over. Watson looks for the slower short ball, and Raina has paddled this from rib high for a four"
228,"Watson to Raina, 1 run low full toss, soft hands from Raina, towards long-on, but Yuvraj can't come back for the second"
229,"Watson to Yuvraj, 1 run short of a length, outside off, dabbed away to point for his first run on the tour"
230,"Watson to Raina, no run yorker, outside off, bounces over the attempted steer, and draws half a shout from Watson for a catch at the wicket. The noise is the bat hitting the ground"
231,"Watson to Raina, 1 wide slower bouncer, Raina doesn't play at it, and it is called wide for height. Fairly so. This is well high"
232,"Watson to Raina, 1 run low full toss, slugged away to deep midwicket for one"
233,"Watson to Yuvraj, no run Yuvraj premeditates. Moves across the stumps to try to pull to the short leg-side boundary. Misses this skiddy shortish ball. Is hit on the pad. Eventually a good over for Australia. Goes for fewer than the asking rate"
234,"Tye to Raina, no run yorker, accurate, perfect. The dot ball takes the asking rate to two a ball"
235,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs short of a length, tucked away off the hip for two. Past square leg it goes"
236,"Tye to Raina, no run full toss, quick full toss, thigh high, Raina looks to open the face and is beaten by the pace"
237,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs Raina innovates by moving across the stumps to play a pick-up on this low full toss. Gets a couple to deep square leg"
238,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs Rain gets lucky now. And how bad is Bancroft feeling about that missed stumping? Raina is done in completely by the slower ball, and Raina edges while looking for the drive over cover. Goes tantalisingly past the flying wicketkeeper, Bancroft"
239,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs Raina puts India ahead with this bit of innovation. Moves across early, gets a length ball on the pads, and deflects it fine of short fine leg for four. Kohli likes it, and jumps out of his seat in the dugout. Under two a ball now. Focus on to Yuvraj"
240,"Watson to Yuvraj, no run Yuvraj's back foot is outside off in the stance. Looking for the short leg-side boundary. Slower bouncer from Watson. Beats Yuvraj's attempt to hook. Looks at the leg umpire. This is touch and go on the wide. Not called. It is really really tight"
241,"Watson to Yuvraj, 1 run Yuvraj is desperate. Needs to get out of the headlights. He walks down, shuffles across, digs out a yorker. Takes the single. Raina on strike"
242,"Watson to Raina, 1 run slower short ball, dragged to long-on for one. Just two off the over so far"
243,"Watson to Yuvraj, no run yorker outside off. Really quick. At 138ks. Beats the outside edge as Yuvraj looks to drive"
244,"Watson to Yuvraj, 2 runs moves across, deep into the crease, flicks this from off to leg, gets a couple between deep square and deep midwicket"
245,"Watson to Yuvraj, 1 run yorker, and what's more, he has given him the single. Yuvraj on strike first ball next over. Oh this is a cruel sport, T20"
246,"Tye to Yuvraj, FOUR runs Yuvraj finds the touch. Length ball, on the pads, Yuvraj loves it. Is this what lets him off the hook? Flicks it over fine leg. Not the best ball Tye has bowled"
247,"Tye to Yuvraj, SIX runs Yuvraj is back. He has done it. Gets another length ball on the pads, and he loves it. Goes over the bigger leg-side fence. Beats deep midwicket for a six"
248,"Tye to Yuvraj, 1 bye Bancroft misses again. Slower offcutter, beats Yuvraj's shot, but Raina steals the bye"
249,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs yorker, on the pads, placed into the leg side for a couple. India on target. Australia need a dot"
250,"Tye to Raina, 2 runs full toss on the pads, and for a moment it seems Raina has hit this for four. Flicks this past the diving square leg. Raina starts to celebrate already, but it doesn't go for four. Did they lose a chance to take the third because he began his celebrations prematurely?"
251,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs Raina can celebrate now. Cool as a cucumber. Yuvraj can sigh in relief. Tye goes short of a length, looks to cramp him up, but Raina makes room to punch this wristily over point for four. Raina punches the air, jumps in the air, Yuvraj lifts him on his shoulder, Raina pats his back. What is Bancroft thinking?"
252,"Surely there are thousands of Twitter jokes about Yuvraj being deleted furiously right now? But boy did he dig himself a hole here? The wheel turned with two gentle length balls at the start of the last over, but to hit them clean out of the crews under such pressure... India have moved from No. 8 at the start of this series to No. 1 after this whi"
253,"That is the end of a hectic Indian tour of Australia. Those bowlers can rest a bit now. Batsmen have got flat pitches and good bats, but they deserve some of the credit for their ruthlessness too. It was good fun bringing it to you. Cricinfo bids goodbye now"
254,India won by 7 wickets
255,"Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS"
