8,"Utseya to Hughes, OUT he's been done by the spin and the sweep doesn't work this time! It was flighted on length just outside off, Hughes swept against the turn and an edge flew back towards slip where Nyumbu took it towards his right. He looked uneasy against the spinners right from the start"

12,"Williams to Bailey, no run right on the middle stump, Bailey leans forward and blocks"
13,"Williams to Bailey, OUT and another, and what a beauty from Williams this time! Bailey stood outside the leg stump and exposed the stumps for the delivery that drifted in with the angle but spun enough to beat the outside edge as Bailey played inside the line off the backfoot. The Zimbabwe spinners are putting their team on top as Bailey looked back in disbelief seeing that ball turn"

29,"Williams to Clarke, no run beats him outside off this time by pitching it on length and with the turn"
30,"Utseya to Maxwell, 1 run fullish outside off, driven towards point where a misfield from Chatara concedes a run"
31,"Utseya to Clarke, 1 run flatter and straighter on leg stump, tucked towards midwicket"

40,"Waller to Maxwell, no run edged and put down! He was beaten outside off as he looked to drive, the edge went off the keeper on the pitch and he jumped forward but couldn't catch it on second attempt"
41,"Waller to Maxwell, OUT knocked him this time, Maxwell also gone! Maxwell also plays inside the line for this ball that pitched outside off and came in, but it didn't come in that much and enough to hit the top of off stump as he looked to push it down the ground by closing the face of the bat"
42,"Nyumbu to Clarke, no run flighted well outside off, cut off the back foot to backward point"
43,"Nyumbu to Clarke, no run gets closer to the ball outside off and blocks it back"
44,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 run pitches it fuller outside off and he sweeps it to deep fine leg"

54,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 run that's a little shorter which allows Clarke to stay back and tickle it behind square leg"
55,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run lovely flight just outside off, Marsh lunges as far forward as he could and looks to flick into midwicket. Struck on the pad, but outside the line"
56,"Nyumbu to Marsh, 1 wide a little too much turn down the leg side and that puts him on the umpire's bad side"
57,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run stays back to a flatter delivery and punches to short cover. Practices the same shot, with that straight bat a couple more times"
58,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run nips down the track but he can't quite get to the pitch. Doesn't mind wearing it on the pad having gone so far down and with short leg behind fine"
59,"Nyumbu to Marsh, FOUR runs mid-off dives over it! That was a gorgeous stroke, especially with the ball turning and bouncing. Didn't over hit it, but he did ensure he was up to the pitch of it so that hitting against the turn wasn't a bother"
60,"Nyumbu to Marsh, 2 runs hammers a sweep fine and is helped by the man at 45 degrees misfielding"
61,"Williams to Clarke, no run slow turn from Williams, Clarke guides it towards point"
62,"Williams to Clarke, no run shuffles back to protect all his stumps and defends a good length ball on off"

65,"Williams to Clarke, no run good stride forward and he kept bat and pad together to defend a flighted ball on off stump"
66,"Williams to Clarke, no run gets back and slaps a shortish delivery to point. Assured footwork from the Australia captain"
67,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run tossed up outside off, Marsh has to make sure he can get to the ball and smother it to midwicket"
68,"Nyumbu to Marsh, 1 run lunges forward and sweeps from outside off stump, lbw out of the picture and he brought his bat down from above to avoid top edges"
69,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 run nip down the track with his lightning feet and whips it to deep square leg from virtually miles outside off stump"
70,"Nyumbu to Marsh, 2 runs swept from outside off again and this time Marsh has managed greater timing on the stroke. Deep square leg has his task cut out, and he does well"
71,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run flighted and drifting away outside off, Marsh eases it towards cover point"
72,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run employs that sweep again, but the ball was a touch quicker. Couldn't adjust his bat swing and was struck on the pads, well outside the line of his stumps"
73,"Waller to Clarke, 2 runs that's poor. Offers up a juicy full toss and Clarke has whipped it away through a diving square leg. The man in the deep though produces a better effort"
74,"Waller to Clarke, no run good flight and the line is outside off, luring Clarke out onto his front foot to block carefully"
75,"Waller to Clarke, no run flatter and still outside off, flicked into midwicket"
76,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run that's a half-tracker and Clarke uses the turn and hammers a pull to deep midwicket. Quick switch onto the back foot after pressing forward"
77,"Waller to Marsh, no run tossed up a little closer to off stump and the angle makes Marsh play a little across the line. Gets struck low on the pad, but the deviation would have taken the ball down"
78,"Waller to Marsh, no run flatter in length, but the line is decent. Marsh though gets in line with it outside off"
79,"Nyumbu to Clarke, no run shuffles across to a good length ball and tucking it into the leg side"
80,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 run another solid sweep shot, with Clarke planting his front foot outside off and rolling his wrists to keep the ball down. Square leg though disappoints"
81,"Nyumbu to Marsh, no run flighted and drifting in on middle, Marsh nudges it towards square leg"
82,"Nyumbu to Marsh, 1 run loses his length and this one drifts a little too straight too, Marsh gets on one-knee and gives some work to deep fine leg"
83,"Nyumbu to Clarke, no run goes down the track and towards the flight of the ball outside off, smothered towards midwicket"
84,"Nyumbu to Clarke, no run holds the length back and seems to pitch it where Clarke doesn't know whether to go forward or back and his guide to third man is beaten. Well bowled, Nyumbu"
85,"Waller to Marsh, 1 run starts with another low full toss and Marsh has drilled it down the ground - right at Clarke. Struck on the ribs to give Brendan Taylor behind the stumps a sheepish little laugh"
86,"Waller to Clarke, no run flighted outside off, Clarke is up to the challenge with a dead bat"
87,"Waller to Clarke, no run tossed up just outside off, Clarke plays with he turn and works to midwicket"
88,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run gets deep in his crease and turns it away behind square leg. Lovely footwork and he has picked the gap well enough for a quick single"
89,"Waller to Marsh, no run this one doesn't turn, rather like the one that got Maxwell. Marsh though has a bigger reach and manages to get an outside edge to short third man"
90,"Waller to Marsh, no run flighted just outside off, Marsh smothers it down the pitch"
91,"Utseya to Clarke, 2 runs jumps down the track and having reached the pitch he has his pick of areas. Goes for deep midwicket and his timing is quite tasteful. Good enough to force Nyumbu to misfield in the deep"
92,"Utseya to Clarke, FOUR runs short ball on middle, Clarke pounces on it. Doesn't bother with timing this time, it was just murdered behind square leg. Sumptuous footwork again"
93,"Utseya to Clarke, 1 run pushed through just outside off, but Clarke plays the length and whips it to deep midwicket"
94,"Utseya to Marsh, no run gives the ball a little more air and that means it grips into the deck and turns quite considerably. Pitched outside off and hit on middle, but that would have slid down though. Terrific ball"
95,"Utseya to Marsh, no run allows the batsman to get on his back foot and tickle a length ball off his pads"
96,"Utseya to Marsh, no run tossed up around the off stump, defended carefeully"
97,"Waller to Clarke, no run shuffles back and across on off stump and bunts a good length ball at his feet"
98,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run deftly sweeps another good length ball just outside off stump to deep fine leg"
99,"Waller to Marsh, no run not quite full enough to draw the batsman forward and Marsh works it away to midwicket, who makes a diving save"
100,"Waller to Marsh, 1 run this time the length affords Marsh a little more time to pick the gap between square leg and midwicket"
101,"Waller to Clarke, 2 runs that's delightful. He saw the line outside off, he saw the length on the shorter side. Almost immediately made room and late cut it fine of short third man"
102,"Waller to Clarke, no run flighted and angled in on off stump, turned to square leg"
103,"Utseya to Marsh, no run gets back to a reasonably fuller ball on middle, was right in front of all three stumps but he managed to tuck it to backwards short leg"
104,"Utseya to Marsh, no run gets down the track, but he doesn't force it. Tapped to the right of the bowler"
105,"Utseya to Marsh, no run"
106,"Utseya to Marsh, 1 wide roaring turn there, pitched around off stump and then veered well past Marsh's flick. Umpire Dar says that's too much"
107,"Utseya to Marsh, 1 run rapped down the ground as it is a touch shorter, and doesn't turn as alarmingly"
108,"Utseya to Clarke, no run"
109,"Utseya to Clarke, 1 run flighted on off stump, Clarke whips it down to long-on"
110,"Tiripano to Clarke, 1 run good length around the off stump, Clarke's straight bat gives long-on a work out"
111,"Tiripano to Marsh, 1 run a little nip in off the deck to put Marsh in some discomfort. Manages to bring the bat down as quick as necessary and whip into the midwicket region"
112,"Tiripano to Clarke, no run fullish but a little too straight, Clarke leans over his front leg and whips to the right of midwicket. Mawoyo dives and refuses the single"
113,"Tiripano to Clarke, 1 run pushed down the ground"
114,"Tiripano to Marsh, OUT not the pitch to be driving throuh the line and Marsh learns it the hard way. He'd refrained from doing that against the spinners but couldn't replicate that with a little more pace on the ball. It was the cross-seamer, pitched full and a shade outside off, stopped on the pitch just enough to skew his timing and short cover makes a smart grab"
115,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run back of a good length on off stump, defended solidly"
116,"Utseya to Clarke, 1 run flighted on middle and off, Clarke uses his feet and flicks to long-on"

119,"Utseya to Haddin, 1 run got him to play forward again, grip and turn for Utseya forced the batsman to play uppishly through the vacant leg slip area"
120,"Utseya to Clarke, no run jumps down the track but doesn't manage to connect the flick, kisses the pad to help him evade a stumping"
121,"Utseya to Clarke, no run dances down again, and is struck on the pads again. Second time that the flick has failed Clarke in succession"
122,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run stays on the back foot to work a good length ball way to square leg"
123,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run fullish on middle stump, might have straightened a touch too. Haddin keeps faith in his defensive blade"
124,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run angled in on middle and leg, Haddin has nudged it to short midwicket"
125,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run fullish on off stump gets a solid forward defensive from Haddin"
126,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run sneaks in a shorter one that has Haddin up on his toes to tap into the turf by his feet"
127,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run invites the drive and Haddin employs a checked one to mid-off"
128,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run loopy delivery just outside off, Clarke takes it on the full and sweeps to deep fine leg. Another over from Waller begins with a full toss. That's Australia's hundred"
129,"Waller to Haddin, 1 run pushed through on middle and leg, Haddin waits on it and whips past short leg"
130,"Waller to Clarke, no run flighted just outside off, Clarke leans forward and works the ball to midwicket"
131,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run reads those short ones quite quickly, shifts his weight back and pulls to deep square leg."
132,"Waller to Haddin, no run flatter ball but the line is the saving grace as Haddin defends on off stump. Looking for the one that skids on, is Waller"
133,"Waller to Haddin, no run a little flighted just outside off, Haddin keeps to his crease and turns to short leg"
134,"Tiripano to Clarke, 1 run think he rolled his fingers down that. Clarke likes the length on it though, shorter and outside off. Guided away to deep third man"
135,"Tiripano to Haddin, 1 run helped off his hips as Tiripano strays short and a touch too straight"
136,"Tiripano to Clarke, 1 run back of a length and angled in at the body, Clarke whips it away to deep square leg to complete a resolute fifty on his comeback from injury"
137,"Tiripano to Haddin, 1 run pushes him back but Haddin uses soft hands to dab the ball into the off side and his partner, dodgy hamstring or not, pinches a single."
138,"Tiripano to Clarke, 1 run tucked away behind square leg as he gets up on his toes to ride the bounce on a shorter ball"
139,"Tiripano to Haddin, no run back of a length on middle and off, Haddin meets it under his eyes"
140,"Waller to Clarke, no run flighted just outside off, Clarke reaches forward to block"
141,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run gets back and acorss on off stump to ride a flatter delivery through to deep square leg"
142,"Waller to Haddin, 1 run that's the straighter one and Haddin could only read it off the pitch, shuffles across to off stump and opens the face. Soft hands help him get off strike"
143,"Waller to Clarke, 1 run lunges forward on his front foot and sweeps strongly to deep square leg"
144,"Waller to Haddin, no run stays back to a good length ball, waits for it to turn and blocks on off stump"
145,"Waller to Haddin, 1 run dropped and he didn't even get a hand on it! Gave the ball a little more air on middle and that lured the big shot. But Waller's not quite turning the ball as much as the other spinners. That fetches a top edge that almost goes straight up. Waller runs after it himself towards the mid-on region but he is too slow. Misjudged it completely and realises he has to dive, but still couldn't make it"
146,"Williams to Haddin, no run tossed up and angled in on off stump, Haddin attempts a forward defensive and sees the ball rip past his outside edge"
147,"Williams to Haddin, no run again! That's impressive turn as he lures Haddin forward, forces him to play and then weaves the flighted ball well past his outside edge"
148,"Williams to Haddin, no run a touch quicker to push Haddin back, a little more bounce takes the outside edge but soft hands ensures it falls short of slip"
149,"Williams to Haddin, no run a little shorter again but Haddin is wary of the turn now and goes back to tap the ball into the off side"
150,"Williams to Haddin, 1 run flighted just outside off, haddin eases it to long-off"
151,"Williams to Clarke, no run backs away and cuts a good length ball towards cover"

153,"Nyumbu to Haddin, 1 run goes back to a good length ball and turns it to the right of short midwicket"
154,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 wide a lot quicker that time, Clarke wanted to use the pace and glance it fine but the turn beats him. Wided by the umpire"
155,"Nyumbu to Clarke, 1 run gets down the track and drills a loopy delivery from outside off to long-on"
156,"Nyumbu to Haddin, no run shortish and pushed through on off stump, turned away to square leg"

158,"Nyumbu to Haddin, no run hits a good length just outside off, Haddin stays back to block to point"
159,"Williams to Clarke, no run even when he bowls quicker, it grips into the pitch and turns quite bit. Clarke was set up for the cut, but a little more turn than he expects flummoxes his timing"
160,"Williams to Clarke, 1 run keeps to his back foot to work the ball against the turn wide of long-on"

165,"Chatara to Clarke, 1 run full and angled in on leg stump, Clarke swipes it to deep square leg and looks quite comfortable doing it"
166,"Chatara to Haddin, 2 runs length ball, but it comes in slower off the deck. Forces Haddin to mistime his slog. Chigumbura at short midwicket attempts to run-out Clarke for backing up too much but to no avail and it becomes overthrows as well"
167,"Chatara to Haddin, FOUR runs that's been threaded through the covers. it was overpitched and Haddin made it worse by making some room and clattering it on the fielder's right"
168,"Chatara to Haddin, no run smacked back at the bowler with the full face, that's been hit quite powerfully. Harsh to call that a drop but Chatare is quite disappointed"
169,"Chatara to Haddin, 1 run backs away again and slaps a good length ball down the ground to long-on"
170,"Chatara to Clarke, 2 runs that's the shorter slower ball, Clarke had loaded up for the pull and has to adjust his bat swing. Single to deep midwicket."

172,"Williams to Haddin, no run goes back again and pushes to cover after the turn"

176,"Williams to Haddin, 1 run makes room and drives the full delivery to long-off"
177,"Chatara to Haddin, 1 run short ball and pulled, that went in the air but fell well short of deep midwicket"

179,"Chatara to Clarke, no run coming in from outside off, pushed on the off side off the front foot"
180,"Chatara to Clarke, 2 runs straight delivery driven down the ground to long-off and they are coming back for the second, which makes it uncomfortable for Clarke's hamstring. He's holding it for a bit now"
181,"Chatara to Clarke, no run goes for a heave for the short ball but it doesn't bounce as much and wasn't too far from the off stump"
182,"Chatara to Clarke, 1 run makes room and tucks the incoming delivery to deep midwicket for one"
183,"Utseya to Clarke, 1 run short and flat, pulled to deep backward square leg and they take only one because of Clarke's injury"
184,"Utseya to Haddin, 1 run another one dropped! It went very high behind the keeper on the leg side after taking the leading edge, Utseya had pitched it up, Chatara ran to his right from short fine leg but spilled it"

190,"Williams to Haddin, no run punched off the back foot after the turn to cover"
191,"Williams to Haddin, 1 run makes room and this one is chipped just over point and cover point, another lucky one for Australia"
192,"Williams to Clarke, no run that's the most casual appeal you'll see for anything! Taylor caught the ball after it turned away from Clarke, who looked to cut, and Williams politely asked the umpire who shrugged his shoulders"

194,"Williams to Clarke, 1 run fuller on middle and leg, slogged to wide long-on for one"

197,"Utseya to Faulkner, OUT wicket falls straightaway! It pitched on length outside off and Faulkner went back to run it around third man but managed a thick outside edge and Nyumbu took a good low catch going down to his right"

201,"Williams to Starc, no run he cuts and gets a bottom edge to the keeper after the bounce, no chance for a run"
202,"Williams to Starc, OUT this time it's gone through! Pitched on length outside off and turned it in, Starc played for a bit of turn in an attempt to push it down but left a wide gap between bat and pad and the ball found that big enough to go through and hit the stumps"

205,"Williams to Cutting, no run slightly fuller and drives it and short cover dives to save it"

232,"Chatara to Haddin, SIX runs pitched up and that's where Haddin wanted it! Gets the middle of the bat and tonks it to the midwicket boundary by coming close to the ball for six! That hit an ad board and the fielder at deep midwicket caught it after that"

237,"Tiripano to Cutting, 1 run, OUT they are asking for the run out, decision has gone upstairs. Cutting drove the full toss down to long-on and came running back for the second, the fielder does well to throw it to the keeper's end but Taylor has not collected it.

They could have been restricted to much lesser after the spinners jolted the top and middle order, and the score was 97 for 5. But an injured Clarke struck a fifty, and Haddin chipped in with a crucial 49 till the last over to take them past 200. Zimbabwe's spinners starred again, although the seamers allowed them to put up"

258,"Starc to Mawoyo, 1 run touch shorter outside off and he guides it late with the angle to third man to get off the mark"
259,"Starc to Raza, no run loud lbw appeal, not given! It pitched right on middle and was swinging in and Raza misjudged it and left it completely, to be hit on the pads but it bounced too much and was probably going down leg"
260,"Starc to Raza, no run pitched around off on length and angles away, close leave from Raza"

267,"Marsh to Mawoyo, 1 run towards the pads again, tucked to deep fine leg for one and that's Mawoyo's highest score of the series"

283,"Starc to Raza, FOUR runs that's how Raza likes to hit them - make room by getting the front leg out of the way and over the infield on the off side. This full delivery is dispatches over mid-off"
284,"Starc to Raza, no run makes room again but this one pitched outside leg and he gets an inside edge onto his pad. Starc continues his one-sided conversation with Raza"
285,"Starc to Raza, 1 wide further down the leg side and this one's a wide"
286,"Starc to Raza, no run right on middle stump, Raza goes back in the crease and defends it towards cover. He wanted the single but was sent back by Mawoyo"
287,"Starc to Raza, no run back of length now, Raza wasn't expecting that and nearly gave a catch to point by playing it early off the back foot. It bounced once before point and this time Starc talks to Raza with a smile"

372,"Maxwell to Masakadza, 5 wide this hits the footmarks on leg stump and turns away further quite sharply. Masakadza simply watches it and his team enjoys five wides"

378,"Lyon to Masakadza, no run looped up outside off and Masakadza reaches for it with a defensive bat and pushes into the covers"

400,"Lyon to Chigumbura, no run forces Lyon to pull his length back and that changes the batsman's plans as well. Settles into a defensive push, but the turn beats the inside edge to hit him on the pads. Too much turn for the leg before appeal"
401,"Lyon to Chigumbura, FOUR runs jumps down again and lifts the tossed up delivery over long-on. Surveys it with a bit of disdain"
402,"Lyon to Chigumbura, 2 byes how did that miss! Haddin can't believe it either and it ends up two byes! That nearly shaved off stump as he went back, thinking the ball was short enough to cut.
