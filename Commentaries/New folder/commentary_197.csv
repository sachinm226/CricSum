0,"Holder to Finch, FOUR runs drawn forward, but can only get a thick edge. Doesn't matter though as it races past the vacant slip cordon. Third man was too square. Finch jabbed at that, but is lucky this time"
1,"Holder to Finch, no run hint of extra bounce from length area outside off, bunted to point"
2,"Holder to Finch, no run defended to the left of Holder, wants the single thinking he'd hit it to mid-off but quickly realised that wasn't the case"

4,"Holder to Finch, no run floats it full on off stump, Finch gets a good stride forward and then offers a dead bat to defend"

14,"Pollard to Finch, OUT KP strikes in his first over and nearly does a Tahir, again. He looks towards the stands, perhaps, and does the finger-on-the-lip celebration. The lack of pace does Finch in. Back of a length incutter, comes in from outside off at 115ks, Finch aims to force it from there. This means that he drags a catch to Samuels at deep midwicket"

60,"Benn to Bailey, no run turn and bounce! Skirts past the outside edge of the groping bat. Drifts in on off and turns away late, Bailey had to play at it. He is beaten emphatically. This should encourage Benn, as well as Zampa. Ramdin takes it just below his chest"

85,"Brathwaite to Bailey, OUT got him! Bailey was just starting to tick over, but the slightest of mistakes has cost him. Brathwaite bowls an incoming length ball which Bailey looks to run it down to third man, but there wasn't much room to work with as he ends up chopping it back onto the stumps. The squeeze was on, you got the feeling that Bailey was getting a little edgy to score after a string of dots early on in his innings, but that isn't to be to"

96,"Benn to Marsh, 1 run gets a leading edge that rolls towards mid-off"

102,"Brathwaite to Marsh, 1 run dabbed with soft hands towards point, but he really had to scamper through to complete the run as he was pushed onto the backfoot, which meant he had an extra yard or two to make up. No damage done in the end as there was no direct hit"

108,"Benn to Marsh, 1 run slow turn from outside off, crunched to deep cover"
109,"Gabriel to Marsh, FOUR runs width on offer, he gets on top of the bounce and cuts it behind point. No chance for third man. Not an auspicious start from Gabriel"
110,"Gabriel to Marsh, no run hits the deck hard and gets some lift, Marsh is well inside the crease as he bunts it to the off side"
111,"Gabriel to Marsh, 1 wide width on offer, Marsh shapes to play a square drive but can't reach the delivery, easy call for the umpire"

113,"Gabriel to Smith, FOUR runs too full, in the slot for Smith to lean forward, open the bat face and slice that into the gap behind point. Sweeper cover fielder Johnson Charles tried hard, but couldn't get across in time. Such was the timing on the stroke."

117,"Benn to Smith, 1 run chops it between cover and point for a quick single"
118,"Benn to Marsh, FOUR runs not all that short, but Marsh still manages to find the gap behind point. Quality stroke. There was just a hint of width, and Marsh converted an inch into an acre. Played it really late and picked the gap to perfection"

120,"Benn to Marsh, no run gets half-forward to ease that quicker one to the off side"

122,"Gabriel to Marsh, 1 run plants his frontfoot forward and eases that on the up to deep cover"
123,"Gabriel to Smith, OUT Christmas has come early for Gabriel after what was a horror spell until now. Rang long hop this one - too short - and Smith tries to fetch the pull from outside off when he could have easily looked to cut that behind point, gets a top edge and Marlon Samuels gleefully accepts the dolly at midwicket. Smith knew he was dead the moment he hit that. A hint of extra bounce on this surface also played its part."
124,"Gabriel to Maxwell, no run this one's nice and full outside off, watched through to the keeper"
125,"Gabriel to Maxwell, no run flew off an open blade to point, good work there"
126,"Gabriel to Maxwell, FOUR runs edged, but safe! Doesn't carry to Ramdin, who spontaneously moved to his left. The ball was dying on him though as it races away off the deflection into the third man boundary. Can't blame Ramdin there. Maxwell looked to run that down a lot squarer. Lucky break"
127,"Gabriel to Maxwell, OUT another one bites the dust. Gabriel didn't celebrate Smith's wicket, but that isn't the case now as he roars in delight. This one's an incoming length ball that nips back in a touch from the off stump, Maxwell misses the line completely and is struck plumb in front of leg stump Possibly a big moment in the match!"

162,"Benn to Marsh, OUT Chopped on! The bails are sent flying. Having gone wicketless on Friday, Benn nips out Marsh. Pushed through quicker, 90.4ks, and turns away from the right hander. He has a lazy waft away from the body after stepping back and chops it onto the stumps via an inside edge. The WI fans are dancing and grooving in the stands"
163,"Benn to Starc, no run Benn greets Starc with a yorker, he drops his bat down in time and survives"

197,"Holder to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle, Wade uses his wrists and manipulates it towards the short midwicket region. A clean grab and a throw from Holder could have had Wadea"

205,"Narine to Starc, no run mistimes a cut again, straight to point"
206,"Narine to Starc, OUT first wicket for Narine, he has his revenge this time. Nothing wrong with the legality of the delivery. He tosses it up generously, the ball spins away sharply and beats Starc's wild swing. In trying to slog again, Starc was outside the crease as Ramdin collected the ball cleanly and whipped the bails off in a jiffy, with the backfoot a good couple of yards out."
207,"Narine to Coulter-Nile, 3 runs cleverly done! Gets back into the crease, opens the bat face and plays it really late, past short third man. Super touch, super timing"
208,"Narine to Wade, 1 run drifts into middle, driven down to long-on. End of Narine's spell"
209,"Holder to Wade, 1 wide too full, but well down leg. Wade misses a faint tickle, Holder will have to bowl that one again"
210,"Holder to Wade, FOUR runs pulled well, that's a top shot! Gets on top of the bounce and helps it behind deep backward square. Bisected the gap to perfection"
211,"Holder to Wade, no run cuts, but straight to short third man. A metre on either side and it was four"

214,"Holder to Wade, 1 run goes for a full-blooded drive, gets a thick inside-edge that rolls to long-off, called for two but that was clearly a case of sheer optimism"
215,"Holder to Coulter-Nile, 1 run full toss on the pads, worked behind square on the leg side, they thought about the second briefly before giving up the idea"
216,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, 1 run angles a slower one into the pads from wide of the crease, he chips it over the infield to the man coming in from deep midwicket"
217,"Pollard to Wade, 1 run slower one again, slapped to Charles at long-off"
218,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs easy pickings for NCN! Fine leg and third man were up, which meant Pollard couldn't really drift too much on either side. This one's a juicy half-volley on the pads, which he clips past short fine leg"
219,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, 1 run How did Ramdin miss the stumps from a couple of yards? I really don't know. Coulter-Nile squeezes a yorker behind the stumps and takes off, Ramdin does the difficult job of running in and then picks the ball up with one hand and fires an underarm throw which misses the stumps by a long way. The batsman was nowhere in the picture"
220,"Pollard to Wade, 1 wide floats the slower ball down leg, easy call"
221,"Pollard to Wade, 1 run works it back past the bowler to mid-off"
222,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs catching opportunity, but no one takes it. He looked to swing, got it high in the air but the ball fell in no man's land even as two fielders came running in from the leg side boundary - one from deep midwicket and another from deep square leg"

225,"Holder to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs makes some room to swing over midwicket, gets a thick inside edge towards deep square, aggressive running gives them the second"
226,"Holder to Coulter-Nile, no run backs away to carve one over point, but Holder did well by bowling it full and wide outside off, NCN could only watch it through to the keeper in the end"
227,"Holder to Coulter-Nile, OUT swung in the air, this goes miles in the air, Bravo settles underneath that at mid-on and takes the skier without much fuss. Coulter-Nile went across the line even as the bat face turned in his hand, which meant there wasn't much power generated behind the stroke. Easy as they come for Bravo"
228,"Holder to Wade, no run drives, but gets it high on the bat, stopped by cover"
229,"Pollard to Zampa, 1 run slow off-cutter that has been bunted wide of point to bring Wade back on strike"
230,"Pollard to Wade, 1 run swung across the line, doesn't time it well, long-on comes in to cut that off"
231,"Pollard to Zampa, 1 run into the blockhole from wide of the crease, Zampa squeezes it wide of point for another quick single"
232,"Pollard to Wade, SIX runs clean strike, what a beauty! This one was full and angling across, Wade swung across the line and saw that sail over long-on. Boom!"
233,"Pollard to Wade, 1 run drills one down to long-on, wanted the second but he hit it too well"
234,"Pollard to Zampa, no run beaten by the slower one. Cany variations again, rolls his fingers over the ball and lands it just around off stump, Zampa was through with the stroke even before the ball arrived and missed. Not far away from the stumps"
235,"Holder to Wade, 1 wide terrible delivery, high full toss but well outside off. Wade can't reach"
236,"Holder to Wade, SIX runs wow, he's hit that superbly. This one was full and angling across, Wade once again went cross-batted across the line, and Wade used his bottom hand to swing across the line and hammer it over deep midwicket"
237,"Holder to Wade, 1 run driven to the man at the edge of the circle at cover, gem of an innings from Wade under the circumstances"
238,"Holder to Zampa, no run dabbed back to the bowler, some lift off the deck from the length area on off stump on that occasion"
239,"Holder to Zampa, 2 runs clean strike over cover, but there's a sweeper circling around the ropes to keep it down to just two"

243,"Brathwaite to Wade, 2 runs down on one knee as he makes room and crashes it into the gap between long off and deep cover, super knock this. 8th ODI fifty"
244,"Brathwaite to Wade, no run too full and well outside off, umpire Joe Wilson thinks it was well inside the wide line. Wade isn't impressed. Poor decision"
245,"Brathwaite to Wade, OUT swung across the line, Wade gets a thick inside edge to Brathwaite's left. Zampa took off for the run without realising the bowler moved to his left. Then it was a battle between the two, and Brathwaite runs all the way to the stumps to remove the bails at the non-striker's end. Zampa was a couple of yards short of the crease"
246,"Brathwaite to Wade, no run swing and a miss. Looked to drag the slog from well outside off towards cow corner. Excellent call by the umpire this time"
247,"Brathwaite to Wade, SIX runs what a hit to finish the innings. Too full, he gets down on one knee, gets underneath the ball and swings that across the line over wide long-on. Super hit!"
248,"4.40pm What a time for Matthew Wade to come up with a telling contribution. He was faced with a crunch situation when Shannon Gabriel dismissed Steven Smith and Glenn Maxwell in the same over, but has he steered Australia out of trouble or what? More importantly, he added 40 more after being given a reprieve when Denesh Ramdin missed the easiest of run-outs - an underarm flick at the striker's end from no more than two yards away. 270 is an excellent total"
249,"5.10pm Welcome back, folks. We aren't far away from a resumption. West Indies' top order has struggled. The last time these two sides played, it was Denesh Ramdin and Marlon Samuels who bailed them out. Can they get a better start from the openers tonight? They will have their task cut out against Mitchell Starc first up"

252,"Starc to Fletcher, 2 runs loaded with risk, but he's off the mark. The ball swerves back in to take a thick inside edge that flies past square leg. Had he missed it, he would have been walking back to the dressing room"

254,"Starc to Fletcher, no run floats it full and across Fletcher who pats it back down the pitch"

258,"Hazlewood to Charles, no run too straight, flicked to square leg"
259,"Hazlewood to Charles, FOUR runs slashes, and gets the boundary. There was width, Charles ensured there were no half measures and sliced it over backward point. Third man had no chance"
260,"Hazlewood to Charles, 2 runs on middle and leg, he hops back and helps it down to fine leg, where Khawaja effects a tumbling stop"
261,"Hazlewood to Charles, no run floats it full and around off stump, Charles is caught in two minds, lets it go in the end"
262,"Hazlewood to Charles, 1 run again on the pads, eased to long leg, easily done"
263,"Starc to Charles, 2 runs Zampa at square leg took the pace off that flick shot, Starc was too full and drifting into the pads, neat flick from Charles"
264,"Starc to Charles, 1 wide floats it full and well outside off, another wide. Starc is looking to cause confusion in the batsman's mind perhaps by floating one across after getting a couple of deliveries in"
265,"Starc to Charles, no run crisp drive, but Bailey dives to his right to stop that at cover point"
266,"Starc to Charles, 1 run just eludes the outstretched hands of Smith at second slip. Can't call it a chance really. This was full, Charles went after that one, but the ball kept going away from the skipper. Third man stops it. Can't call it a chance"
267,"Starc to Fletcher, no run angled full and across the batsman, who watches it go"
268,"Starc to Fletcher, no run beaten on the drive. Minimal feet movement as he shapes to play the cover drive. Starc has a few words for Fletcher"

277,"Starc to Fletcher, 1 wide full but well outside off, exercise for the umpire"
278,"Starc to Fletcher, no run hops back and bunts it gently to point"
279,"Starc to Fletcher, no run appeal for lbw. This one bends back in a shade to hit Fletcher on the pad. Was there an inside edge? Yes, clearly. Steven Smith got that right too as he prevented Starc from going for a review"

281,"Starc to Fletcher, 1 run driven wide of cover for an easy single"

390,"Zampa to Ramdin, FOUR runs edged and the ball flies into the third man boundary. Too short, Ramdin shapes to cut and gets a thick edge. Really, that's the only way a boundary was coming at the moment"

405,"Zampa to Pollard, no run quicker one on middle and leg, defended to the leg side"
