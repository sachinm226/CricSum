0,"Mohammad Nabi has won the toss and Afghanistan will bowl. He says there is moisture in the pitch, which they want to use. Usman Ghani is back in the XI ahead of Gulbadin Naib. Australia have made two changes as expected: Hazelwood in for Cummins and Faulkner in for Watson"
1,"Zadran to Warner, no run length ball outside off, angling away, left alone"
2,"Zadran to Warner, no run short of a length, stops a touch, pushed in front of square"
3,"Zadran to Warner, no run looks for the pull from outside off, but it is not short enough, and the bottom half of the bat sends it to mid-on"
4,"Zadran to Warner, no run fuller, shaping in, defended to mid-off. That's the length he needs to bowl"
5,"Zadran to Warner, 1 run top edge on the swivel-pull, but it doesn't carry to fine leg"
6,"Zadran to Finch, 1 wide wide down the leg side. Just maybe got used to bowling to the left-hand batsman"
7,"Zadran to Finch, 2 runs full and swinging away, driven wide of mid-off where Hassan makes a half stop. Should have done better really. Concedes an extra run"
8,"Shapoor to Warner, FOUR runs short, not much sting behind it, chest high for Warner and he pulls him away for four. Early lesson for Shapoor to not get carried away with the WACA bounce"
9,"Shapoor to Warner, 1 run short of a length, into the body, tucked away off the hip"
10,"Shapoor to Finch, 1 run on a good length, slight seam away from around off, defended from the crease"
11,"Shapoor to Warner, 2 runs inside edge. Good length ball, seams in a touch, takes the inside edge, goes fine of the square fine leg. Dawlat Z fields this with the foot"
12,"Shapoor to Warner, 1 leg bye short of a length, into the body, kisses the thigh pad on the way through, and Afsar makes a good save down the leg side"
13,"Shapoor to Finch, 1 run wide length ball, Finch drives hard at it, gets a thick edge that flies by point"
14,"Zadran to Finch, no run on a length, just outside off, swings away a touch, defended to mid-on"
15,"Zadran to Finch, no run another outswinger, just outside off, defended off the outer half of the bat"
16,"Zadran to Finch, no run on a length, outside off, straightens a touch, defended again"
17,"Zadran to Finch, no run fuller, almost a half-volley, driven down the ground, Dawlat puts the dive in to prevent any runs"
18,"Zadran to Finch, no run wider on the crease, and bowls an inswinger. Shaping in towards the middle of the off stump. Defended back to him"
19,"Zadran to Finch, OUT beautiful over. Perfect seam and swing bowling. A few outswingers, then inswinger from wide on the crease, and ends up with a sucker punch of an outswinger. Full, just outside off, Finch thinks he can drive at it, but it is not quite as full as he expects. Which means there is time for the ball to move and take the edge through to fi"
20,"Shapoor to Warner, 1 wide gets the length right by bowling full, but concedes a wide down leg"
21,"Shapoor to Warner, no run on a length, angling in towards top of off, defended from the crease"
22,"Shapoor to Warner, no run appeal for a strangle down the leg side. Full, angling down leg, there is a sound as it passes the batsman, there is a deflection too, but just the fact that it has died through to the keeper suggests it has gone off the pad and not the bat. Replays confirm the suspicion"
23,"Shapoor to Warner, FOUR runs don't bowl short, SZ. Warner pulls this over midwicket for four. And a soft short ball. Not a mean bouncer"
24,"Shapoor to Warner, no run full this time, but too straight, and has been defended to mid-on"
25,"Shapoor to Warner, no run full, really full, Warner plays from the crease, waiting for the short ball. Defends in front of his body. To mid-off"

29,"Zadran to Smith, 1 run full outswinger, he moves across to push this wide of mid-off for one"
30,"Zadran to Warner, no run nearly a wicket. Sharpish pace, a length ball, angling away, beats Warner's attempt to punch this through cover. Beats him for pace with the skid-through bounce"
31,"Zadran to Warner, no run nearly again. This time the sucker delivery. Floated outside off, slight swing away. No feet from Warner as he drives. Beaten"
32,"Zadran to Warner, 3 runs outswinger, but too straight, and clipped away off the toes for three"

36,"Shapoor to Warner, 1 run full, into the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for a single"
37,"Shapoor to Smith, no run leading edge as Smith goes across the stumps to work to leg. It rolls along the ground to cover"

39,"Zadran to Warner, no run full and wide. Just inside the tram line. Warner goes after it, and is beaten. No feet"
40,"Zadran to Warner, no run more accurate, gets some shape back in to the left-hand batsman. Squares Warner up in defence"
41,"Zadran to Warner, 3 runs this time he gets a shortish length with a hint of width, and he has punched this past point for three"
42,"Zadran to Smith, 3 runs short of a length, on around middle, but for Smith that means leg because he moves across. He has worked this around the corner and timed it superbly for three"
43,"Zadran to Warner, no run full and outside off, pushed away from the body. Not in control as he pushes this to cover"
44,"Zadran to Warner, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended to cover"
45,"Hamid to Smith, 1 wide full outswinger but starts a touch too wide, and is called too"
46,"Hamid to Smith, 2 runs moves across to pick this leg-stump delivery off the toes for a couple"
47,"Hamid to Smith, no run cuts him in two. Short of a length, seams back in to pass between the bat and the body of the shuffling Smith. Shout for a catch off the inside edge but more in optimism than conviction"
48,"Hamid to Smith, 1 run fuller, outside off, he moves across to push this wide of cover for one"
49,"Hamid to Warner, 3 runs full, really full, provides him the width too, driven wide of point for three"

51,"Hamid to Warner, 3 runs short of a length, outside off, punched between cover and extra cover, and they run well to complete three"
52,"Zadran to Warner, FOUR runs oh that is crisp. Wide length ball, and he has absolutely crunched this in front of cover with a merciless drive"
53,"Zadran to Warner, 1 wide wide length ball, beats his edge, and is unfairly wided. That is nowhere near the tram line. A much wider ball was allowed to go through by Dharmasena. Ordinary umpiring. If these are wided, we might never see the end of this innings"
54,"Zadran to Warner, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched away, but straight to cover"
55,"Zadran to Warner, 2 runs pulls from outside off, not short enough, hence this aerial stroke through mid-on. Lucky he has hit this straight of that man at mid-on"
56,"Zadran to Warner, 2 runs bouncer, higher than the chest, pulled in front of square"
57,"Zadran to Warner, no run wide length ball, eases into a drive, but straight to cover"
58,"Zadran to Warner, FOUR runs short, shouldn't be bowling that at his pace. Gets only waist high. That's meat and drink for Warner. Four through wide long-on"
59,"Hamid to Smith, 1 run full and straight, dug out off the toes for one"
60,"Hamid to Warner, FOUR runs shouldn't be bowling so short to Warner. And it is waist high again. Gets inside the delivery and pulls it over square leg"
61,"Hamid to Warner, FOUR runs wide length ball, and Warner is laying into these now. Lofts this over mid-off. Totally crunches this"
62,"Hamid to Warner, no run fuller and straighter, pushes this to mid-off"
63,"Hamid to Warner, FOUR runs slower ball, Warner has adjusted superbly and lofted this full ball back over Hamid's head. This is very good batting. How will Afghanistan react to this barrage?"
64,"Hamid to Warner, 1 run short of a length, just outside off, pushed towards long-off for a single that brings up his fifty. If he bats 50 overs, some records might fall"

71,"Hamid to Smith, 1 run moves across to take this length ball from off and middle, and works this to square leg for one"
72,"Hamid to Warner, FOUR runs short again, this is chest high, but Warner has still pulled this well. More difficult to control than the earlier freebies he has got, but he has managed to roll his wrists and keep this down. Gets four through midwicket"
73,"Hamid to Warner, 1 run short-arm pull to square leg for one"
74,"Hamid to Smith, 1 leg bye moves across again, misses one on off, but the bounce is carrying it over when it hits the pad"

106,"Samiullah Shinwari to Warner, no run flighted on off, drilled down the ground, but straight to mid-off"

153,"Samiullah Shinwari to Warner, 1 run flighted legbreak, Warner looks to open up to play to cover, the ball turns, takes the inside edge, but Warner brings up the 100 nonetheless.

179,"Zadran to Smith, 2 runs full, into the pads, clipped away for two"
180,"Zadran to Smith, FOUR runs lovely on drive. On a length, middle and leg, he just meets it with a straight face, to beat mid-on to his left"
181,"Zadran to Smith, 1 run full, on the pads, clipped away"

183,"Zadran to Warner, SIX runs low full toss, and he has drilled this over long-on for another six. Warner is looking very dangerous here"

191,"Shapoor to Warner, SIX runs Warner has made up his mind. Anything with pace on it has to go. Half-volley to start off a new spell, Warner clears the front leg and lofts this over long-on for a six. A good crowd catch, followed by giving it some shine by rubbing it on his groin"
192,"Shapoor to Warner, SIX runs Warner has hit a flat six over deep midwicket. Don't bowl short to him. He is going to murder them. And he has hit a kid on the forearm in the crowd. Poor behaviour around the kid. The adult with him is on the phone and the men around him are diving in front of him to catch the ball. Poor kid is blindsighted"

203,"Zadran to Maxwell, FOUR runs low full toss, he has mis-hit it, but mid-off is up and he has cleared him with ease"
204,"Zadran to Maxwell, OUT there won't be a fastest WC hundred here. Maxwell yet to score an ODI hundred. Slower ball, half-volley, draws a sort of a mis-hit, and he ends up offering a catch to extra cover. Another excellent innings by Maxwell at the WACA, but still not a hundred for him"

206,"Zadran to Marsh, 1 run slower ball, short, pulled away to deep square leg"

213,"M Nabi to Warner, 1 wide fires in a wide down the leg side. That's the fear of Warner"
214,"M Nabi to Warner, FOUR runs low full toss, quick too, and he has just timed it down the ground for four. This looks like a single from the time it leaves the bat. Warner is thinking single too, but he has timed it exceptionally well. Beats long-on to his right"

216,"Shapoor to Smith, 1 run yorker from round the wicket, driven to deep cover for one"

225,"Hamid to Marsh, 1 run yorker, a low full toss maybe, driven to long-on for one"
226,"Hamid to Haddin, 1 run makes room to drive this full ball to deep extra cover for a single"
