0,10.50am Cameron White has won the toss in his first ODI as captain and Australia will bat.
1,"Anderson to Paine, no run full and straight to begin with, Paine defends"
2,"Anderson to Paine, 1 wide oops, this one goes down leg and doesn't swing back - it's called a wide"
3,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run another one swings down leg but this time Paine clips it through square to get off the mark"
4,"Anderson to Haddin, no run good ball, swinging away from Haddin, and it goes through to Steve Davies, who has the gloves on instead of Matt Prior"
5,"Anderson to Haddin, no run dropped at second slip! Anderson draws a genuine edge from Haddin, Yardy dives across to his left, across in front of Strauss, but grasses the chance. That should have been taken, but it was probably the skipper's catch"
6,"Anderson to Haddin, no run left alone outside off"
7,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run banged in at the hips and Haddin gets off the mark with a single worked to square leg"
8,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run Plunkett begins with a straight ball and Haddin flicks it through midwicket"
9,"Plunkett to Paine, 3 runs good placement from Paine as Plunkett goes a touch too straight again, Paine just clips it into the gap between midwicket and mid-on, not trying to hit it too hard"
10,"Plunkett to Haddin, 2 runs fullish and wide of off, Haddin jams the bat down to drive square through point"
11,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide wrong line, well down leg side"
12,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run better line now as Plunkett goes just outside off and angles it back in a touch, it's left alone"
13,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide another wide down leg side - both bowlers have battled to get the right line so far today"
14,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run punched to mid-off and can't find the gap"
15,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run straighter ball now and it's defended away to the off side"
16,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run again Anderson picks up a thick edge, this one from Paine flies through where a fourth slip might have been, and it runs away to third man"
17,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin loves that shot! He backs away just a fraction and slams it inside out over cover for the first boundary of the match - a touch risky, perhaps, but he's hit that one well enough"
18,"Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter now and Haddin drives, but can't beat mid-off"
19,"Anderson to Haddin, no run straight-bat defence from Haddin"
20,"Anderson to Haddin, no run a bit of width from Anderson and Haddin cuts hard, but straight to point"
21,"Anderson to Haddin, no run another one cut straight to point"
22,"Plunkett to Paine, no run defended to the leg side"
23,"Plunkett to Paine, no run ooh, another leading edge this time from Paine as he tries to flick to leg and it lobs safely short of the man at cover"
24,"Plunkett to Paine, OUT ah, now, we have a review that could be for both caught and lbw. Paine was walking down the pitch and tried to flick the ball to leg, it's hit him on the pad and lobbed out to cover, where the catch has been taken. So England want to know if it's either lbw or caught, which Paul Reiffel decides a"

26,"Plunkett to Ferguson, no run straight bat from Ferguson as he pushes it back to Plunkett"

29,"Anderson to Ferguson, no run full and straight, no swing this time from Anderson, and Ferguson defends"
30,"Anderson to Ferguson, 1 leg bye swinging down leg there and would have been a wide, but it's slammed into Ferguson's pad and run away for a leg bye"
31,"Anderson to Haddin, no run solidly defended by Haddin, who is one of the few senior players in this Australian side today"
32,"Anderson to Haddin, no run pushed away to the leg side this time"
33,"Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin watchfully defends again - he'd love a big innings going in to the World Cup"
34,"Plunkett to Ferguson, no run pushed away defensively to the off side"
35,"Plunkett to Ferguson, no run good bounce and carry through to Davies as this one beats the bat of Ferguson"

43,"Anderson to Ferguson, 1 run quick single now as Ferguson gets on the back foot and punches it to mid-off"
44,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 leg bye another one swings away down the leg side, and again it's not put away, Haddin can only get pad on this and it dribbles away to the on side"
45,"Anderson to Ferguson, no run again Ferguson is on the back foot, punching an accurate Anderson delivery to mid-off"
46,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run he begins with a half-volley that Haddin pushes to cover for a quick single"
47,"Finn to Ferguson, no run another half-volley from Finn, whose run-up is ever so McGrath-like, and Ferguson pushes to mid-off"
48,"Finn to Ferguson, FOUR runs Ferguson frees himself up now and gets a much-needed boundary as he backs off a fraction and forces a cut through point, it runs away to the boundary"
49,"Finn to Ferguson, no run defended back down the pitch"
50,"Finn to Ferguson, FOUR runs and there's another boundary from Ferguson, really good wristy stuff as he flicks one off the leg-stump line through midwicket and it's run all the way along the ground, well timed and placed"
51,"Finn to Ferguson, no run fuller and straighter, and Ferguson blocks it"
52,"Anderson to Haddin, no run good probing line outside off and Haddin just defends to point"
53,"Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin isn't really middling the ball today, and he's moved across outside leg a touch and tried to force it down the ground, but gets an inside edge into his right leg, in a bit of pain there as it got the unpadded section"
54,"Anderson to Haddin, no run banged in shorter now and Haddin leaves it alone"
55,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run again Haddin gives himself room but then just checks his shot and nudges it behind point"
56,"Anderson to Ferguson, OUT Ferguson is gone! Good ball from Anderson as this one bounces sharply outside off and Ferguson fends, and it's well taken high and to the right of Strauss, the only slip in place. Ferguson probably didn't have to play at that bouncer - it wasn't aimed at the body."
57,"Anderson to White, no run banged in at the body and White nudges to leg"
58,"Finn to Haddin, no run full and straight and Haddin meets it with a good on-drive, but straight to mid-on"
59,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run this one's more gently driven down to mid-on and that allows Haddin to hurry a single"
60,"Finn to White, no run Finn aiming to hit the top of off stump here and White defends with a dead bat"
61,"Finn to White, no run banged in short of a length now and White defends"
62,"Finn to White, no run again Finn is hitting the corridor just on or a touch outside off - White meets it with a straight bat"
63,"Finn to White, no run fuller and a little straighter, White defends to mid-on"
64,"Anderson to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin middles this one! And he's smashed it over mid-off for the first six of the match. What a good stroke, he's cleared the fence and that will give him some confidence"
65,"Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin backs away a little and it's beaten him, through to Davies"
66,"Anderson to Haddin, no run short of a length again and Haddin defends"
67,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run swivels a pull away behind square leg now but this is just a single"
68,"Anderson to White, 1 run White gets himself off the mark now, glancing a bad ball down leg and Finn at fine leg slides across to save the boundary"
69,"Anderson to Haddin, no run ah, nasty delivery now that jags back in and bounces sharply, it flies off the hip - and possibly bat - and lobs safely short of the man at short fine leg"
70,"Finn to White, no run Finn is banging it in short of a length here but not getting much bounce - White angles the bat and pushes to gully"
71,"Finn to White, no run this one bounces more, and White defends off the back foot"
72,"Finn to White, no run nudged away towards cover and White can't find a gap"
73,"Finn to White, no run again White nudges to off, no run there"
74,"Finn to White, no run ah, great bouncer as it's well directed and White is in all sorts of bother trying to get away from this - it's whacked the shoulder of the bat, just in front of the helmet"
75,"Finn to White, no run banged in shortish again and White can't get it away"
76,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run again Haddin backs away, as he is wont to do, and it's a swing and a miss"
77,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run nudges it away towards point and can't find a run"
78,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run this time Haddin gets it off the middle, as he tries to thump it over cover, but a man in the deep cuts it off"
79,"Plunkett to White, no run cracking save by Bell at gully! White lashed this cut into the ground and for all money that looked to have beaten Bell, who hurled himself to his left and just got his hand to it"
80,"Plunkett to White, 1 run pushed gently towards mid-on now and White does get a single this time"
81,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 leg bye angling a touch down leg and Haddin can't get it away properly, just getting one wide of Davies"
82,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn continues to bowl well, and Haddin can only push it jumpily to gully"
83,"Finn to Haddin, no run straighter and angling in a touch, Haddin defends"
84,"Finn to Haddin, no run yet another leading edge, and Haddin is very lucky to get away with this. He's shaped to pull, but then stopped halfway through it and the ball has lobbed off his edge short of point"
85,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run tucked away off the hips for a single"
86,"Finn to White, no run White defends again and can't get a single"
87,"Finn to White, FOUR runs hmmm, a boundary, and pretty well played in the end. White has changed his shot halfway through playing it, shaping to pull and then deciding to guide it uppishly wide of the sole slip and it races away to third-man for a boundary. Second slip could have snaffled that, if there was one."
88,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run flicked away through square leg for a single"
89,"Plunkett to White, 1 run"
90,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run Haddin again backs away and tries to swipe it through cover, but it bounces over the stumps and through to Davies"
91,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run oh dear, a top edge now as Haddin goes for the pull, and he's again lucky that this one doesn't carry, it falls short of mid-on"
92,"Plunkett to White, no run nudged away to the off side"
93,"Plunkett to White, no run England want a review for an lbw shout that is turned down, but this looked to be angling down leg, if there wasn't an inside edge. Let's see. And yes indeed, that was a big inside edge, so the decision stands. Strange that it was reviewed, as none of the England players really went up for th"
94,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn rams one in back of a length, as has been England's way today, and Haddin as usual skips leg side of the ball to defend on his toes to cover"
95,"Finn to Haddin, 1 leg bye dropped by Davies! Oh, no, apparently it's a legbye. Top delivery, turned Haddin right around, flicked the back thigh pad and Davies put down the non-chance diving to his right"
96,"Finn to White, no run good lengths and lines for Finn, enjoying the trampoline bounce and White as usual has the most horridly stiff wrists and cannot work the ball in defence"
97,"Finn to White, no run another clunked back-foot defence. England like it up at White, who doesn't appear to enjoy it"
98,"Finn to White, 1 run this is short again and finally White wheels away a stiff-armed pull shot that trickles down to fine leg"
99,"Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin continues his exhibition of self-restraint by drawing his bat inside the line and flagging this through to Davies"
100,"Plunkett to White, 1 run Plunkett working up some decent wheels with his horridly clunky action and White manages somehow to squeeze this out to third man, half-guide half-cut shot"
101,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide oops, shoved down the leg side and Plunkett will have to bowl this again"
102,"Plunkett to Haddin, no run back onto a fine line, hugging off stump and meeting the patient straight bat of Haddin"
103,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run a touch too straight from Plunkett and it's worked around the corner"
104,"Plunkett to White, 1 run Plunkett not following the short-ball plan to White, instead opting for its spiritual opposite - the yorker - which is slightly undercooked and flicked to the leg side"
105,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide a good short ball that bounces up around off stump is given a wide. It's because bowlers aren't allowed to be threatening in ODI cricket"
106,"Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run this is turning into a lengthy over but Plunkett hasn't actually bowled that badly and this is pushed to cover for a swift single"
107,"Plunkett to White, no run good finish to the over, Plunkett bangs it in short of a length and White has to stand up to defend uncomfortably"
108,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run Finn, who is looking oddly orange today, bangs in a short ball that is dropped into the leg side and Finn hares off after it to field. One of the few people still enthusiastic about this seven-match trudge of a series"
109,"Finn to White, 1 run shortish again and White is resolute in defence, pushing square of the wicket"
110,"Finn to Haddin, no run slower ball from the orangeman, who is not Celtic, as far as I know, well directed too and Haddin defends"
111,"Finn to Haddin, no run quicker this time and it darts past Haddin's attempted back cut"
112,"Finn to Haddin, no run excellent lines and lengths from Haddin, who seems to wear a permanent smile, or smirk if you're English, defends carefully"
113,"Finn to Haddin, no run left alone outside off stump to finish the over"
114,"Wright to White, no run starts well, full of bounding enthusiasm and potential incompetence, on middle and defended"
115,"Wright to White, 1 run similar delivery to the last and White turns his heavy wrists over the ball to midwicket"
116,"Wright to Haddin, no run Wright lands another good delivery, following Haddin as he backed away, and it's defended back to the bowler"
117,"Wright to Haddin, 1 wide this is slipped down the leg side, and no amount of bright-eyed apology can stop this being a wide"
118,"Wright to Haddin, 1 leg bye leg-sided again and it thudded off the pads and trickled into the leg side"
119,"Wright to White, 1 run fullish and straightish and not much the batsman can do but defend"
120,"Wright to Haddin, 1 run Haddin as usual backs away and this gives him the room to steer behind point"
121,"Yardy to Haddin, no run starts well enough, straight, no sign of turn and it's pushed back to the bowler"
122,"Yardy to Haddin, 1 run very short from Yardy, that earns a hint of turn and Haddin has to wait a long, long time to cut to deep point"
123,"Yardy to White, 1 leg bye White is the sort of man that could stand tall and smash this out of Perth, instead he gets down apologetically on one-knee and misses a ramp-sweep. Awful that"
124,"Yardy to Haddin, OUT smart work from Finn on the long-on boundary sees the end of Haddin! Poor shot really, he just lifted the ball without much intent towards Finn on the boundary, who back-pedalled to take the catch, felt himself about to go over the rope to through the ball up, stepped over before coming back and c"
125,"Yardy to White, no run more careful defence from White, who has remodelled himself on Boycott"
126,"Yardy to White, 1 run yet again White is on the paddle-sweep, he's so tall and bulky it makes no sense, but there you go. He gets enough to earn a single around the corner"
127,"Wright to White, 1 run White really does hare in, his run up is hilariously quicker than his bowling, the line is good though and it's pushed to mid-on"
128,"Wright to Hussey, no run more good discipline from Wright and Hussey, another who likes to stand leg-side of the ball, defends to cover"
129,"Wright to Hussey, no run left alone outside off stump"
130,"Wright to Hussey, FOUR runs for no good reason Wright imagines he has pace and bangs this in short, he doesn't so it sits up invitingly and Hussey does the necessary, thumping this a long way in front of square for four"
131,"Wright to Hussey, no run dropped by Wright, excellent slower ball and Hussey popped it up back to the bowler, they are never easy etc etc, but it should have been taken"
132,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run Hussey celebrates his let-off in typically measured Hussey fashion, working a single behind square on the off side"
133,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run flight! Flight form Yardy! It's nudged around the corner"
134,"Yardy to White, no run this is less flighted but the line is good and White's stiff arms can't work a single"
135,"Yardy to White, 1 run full toss is carefully pushed down the ground"
136,"Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs wonderful fielding from Plunkett on the square leg boundary saves the four, it was firmly pulled from Hussey and deserved four"
137,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run short again and it's pulled with less power for a single"
138,"Yardy to White, 1 run pushed into the off side carefully for a single"
139,"Wright to White, 1 wide adverts interrupted this delivery, so I'm not entirely sure what happened. Send your complaints to the BCCI, who should prevent this from happening"
140,"Wright to White, 1 run ooh, Wright lands this slightly short and the batsman lifted it back towards the bowler who stuck out a hand speculatively but it past him"
141,"Wright to Hussey, no run fuller and straighter and it's carefully defended"
142,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run the line drifts a touch to leg and it's worked off the pads for one"

144,"Wright to White, 1 run this time White picks it off into the leg side for another single"
145,"Wright to Hussey, no run the over finishes with Hussey pushing to cover"
146,"Yardy to White, no run touch short form Yardy but the late cut finds the fielder"
147,"Yardy to White, 1 run White edges down the wicket and works down the ground"
148,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run again it's pushed down the ground for another single"
149,"Yardy to White, 1 run the sound of time passing slowly - Yardy pushed gently down to long-on"
150,"Yardy to Hussey, SIX runs bang! Good grief, to paraphrase Mark Nicholas. Yardy was a touch short and this Hussey got deep into his crease and mowed this into the stands over deep midwicket"
151,"Yardy to Hussey, no run defended to finish the over"
152,"Wright to White, no run Wright finds an off-stump line and it's defended"
153,"Wright to White, 2 runs short again, the last occasion White timed the ball was a year ago I think, so his attempted pull is spooned over midwicket"
154,"Wright to White, no run White sits on the back foot and full-faces back to the bowler"
155,"Wright to White, 1 run touch too leg-sided allows White to turns his hands over the ball"
156,"Wright to Hussey, no run direct hit would have had Hussey out! It was played out to Bell who dived at cover to field smartly, Hussey was still half-way down trying to turn but Bell's throw was well wide"
157,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run no alarm here, just nudged around the corner"
158,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run Yardy darts this into the pads and it's flicked away for an easy single"
159,"Yardy to White, OUT Yardy has another! White tortuous innings ends. White edged down the track but only to bunt this with plenty of inside-edge back to Yardy who gleefully held on to the chance"
160,"Yardy to Voges, no run wow, Yardy finds turn, actual spin past a dangling outside edge"
161,"Yardy to Voges, no run pushed back to the bowler who fields and aims to throw back at the batsman"
162,"Yardy to Voges, no run more careful defence from the front foot"
163,"Yardy to Voges, no run a final forward-block to finish the over"
164,"Plunkett to Hussey, FOUR runs starts with a decent delivery around off stump but Hussey gets leg-side of the ball and opens the face to guide it to third man for four"
165,"Plunkett to Hussey, no run fuller and firmly pushed back to the bowler"
166,"Plunkett to Hussey, FOUR runs ah top shot again, Hussey gets a touch of width and crashes this backwards of point"
167,"Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run yikes, Plunkett has lost his line and length completely and it's cut again firmly but this time to deep cover"
168,"Plunkett to Voges, no run better delivery here - full and straight - and defended back to the bowler"
169,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 run hint of extra bounce finds the outside edge and flies off down to third man to finish a good over for Australia"
170,"Yardy to Voges, no run Voges wants to have a dart but Yardy is cramping his for room"
171,"Yardy to Voges, 3 runs Voges down the wicket again and Yardy responded by dropping it shorter, Voges adjusted by cutting very hard to point"
172,"Yardy to Hussey, no run this is a touch leg-sided and clips the pads"
173,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run more of a bat on this and it's driven down the ground"
174,"Yardy to Voges, no run pushed into the on side"
175,"Yardy to Voges, FOUR runs excellent flick, fine around the corner earns four, really well played"
176,"Plunkett to Hussey, 1 wide Plunkett gets his line wrong, shoving this down the leg side"
177,"Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run Hussey bunts this gently into the legside and Plunkett runs around to field"
178,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 run short ball and Voges doesn't get much of a pull shot so it trickles away"
179,"Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run short and legsided again and once again the pull shot isn't timed all that well"
180,"Plunkett to Voges, no run good delivery here, hugging off stump and it's blocked"
181,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 wide banged in short, but too short and it sails way over the batsman"
182,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 run Plunkett adjusts his line and finds a fuller length, rewarded with an outside edge that runs down to third man"
183,"Plunkett to Hussey, no run finishes the over with a full and straight ball that is pushed back to the bowler who fields and throws the ball back at the keeper"
184,"Yardy to Voges, 1 run Yardy gets his line wrong and is turned around the corner for a single"
185,"Yardy to Hussey, no run full and straight and pushed into the off side"
186,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run pushed wide of cover"
187,"Yardy to Voges, 1 run Yardy trundles in and is milked down the ground"
188,"Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey gets deep in his crease to steer a full ball past cover"
189,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run Hussey carefully watches this onto the bat and guides it away for a single"
190,"Trott to Hussey, 1 run quality start from Trott, he's done this slow-medium very well this tour, and it's carefully defended"
191,"Trott to Voges, FOUR runs wow, good timing here, Trott gets his line wrong and it's flicked through midwicket for four"
192,"Trott to Voges, 1 run this is worked to midwicket again but this time just for one"
193,"Trott to Hussey, 4 leg byes Trott gets his line wrong again, and it's far too full for Davies to get hold of, flicked off the pad down to the fine leg rope"
194,"Trott to Hussey, 1 run this time the line is better and it's pushed down the ground"
195,"Trott to Voges, 1 run full and straight again and pushed down the ground for a jogged single"

206,"Wright to Hussey, no run another slower ball is driven to mid-off"
207,"Wright to Hussey, FOUR runs french-cut gets the boundary! Nips back, flicks an inside edge that runs past the stumps and past the diving Davies"
208,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run pushed to cover for a quick single to finish the over"
209,"Yardy to Hussey, FOUR runs Yardy finds a good line but some wonderful timing from a forward-push sees the ball racing to the cover boundary. This partnership has been superb"
210,"Yardy to Hussey, no run defended back to the bowler"
211,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run again it's pushed back at the bowler but a diving Yardy can't cut off the single"

216,"Wright to Voges, no run nudged away defensively by Voges"
217,"Wright to Voges, 2 runs lofted over midwicket now and it's just lobbed short of the man in the deep, a chip shot really"
218,"Wright to Voges, 3 runs lovely cut shot as Wright gives Voges some width, and Yardy running around from third man stops this with his foot - he's obviously not keen on the dive! Good way to break an ankle, though, if you get it wrong"
219,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run again too short from Wright, and Hussey pulls to deep midwicket on the bounce"
220,"Wright to Voges, 2 runs good stuff from Hussey and Voges here, another quick single pushed to cover - and in fact, that has become two, as England get a bit sloppy and allow an overthrow"
221,"Finn to Hussey, no run clipped away to leg and can't find a run"
222,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run cut down into the ground and it runs away past Davies to third man, but is cut off and they can only manage a single"
223,"Finn to Voges, FOUR runs beautiful cut by Voges! He's waited, cut late and timed it so well that third man can't save it with a sprawling dive to his right, that's a really great stroke"

229,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run Wright is down leg once more, and Hussey once again tucks a single to fine leg - the scoreboard keeps ticking over"
230,"Wright to Voges, 1 run too straight - Wright needs to get across just a tad outside off - and Voges clips another one through square leg"
231,"Wright to Hussey, no run better line this time and Hussey defends to the off side"
232,"Wright to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey goes for the cut now and gets it through point, and that's superb running as they sprint back for two, Hussey narrowly beating a slightly wide throw from Plunkett that is collected by Davies. A better throw and it would have been tight."
233,"Finn to Voges, no run Voges clunks a drive into the ground and back to Finn"
234,"Finn to Voges, FOUR runs brilliant late cut! Voges played that same shot in the last over for the same result - this one was even crisper, sailing along the turf and beating third man comfortably."
235,"Finn to Voges, no run straighter line from Finn now and Voges nudges to off, thinks of a quick single, and decides against it"

237,"Finn to Hussey, no run defended back down the pitch"
238,"Finn to Hussey, 1 wide wrong line and this is called a wide as Hussey doesn't get anything on an attempted glance"
239,"Wright to Hussey, no run half a shout for lbw as Hussey plays across the line, trying to work it to leg and the ball lobs off his pad to the off side. Wright didn't go through with the appeal, and that was sliding down leg"
240,"Wright to Hussey, no run Hussey meets this with the full face of the bat, trying for a punchy drive past the bowler but Wright hurls himself to his left to save the run"
241,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run another whippy clip through midwicket, which is a shot Hussey plays a lot. It's not graceful, but it's effective"
242,"Wright to Voges, no run pushed away to cover and Voges can't get a run"
243,"Wright to Voges, 1 run straight ball from Wright and Voges turns it off his hips through square leg"
244,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run really good, quick running as Hussey nudges to short midwicket and takes off - they picked their fieldsman there, as it was Matt Prior"
245,"Plunkett to Hussey, OUT Plunkett strikes! Hussey tries to turn this one to leg but it's bounced a touch more than he expected and lobbed off the shoulder of the bat towards point, where Bell takes a smart catch diving forward"
246,"Plunkett to Johnson, no run pushed away to point and Johnson can't find a gap"
247,"Plunkett to Johnson, no run defended back down the pitch by Johnson"
248,"Plunkett to Johnson, 1 run he's off the mark now with a flick to midwicket and Prior's throw misses at the striker's end, where Voges was diving and had made his ground in any case"
249,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 run good sharp running again, Voges pushes forward of point and this throw from Bell does hit the stumps at the non-striker's end but the fast Voges makes it home"
250,"Plunkett to Johnson, 2 runs well played by Johnson, turns this through midwicket gently to pick up a couple more runs"
251,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs Voges works it along the ground through midwicket and again it's good running to collect two more"
252,"Anderson to Voges, 1 run fullish and straight, and Voges punches a drive to mid-off"
253,"Anderson to Johnson, 2 runs high, high, higgggh chance from Johnson! And Finn has missed it! Johnson has tried to whack Anderson over midwicket a big leading edge flies a long way up and Finn at short third man runs back, swirls around and totally misjudges it, not an easy one at all"
254,"Anderson to Johnson, no run driven clunkily back to Anderson"
255,"Anderson to Johnson, OUT Prior has taken a stunner in the deep! Oh, he can catch it without gloves after all! Johnson swung from the hips, trying to clear the boundary at midwicket, and Prior was about 10 metres inside, then backed back and leapt high to take the catch above his head - terrific catch."
256,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs pulled through midwicket for a couple"
257,"Finn to Hastings, 1 wide Hastings walks across towards leg and this one sails down the leg side - wide is called"
258,"Finn to Hastings, 1 run good bouncer - well-directed, and Hastings can only fend this away for a run"
259,"Finn to Voges, 1 wide once again Finn is tricked by the wandering of Voges, who backs off, then walks across outside leg and tries to hook a ball that Finn speared down leg. Wide called."
260,"Finn to Voges, 2 runs slower ball from Finn, who decides just to bowl straight, and Voges cuts hard for two runs as Bell at point knocks it down without taking it cleanly"
261,"Finn to Voges, 1 run Voges backs away a little and punches it back past Finn for a single"
262,"Finn to Hastings, FOUR runs a valuable boundary now as Finn goes down leg once more, and Hastings glances it fine enough to beat the man at fine leg, who makes a desperate but unsuccessful slide"

264,"Finn to Voges, 1 run punched down the ground for a single to long-off"

269,"Wright to Johnson, no run defended away safely"
270,"Wright to Johnson, 1 run punched through cover for a comfortable single"
271,"Plunkett to Johnson, 1 run flicked off the hips of Johnson, who will get his eye in for a couple of overs before they think about the Powerplay"
272,"Plunkett to Voges, no run Voges defends this with a straight bat"
273,"Plunkett to Voges, 2 runs a little too short from Plunkett and Voges is quickly on to this pull, along the ground to deep midwicket for two more"
274,"Plunkett to Voges, no run guides this cut to gully and can't beat Bell"
275,"Plunkett to Voges, no run good line from Plunkett, giving Voges no width, and it's defended"
276,"Plunkett to Voges, 1 run again Voges gets the late cut away but third man is wider now to cut off those boundaries"
277,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs clipped high over midwicket now, more like a chip shot as it lands short of the man in the deep"
278,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs driven uppishly towards long-on now and and lands safely again, they hare back for a couple more"
279,"Anderson to Voges, 1 wide another England wide, slipped down the leg side"
280,"Anderson to Voges, 1 run a touch leg-sided again and swung to fine leg"
281,"Anderson to Hastings, OUT Hastings backed away without looking too sure of what he was doing, Anderson banged it in a touch shorter and a thickish top edge looped out to cover"
282,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs slower bouncer is wheeled away to deep midwicket and then there is sudden alarm as the batsmen come back for two, not sure how they made it but in the end it was clearly home"
283,"Anderson to Voges, 2 runs Voges backs away and Anderson lands another slow bouncer that is swatted in front of midwicket to end, finally, Anderson's bowling in Australia. He's had an incredible tour"
284,"Finn to Krejza, 1 wide Finn starts the final over by shoving it down the leg side for another wide"
285,"Finn to Krejza, 2 wide how long will this over last!? Banged in short and it sails over the batsman, Davies just about gets a hand on it so they run byes as well"
286,"Finn to Voges, 2 runs slower ball but crucially it's straight, bunted to mid-on and some very swift running turns one into two"
287,"Finn to Voges, 1 run slower ball dragged from outside off stump into the leg side but just for a single this time"

289,"Finn to Krejza, 2 runs big mow from a length ball skews off the inside edge into the midwicket region"
290,"Finn to Krejza, 2 runs the final ball is sliced over the infield down to deep long-off, Voges finishes unbeaten on 80"
291,"Very good recovery from Australia puts them in charge. England were impressive at times and tawdry at others. 19 wides tells you all you need to know, Australia have probably 19 too many. Andrew McGlashan will have a bulletin ready shortly and we'll be back in about 30mins. In the meantime check out our YouTube channel."
292,"Right, no time for dawdling the innings is about to start again. Tait to Strauss. England have Davies opening, would they want him to crack a century? Would make the selectors look plenty silly."
293,"Tait to Strauss, no run whoosh, Tait starts very quickly and it's left alone outside off stump"
294,"Tait to Trott, no run fired in a touch shorter and Trott shuffles across his stumps to drop to leg"
295,"Tait to Trott, 1 wide and this is slung too wide of off. Guess that will happen with him every now and then"

297,"Tait to Davies, 1 wide Davies watches his first ball go down the leg side"

303,"Bollinger to Davies, 1 wide touch of swing here, from the bowler and from the batsman, who aimed an airy drive and missed it. This was given a wide, which is a touch harsh"

308,"Tait to Trott, 1 wide shoved down the leg side this time. Quick though"
309,"Tait to Trott, no run slower ball this time, Trott happily pats it to midwicket. Full toss in the end perhaps Trott should have done more with it"

311,"Tait to Trott, 1 wide pace and width draws Trott into a flat-footed waft outside off which he misses"

314,"Tait to Trott, no run good delivery here to finish the over, fullish and swinging away. Solidly blocked to mid-off"
315,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 wide good lord, another wide. Bollinger bangs this in short of a length and down the leg side"
316,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off stump this time, but it's close enough to off stump to prevent a wide"
317,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run fuller and straighter and carefully blocked, the inside edge carries it around the corner for one"
318,"Bollinger to Trott, 1 run Trott without fuss picks up a single dabbing into the midwicket region"
319,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run ooh, good ball, nipped back from a length as Pietersen lunged forward and crashed into the elbow of the bottom arm"
320,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run after all that alarm last delivery Pietersen decides to leave this alone outside off"
321,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run ah, there's the silly shot, Pietersen walks across his stumps and aims a swish to the midwicket boundary. He missed and it crashed into the body. I suppose if he nailed it, it would have been a great shot"
322,"Tait to Trott, 3 runs Trott clips a full ball straight of midwicket for three"
323,"Tait to Pietersen, 2 runs bit of width from Tait and Pietersen threw his arms at it, toe-ended a bit and it went airily through cover"
324,"Tait to Pietersen, 2 runs bit more bat on this drive, still not timed perfectly and it goes through point for a couple more"
325,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 wide this is yet another wide, banged in short and down the leg side. Pietersen had an almighty thwack but missed"
326,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 wide wide, wide, wide, wide. Short and outside off this time. Pietersen ended up hopping on one leg to aim a swish to off but couldn't reach it"
327,"Tait to Pietersen, FOUR runs close enough for Pietersen this time to smash a widish offside delivery for four through cover"
328,"Tait to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is playing like a millionaire. He's having a bash at absolutely everything. Again he's missed it, clever slower ball dribbled through to Haddin"
329,"Tait to Pietersen, FOUR runs ah, full half-volley on leg stump and Pietersen clips it powerfully wide of mid-on for four"
330,"Bollinger to Trott, 2 runs Trott runs outside leg stump and Bollinger follows him, he still manages to squeeze it out over point for a couple"
331,"Bollinger to Trott, no run orthodoxy returns with Bollinger finding a decent length and line and is steered to point"

337,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run excellent start from Johnson, very straight and Pietersen is uncomfortable with defence"

340,"Johnson to Trott, FOUR runs ah, fuller and the width Trott needs to stroke past point, with plenty of timing and it runs away for four"

351,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is beaten again outside off stump, aiming a wafty drive"
352,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run this time he does manage to get bat on ball to a length ball outside off stump, driven to mid-off"
353,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen fiddles this off his pads around the corner for a single to bring the new batsman Ian Bell on strike"
354,"Bollinger to Bell, 1 run Bell gets a shorter ball that he pulls gently down to fine leg"
355,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run fuller ball to Pietersen, who has calmed down a wee bit after a frantic start, and drives to mid-off"
356,"Bollinger to Bell, FOUR runs just a hint of width and Bell times an elegant cut shot that speeds to the point boundary"

362,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run oh dear, this is a full ball that Pietersen aims a pull at, through him in a flash"

422,"Hastings to Prior, no run pushed away to the off side"
423,"Hastings to Prior, no run beaten outside off. Or is it? Hastings appeals enthusiastically, as does the captain White, although Haddin isn't that interested. Prior tried to dab it away and there must have been a noise. Anyway, White wants a review. Hot Spot doesn't seem to have shown anything, and the not-out decision"
424,"Hastings to Prior, 1 wide bouncer a little down leg now and Prior misses his hook - that's called a wide, the indication coming from square-leg for the height of that ball, which was a touch above the head"
425,"Hastings to Prior, 1 run good cut from Prior, who gets a single through point"
426,"Hastings to Yardy, 1 run oooh, a run-out chance here as Yardy nudges to off and is slow to react to Prior's call - Hussey from gully collects and throws, but Yardy manages to get his body between the ball and the stumps, so it's hit him on the back of the legs.

445,"Krejza to Yardy, 1 run too short, and Yardy has no trouble crunching it through cover"
446,"Krejza to Prior, 1 run again it's too short, Prior muscles a pull through square leg, but he probably could have done better with that and found a gap"
447,"Hastings to Prior, 1 run Prior drives comfortably through cover for another single"
448,"Hastings to Yardy, 1 run Yardy this time finds the gap at cover, just getting himself another single"

451,"Hastings to Yardy, 2 runs fullish and straight, and Yardy closes the face to work this through midwicket and they pick up two to Paine in the deep"
452,"Hastings to Yardy, no run left alone outside off"
453,"Krejza to Wright, 2 runs a bit too short from Krejza, but Wright can only tickle it down the leg side to fine leg"
454,"Krejza to Wright, no run oh, a run-out chance goes begging! Wright worked it around the corner to leg, the batsmen took off and then both turned back as Paine got across quickly from short midwicket, but in his dive to the ball Paine has fumbled it and doesn't get his throw away"
455,"Krejza to Wright, FOUR runs ah, bad ball. Wright latches quickly on to a short one and thumps a pull through square leg for a boundary"
456,"Krejza to Wright, FOUR runs and again Krejza drags it down, and again Wright's eyes light up and he pulls hard through square leg for another four"
457,"Krejza to Wright, 1 run better ball, fuller and outside off, and Wright cuts late"
458,"Tait to Wright, no run Wright cuts, and it's well fielded at gully"
459,"Tait to Wright, no run again Wright tries to cut but Tait is just too quick, it's an under edge that dribbles away to slip"
460,"Tait to Wright, FOUR runs lovely shot from Wright as Tait gives him a half-volley, and it's pushed through cover point without much flair but with excellent timing. Good shot."
461,"Tait to Wright, no run and Tait responds with a bouncer! Wright wants nothing to do with a well-directed bumper at 145kph, and he ducks it."
462,"Tait to Wright, no run again it's a bouncer - and at 151kph mind you! Wright did try to slap a pull away but was never quick enough on that shot, and Haddin did well to make the take"
463,"Tait to Wright, (no ball) horrid delivery from Tait, a full toss down leg side which would have been wide, but worse for Australia it's actually a front-foot no-ball, which means a free hit"
464,"Tait to Wright, 2 runs Tait goes for the slower bouncer, and Wright flays at his free hit, lobbing it up over point but not quite timing it"
465,"Krejza to Yardy, 1 run Yardy has time again as Krejza is just a touch too short, and it's cut away safely"
466,"Krejza to Wright, 1 run tossed up outside off and turning in, but again it's not full enough, and Wright waits to cut it through cover point"

468,"Krejza to Wright, 1 run Wright tucks it away behind square leg, again it was too short"

470,"Krejza to Yardy, no run defended away to the off side now"
471,"Hussey to Wright, 1 run tossed up invitingly and Wright actually times a drive"
472,"Hussey to Yardy, no run driven carefully to cover"
473,"Hussey to Yardy, no run touch of air again and pushed to cover"

482,"Johnson to Yardy, no run Johnson returns and fires this into Yard's pads"
483,"Johnson to Yardy, no run this is up outside off stump and it's left all alone"
484,"Johnson to Yardy, no run full, straight and crashed into Yardy's pads. It looked very straight by the umpire wasn't interested and the Aussies don't fancy a referral"
485,"Johnson to Yardy, no run Yardy opts this time to leave alone outside off"
486,"Johnson to Yardy, 1 wide this is slung down the leg side and Yardy can't connect with his attempted fiddle"
487,"Johnson to Yardy, 1 wide this is down the leg side again, further than the last"
488,"Johnson to Yardy, no run this is straight and pushed down to mid-on"
489,"Johnson to Yardy, 1 run full and tucked around the corner for single"
490,"Krejza to Yardy, 2 runs Krejza gives this plenty of air, but it's down the leg side and past the keeper and Tait has to give chase"
491,"Krejza to Yardy, no run this is straighter and defended"
492,"Krejza to Yardy, no run touch quicker and flatter and again careful defence"
493,"Krejza to Yardy, no run back cut from outside off speeds to short third man"
494,"Krejza to Yardy, 1 run Yardy pushes to midwicket and sets off for a very tight single"
495,"Krejza to Plunkett, 1 run Plunkett gets across his stumps to work this neatly onto the leg side for one"
496,"Johnson to Plunkett, no run Johnson lands an absolute pearler, reverse-swinging away past a hapless Plunkett outside edge"
497,"Johnson to Plunkett, 1 run this is a touch shorter and Plunkett gets precious bat on ball guiding to deep third man"
498,"Johnson to Yardy, 1 run more reverse swing at a yorker length this time and Yardy jabs it away"
499,"Johnson to Plunkett, no run beaten again outside off. Plunkett prods forward and it speeds past the outside edge"
500,"Johnson to Plunkett, no run this time Plunkett decides he's better off leaving alone. Johnson is bowling rather well here"
501,"Johnson to Plunkett, no run more swing, late and bending away late, it's through Plunkett, getting a pad on its way through to Haddin. Given out by caught but Plunkett reviewed straight away and it was heading over, so can't be lbw and missed the bat, so can't be caught. Great delivery though, Johnson is a man transfo"
502,"Krejza to Yardy, 1 run little bit short here so even with a fraction of spin and back-foot drive through point is easy"
503,"Krejza to Plunkett, no run fuller here and pushed to mid-on"
504,"Krejza to Plunkett, 1 run too short and Plunkett unfurls a strong pull shot that is fielded smartly on the square-leg boundary"

524,"Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this time Yardy stays up and pushes to cover"
525,"Hussey to Plunkett, 1 run Plunkett on the dab sweep now, completing it far better than Yardy to collect a single"

550,"Bollinger to Yardy, 2 runs oh well played! Yardy has smashed this straight back at the bowler, and Bollinger did well to get his head out of the way, so hard was that struck. He had no chance to get the hands up for a catch, and Krejza at mid-off only just saves it"

Watson is the Player of the Series. And Cameron White begins his ODI captaincy career with a victory."
