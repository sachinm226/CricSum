0,"3pm Time for the toss...heads call AB de Villiers but it lands a tail. Australia have won the toss and have decided to bowl first. Xavier Doherty comes in for Dan Christian to add an extra spin option for them. For South Africa, AB reckons he would have batted first anyway and brings in Wayne Parnell for Albie Morkel."
1,"Doherty to Levi, no run full around middle and leg, punched back to the bowler"
2,"Doherty to Levi, no run further towards leg stump, goes to flick it away and gets struck on the pad, was going down"
3,"Doherty to Levi, OUT and this goes straight through Levi's attempted drive and flicks out leg stump, what a start for Doherty. He seemed to get outside leg stump, exposing all three, this time trying to drive a good length ball into the covers, but it skidded on past his stroke and cleaned him up, the miserable run continues for Levi"
4,"Doherty to Kallis, 1 run and drives his first ball from off stump down to long off"
5,"Doherty to Amla, 1 run leg stump and clipped out to deep square"

10,"Starc to Kallis, no run this is certainly an indication of the pace of the wicket, this is back of a length, Kallis goes to pull and is there too soon, gets hit on the body"
11,"Starc to Kallis, FOUR runs full ball just outside off, didn't seem to be perfectly timed, but gets it down the ground for four, had to slightly drag it but effective"
12,"Starc to Kallis, 1 run more conventional, coming forward and punching a length ball to mid off, the take a quick single"
13,"Doherty to Kallis, OUT oh edged and gone and Doherty gets another. It's a cracking delivery, tossed up on a length just outside off, Kallis pushed at it and got a thin edge to Wade to held the chance very well, it was a decent edge. What a start for Doherty, what a selection. Beautifully bowled, flighted nicely and a little turn this time gets the edge of Kallis"
14,"Doherty to Duminy, no run back on the off stump blocking"
15,"Doherty to Duminy, 1 run back again, this time clipped into midwicket"
16,"Doherty to Amla, SIX runs floated up again but Amla gives himself a little bit of room and lifts it over extra cover and it flies into the stands, awesome timing, picked up from off stump, heavens is this guy in good touch"
17,"Doherty to Amla, no run dragged down a little short, the cut stroke only finds cover point"
18,"Doherty to Amla, 1 run step down the track, fired into the pads, Amla adjusts and digs it out towards long off"
19,"Starc to Amla, no run well bowled, little bit of shape in from just outside off, blocked back to the bowler from a length"
20,"Starc to Amla, no run full of a good length, cut and missed at"
21,"Starc to Amla, 1 run good drive to cover point, oh there's a huge mix up, a direct hit and Duminy is miles out, but the throw is so far wide of the one-stump Hussey had to aim at, lucky that for SA"
22,"Starc to Duminy, 1 wide doesn't adjust to the leftie and send it down leg"
23,"Starc to Duminy, no run good length just outside off, driven on the up to backward point on the front foot"
24,"Starc to Duminy, no run just outside off on a similar length, again forward to drive, mistimed to mid off"
25,"Starc to Duminy, FOUR runs fuller and this drive finds the gap between point and cover and runs to the rope"
26,"Cummins to Amla, 1 run back of a length around off stump, blocked into the covers, into the gap for a single"
27,"Cummins to Duminy, no run nicely bowled, yorker length just outside off, dug out and they refuse the wicket single, perhaps with remembering the run out of Gambhir the other night"
28,"Cummins to Duminy, 1 run back of a length, a little straight, dangerous with long leg up, tried to help it around the corner, got it off the glove to the fielder"
29,"Cummins to Amla, FOUR runs gives himself room and edges a length delivery past short long leg for four. Lucky that, tried to go through the off side but got a big edge"

35,"Watson to Amla, no run back of a length again, punched to cover"
36,"Watson to Amla, OUT step across the stumps, goes to pull and gloved behind! Amla falls and Watson does the job again. A shorter ball, again not coming on as the batsman might expect, Amla went across his stumps to pull into the leg side, but was through with the stroke too soon and gloved a ball to Wade and walked straight off, what a blow for Australia"

47,"Hogg to Duminy, 1 run touch fuller, clipped into the vacant midwicket area again, Hogg chases and fields himself"

51,"Watson to de Villiers, 1 run full ball, tapped to midwicket, Duminy is sent back, a direct hit but Duminy was back, the ball ricochets away for a single after all"
52,"Watson to Duminy, no run full ball just outside off, driven to mid off"
53,"Watson to Duminy, FOUR runs short and pulled wide of long leg, the slower nature of the pitch should make those short balls easier to put away today, got on top of it nicely and helped it behind square"
54,"Watson to Duminy, 1 run full length just outside off, carved down to third man"
55,"Watson to de Villiers, 1 run the very annoying de Villiers wait-wait-wait-dab to third man, I say annoying because I feel he often misses out on hittable balls doing that"
56,"Watson to Duminy, 1 run well bowled, a little shape in to the off stump, dabbed down towards point and they take a single"

62,"Maxwell to Duminy, 1 run floated up onto leg stump, rolled into the on side"
63,"Watson to de Villiers, OUT or not as the case may be! De Villiers slaps this straight to extra cover and is caught easily!

76,"Doherty to Duminy, OUT and gets another one straight away! Duminy down the track gets beaten and is stumped by a country mile. More lovely flight by Doherty, drew Duminy down the pitch and he was no where near it, tried to adjust, I think the ball ended up going between his legs and my grandfather could have made that stumping with a cup of tea in one hand and a scone in the other"

127,"""Maybe it's because I'm used to Australia's poor showing in T20, or perhaps it's the fear of chasing against any side with Steyn in the attack, but this game is far from over!"" Gareth is spot on this is game on now with those last two overs going for 28 and South Africa scrapping their way up to a competitive total, which with their bowling line up is more than defendable, they should have defended a lower total against Pakistan so will be full of"
128,"Thanks Alex, welcome back for the chase. Australia have a challenging total to chase down here. We're already seeing some Indian and Pakistani fans in the crowd, gearing up for the game to follow, but there's a big match happening now as we speak. Can South Africa defend this?"
