0,"Toss, 9am This is a surprise. Australia have won the toss and Shane Watson has decided to bowl. The pitch in St Vincent was so spinner and slow-ball friendly that batting first was the way to go. I wonder if this surface is different."
1,"Lee to Charles, 1 wide the first ball is down leg side, Charles lets it pass. Lee's unhappy with that call because it may have clipped the thigh pad as the batsman let it go"

4,"Lee to Charles, no run defended on the off side"
5,"Lee to Charles, no run Lee roars a confident appeal for lbw but the umpire says not out. Australia decide not to review. Lee pitched in line and the ball went straight through to hit the pad.

160,"Doherty to Bravo, OUT Dwayne Bravo faces a review first ball ... and he's gone! Doherty tossed one up around leg stump, Bravo leaned forward with his bat against his pad.

493,"Pollard to Hussey, no run length, outside off and dabbed to point"
494,"Pollard to Hussey, FOUR runs wide of the crease, short ball, looping in towards Hussey - it's nowhere near quick enough and the batsman muscles it in front of deep midwicket"
495,"Pollard to Hussey, FOUR runs another long-hop, which Hussey pulls through square leg this time. Pollard's dobblers are being given the treatment"

538,"Roach to Lee, (no ball) ouch! Roach bowls a beamer that strikes Lee flush on the glove. It's a no-ball and Roach goes down the wicket to apologise ... Lee jerked away from that like he'd been scalded. He dropped his bat as the ball struck his left hand, then dropped to his knees. He initially walked away from Roach, as if to compose"
539,"Roach to Lee, 1 run and Roach follows it up with a short ball that Lee keeps away from his ribs by nudging into the leg side. All's fair in cricket and war"
