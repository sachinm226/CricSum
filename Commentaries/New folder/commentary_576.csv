0,1.20pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and sent Australia in. An interesting decision to chase under the lights.
1,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run starts well, landing on a good length and curving the ball away, Gilchrist shouldering arms"
2,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run a tighter one, still that good length but slightly closer to the batsman who waits for it to curl out a touch before defending on the back foot"
3,"Vaas to Gilchrist, 1 run oh, took the outside edge at 126kph, the ball shooting wide of the slips as he pressed forward in a would-be drive"
4,"Vaas to Hayden, no run some good carry there, the ball finding that good length once more and zinging up and away, Sangakkara taking it on the rise"
5,"Vaas to Hayden, no run pushed through again, another dot delivery as it's left on the way through"
6,"Vaas to Hayden, no run still no run to him as the batsman waits for the ball just outside off and defends on the back foot"
7,"Malinga to Gilchrist, 3 runs starts outside off, the batsman waiting and then moving into the line of the ball which he drives off the back foot on the up through the covers"
8,"Malinga to Hayden, no run gets into line on off and defends down off the back foot"
9,"Malinga to Hayden, no run gun-barrel straight again, on line with off stick, defended behind off the back foot"
10,"Malinga to Hayden, no run slings down across the left hander, the ball forced wide away from him and he leaves it, Sangakkara taking it around his ankles"
11,"Malinga to Hayden, no run not much bounce there, the ball ekeing on past the left hander"
12,"Malinga to Hayden, 1 run on middle and leg, turned well off the knee to midwicket"
13,"Vaas to Hayden, FOUR runs like a rocket. Hayden comes down the track, stands tall and shoulders the ball over mid-off for a firmly, sweetly struck four"
14,"Vaas to Hayden, 1 run on middle and off, again Hayden shows his intent by coming out and turning the ball through midwicket"
15,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run but hello, good response from Vaas who hits the deck in line with off and it deviates off the seam with a hint of swing, beating the bat well - and just failing to take the edge"
16,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run outside off, a shortish delivery which is helped into the off-side with a dink off the back foot"
17,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run tightened him up with a good one that was on to him in a hurry, the batsman waiting and defending down off the back foot"
18,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run excellent length again, the ball pitching just outside off and moving away from the left hander who pushes off the back foot, more defensively than anything"
19,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run stays over the wicket and plants the ball on a decent length past the batsman who lets it go on through"
20,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run outside off, jumped onto a hint of length, driven out to the covers"
21,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run flings it down past the left hander once more"
22,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run ramrod straight, up there, forces the batsman to bring down his arms very quickly to defend on the back foot"
23,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run licks it down off at a good pace, the batsman judges well to leave it"
24,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run and again, to round off a good start of a maiden over"
25,"Vaas to Gilchrist, 2 runs well bowled, taking the edge through the vacant second slip area, the batsman flashing hard and getting away with it"
26,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run tightened up down off on a good length, defended in the line"
27,"Vaas to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist advances down the track to meet one which pitched on middle and went on to hit leg as his vain would-be aerial swish towards midwicket got nowhere near the ball"
28,"Vaas to Ponting, no run the left armer stays over to the right hander and forces him to defend outside off on the front foot"
29,"Vaas to Ponting, no run well bowled again, Ponting lets that one through"
30,"Vaas to Ponting, no run swings back in to the right hander, late, and forced up there, Ponting quick to jump into a defence"

32,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run good line again, pushed past the left hander on a decent length, and he shoulders arms"

37,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run plenty of wobble as the ball shimmies down past the left hander"
38,"Vaas to Ponting, no run flings the ball down the off-side channel from over the wicket, left alone"
39,"Vaas to Ponting, no run Ponting is watchful again, the ball slotting on off and pushed up there forcing him to defend on the front foot"
40,"Vaas to Ponting, no run dropped! Dilshan in the gully put it down, the ball was outside off and short, Ponting popped up hard and it ran up Dilshan's arms on the forward dive"
41,"Vaas to Ponting, no run outside off, an angled bat on the front-foot defensive"
42,"Vaas to Ponting, no run short ball on off, defended on the back foot now"
43,"Vaas to Ponting, no run on off, rises onto the back foot and defends down"
44,"Maharoof to Hayden, no run pushed well again past the left hander who makes an elaborate gesture of a leave"

46,"Maharoof to Hayden, 1 run driven out to mid-off and there was a chance of a run-out there, Hayden was struggling and had to dive in the end, a direct hit from Malinga would have been comfortably out"

48,"Maharoof to Ponting, 2 runs on middle and leg, Ponting comes down the track and turns the ball out through the 45, not the most convincing shot"

52,"Vaas to Hayden, no run some curl away from the left hander who defends on the front foot this time"
53,"Vaas to Hayden, FOUR runs shortish on middle and leg, just a hint of room which is enough for Hayden to fashion some kind of room in turning the ball through the 45"
54,"Vaas to Hayden, no run a touch outside off this time, Hayden waits and moves into the line of the ball, defending back down off the back foot"
55,"Vaas to Hayden, no run movement away outside off, but only just, defended on the back foot down"
56,"Maharoof to Ponting, no run good length on off, defended on the front foot, right down the line"

58,"Maharoof to Ponting, no run outside off, defended on the front foot this time"
59,"Maharoof to Ponting, 2 runs width outside off, cut hard to the fielder who knocked it down and they come back for a comfortable two, poor from Jayasuriya who had a gaping hole in his long barrier"

65,"Vaas to Hayden, no run outside off, decent length, defended down"
66,"Vaas to Hayden, 1 run a touch down leg and Hayden thumps behind square leg where the ball bounces once on its way to the fielder, deviates, and is jumped on well and returned"

481,"8.45pm Heavy drizzle and now the players come off, the groundstaff come on. Sri Lanka are 25 behind on D/L right now."
482,"8.55pm C'mon, someone's gotta have a worse joke than Geoff. Just to clarifying, meanwhile, that if there's no resumption, Australia will win on D/L by 24 runs. Lots of fairweather fans have already deserted the G."
483,"9.35pm Regarding the cut-off time, patience my pretties. I'll tell you as soon as someone's told me. Crowd figures meanwhile, there were 27,854 here, which is low for Melbourne on a Friday. Easily half of those must now have left, though. Australia are on for the 24-run win."

485,"While we're waiting for more news, time for an ad break and here's something for a rainy day(-night). Get yourselves this, grab this and unfurl this one from your locker."
486,"""I don't fancy our chances of any more play,"" Brydon doommongers."
487,"9.50pm To confirm, Australia get a bonus point if there is no more play. Our Oracle reckons the cut-off is 10.20pm, so half an hour from now. Although I've heard rumours that it may be 10.30[m, nothing's official yet but about a million times less farcical than the World Cup final finish which is just playing across our screens."
488,"10.10pm The game's off, the rain has worsened, so Australia, as expected, win by 24 runs on the D/L method, grab the bonus point and are through. Thanks for joining us today, come back on Sunday for the next round. Till then, it's goodbye from me."
