0,"Bollinger to de Kock, 1 wide left-arm over the wicket, starts on a shortish length but this slides down the leg side"
1,"Bollinger to de Kock, no run on line this time, de Kock hops back and defends from the crease"
2,"Bollinger to de Kock, OUT got him, extra pace and bounce and de Kock feathers through to Dunk! Nothing stroke from de Kock, just hung his bat out - but the ball fair zipped through off the surface, seamed a fraction, took a small but visible deflection off the edge and South Africa are one down"
3,"Bollinger to Rossouw, no run back of a length, shuffles across and defends safely down on to the pitch"
4,"Bollinger to Rossouw, no run Bollinger is hammering in, hitting the deck hard and this flies through above shoulder height as Rossouw swats wildly at it - Dougie thought there may have been some glove involved, but no. Took a superb leap from Dunk to snag it"
5,"Bollinger to Rossouw, FOUR runs lofted straight down the ground, four more! Length ball from Bollinger and although Rossouw swung across the line, he managed to bisect mid-on and mid-off with a leading edge and again the ball scoots away"
6,"Faulkner to Hendricks, no run pitched up from over the wicket, around off stump, watchfully defended by Hendricks"
7,"Faulkner to Hendricks, 1 run full and straight, this is clipped of the pads through square for a single"

9,"Faulkner to Rossouw, no run good lines from Faulkner, not offering any width, again Rossouw defends from the crease"

11,"Faulkner to Rossouw, OUT got him, slower ball and this time the leading edge is snaffled by Faulkner! He's a canny lad in this form of the game, Faulkner, although his back-of-the-hand delivery was heading down the leg side. Rossouw was done by the lack of pace, heaved to leg again, the edge ballooned back down the pitch and the bowler clutched it diving to his right"
12,"Bollinger to Hendricks, no run angled across the right-hander, who sits back and steers the ball to backward point on the bounce"
13,"Bollinger to Hendricks, no run on the stumps, Hendricks defends this time"

19,"Faulkner to Duminy, no run length delivery, Duminy comes forward on off stump, tapped into the covers"
20,"Faulkner to Duminy, 1 run pitched up, tempting the drive and Duminy gets a low edge, falls short of keeper and slip... in fact, it bobbles between them and they pinch one"
21,"Faulkner to Hendricks, 1 run chipped back towards mid-off on the bounce and Hendricks takes on the arm, not sure who the fielder was but the throw missed with all three stumps to hit. Actually, Hendricks was in anyway"
22,"Faulkner to Duminy, 1 run on the stumps, worked into a gap in the leg side for one"
23,"Faulkner to Hendricks, no run good length, straightens a touch off the angle, Hendricks is hit on the padding and Faulkner asks the questions - possibly too high"
24,"Abbott to Duminy, FOUR runs bit of width, Duminy rattles the hands through a rapier cut stroke and the ball flashes to the boundary"
25,"Abbott to Duminy, no run swing and miss this time, little bit of extra bounce for Abbott and the ball zips through"
26,"Abbott to Duminy, 1 run on the stumps, worked across the line to the leg side for another quick single"
27,"Abbott to Hendricks, no run good lines, Hendricks is struggling to work the ball around here, blocked back down the pitch"
28,"Abbott to Hendricks, FOUR runs oh, me and my mouth... this is crumped through midwicket, who could smell the freshly mown hay, that was so agricultural but it brings Hendricks four, shuffling back and roundhousing four"

33,"Bollinger to Duminy, 1 run fuller and sliding on to the pads, Duminyn nibbles one more through backward square"
34,"Bollinger to Hendricks, 1 run good length on middle and leg, closes the face and works into a gap at midwicket, Maxwell scampers across to keep them to a single"
35,"Bollinger to Duminy, FOUR runs lovely stroke from JP, leans into a slightly overpitched delivery and spanks it straight back down the ground for four"
36,"Maxwell to Hendricks, FOUR runs starts around the wicket, full and outside off and Hendricks drives, gets a thick edge wide of the keeper for a couple"
37,"Maxwell to Hendricks, 1 run tossed up, drifting across the right-hander, who plinks one into a gap at cover"
38,"Maxwell to Duminy, 1 run flat trajectory, on middle and off stump, Duminy begins to close the face and gets a leading edge through mid-off"
39,"Maxwell to Hendricks, no run pushes this through a bit quicker, extra bounce beats the bat as Hendricks chops at it"
40,"Maxwell to Hendricks, no run floated up on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"

47,"Cummins to Duminy, no run pitched up a fraction wide, Duminy reaches for the drive and finds the diving Maxwell equal to it at backward point again - a precious maiden for Postman Pat, who delivers again"
48,"Faulkner to Duminy, 1 run steps to leg and shovels through midwicket as Faulkner follows him with the ball"
49,"Faulkner to Miller, 1 run pitched up on middle and leg, flicked fine but they don't manage a second, think Miller slipped when turning"
50,"Faulkner to Duminy, SIX runs fetch that! Length ball from Faulkner and Duminy finally sends one over the ropes, meaty swing to leg and the ball sailed h-i-i-i-i-i-g-h over deep square leg"
51,"Faulkner to Duminy, 1 run slightly shorter, goes for the pull to leg again, gets a single to long-on"
52,"Faulkner to Miller, FOUR runs sliced and beyond the fingertips of backward point! Miller threw the hands at that, just managed to clear the man and it runs away for four"
53,"Faulkner to Miller, OUT scooped high into the leg side, there's a man under this... gottim! Miller's time is up, aiming for the same boundary that Duminy cleared a few balls ago, got under it but didn't have the distance, taken comfortably a few yards in from the fence"
54,"Cummins to McLaren, 1 run length ball, little bit of width and McLaren swings hard, gets a thick edge down to third man"
55,"Cummins to Duminy, 1 run short and swatted through midwicket for another single"
56,"Cummins to McLaren, no run slightly back of a length outside off stump, attempted steer to third man misses out"

58,"Cummins to McLaren, OUT another short ball, McLaren takes this one... and top edges to fine leg running in! This is pretty ordinary from South Africa, they're now six down and Cummins has the wicket he deserves.

59,"Cummins to Duminy, 1 run touch short of a length, runs a single to third man"
60,"Boyce to Hendricks, no run lovely delivery to begin with, flighted and straightening to slip past the outside edge as Hendricks plays forward"
61,"Boyce to Hendricks, 1 run a touch straighter, Henricks waits on it and pushes a single into the leg side"
62,"Boyce to Duminy, 1 run tossed up on the stumps, leans over the ball and flicks to the leg side"
63,"Boyce to Hendricks, OUT done him, Hendricks is down the river and stumped without a paddle! Superb work from Boyce, lured the batsman out but the ball dipped and he was nowhere near the pitch, just enough spin to go past the outside edge and he had no chance of regaining his ground"
64,"Boyce to Behardien, no run flighted, nice and straight, clumped towards mid-on and there's all sorts going on here! The ball bounces short of Faulkner but he snatches it and fires off a throw, Duminy is way down the pitch... but Boyce tries to deflect the ball on to the stumps first time, rather than collect it, which he had time to do"

72,"Faulkner to Duminy, 2 runs pitched up, nicely timed back down the ground and they get two as long-on jogs across to cut it off"

74,"Faulkner to Duminy, 2 runs on the stumps, squeezes one out into the leg side"
75,"Faulkner to Duminy, OUT Duminy hoicks a fullish ball high towards wide long-off - but it's taken on the run by Finch! The Aussies are waltzing here, they've nipped out the SA captain and still the score is below 100. The umpires checked for the no-ball but he had a smidge of rubber behind the line"

77,"Faulkner to Parnell, no run back of a length, again can't get it away"

80,"Cummins to Parnell, no run back of a length, flying through over the stumps, Parnell leans back and fails to connect"
81,"Cummins to Parnell, 1 run slower ball from Cummins this time, room for Parnell to swing the arms, chops one through mid-off"
82,"Cummins to Abbott, 1 run length ball on middle stump, Abbott drives off the back foot, Cameron White picks it up to his left at extra cover, swivels and throws... a direct hit would do it but the ball bounces safely by. That's the Saffer 100 up"
83,"Cummins to Parnell, 1 run in the blockhole and Parnell manages to club another single back past the bowler - Cummins and Australia won't mind that, they've managed to limit South Africa to just 101"
84,"If you're African, it's been a grim hour or so, as Zimbabwe managed to toss away the second Test against Bangladesh too. Anyway, I'll be back in 15... Don't go anywhere."
85,"9.05pm: Well, just the ten boundaries tells most of the story for South Africa, who have lurched back into familiar territory when it comes to T20 in Oz. They'll want to put that performance in Room 101, though Cummins and Boyce, in particular, bowled superbly. SA will have to supersize their bowling effort from Adelaide if they're going to match that maiden victory and clinch the series - however, only once has a team defended a lower score than 101 from"

111,"Duminy to Finch, FOUR runs flatter, on the stumps, crunched back down the ground again, not the cleanest strike but it beats a rather feeble effort from long-on running across"

113,"Parnell to Dunk, no run shortish and Dunk miscues a pull along the ground to midwicket"
