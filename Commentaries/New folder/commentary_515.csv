1,"Broad to Paine, no run fuller and attacking the top of off. Dabbed into the leg side and they scamper through"
2,"Broad to Paine, 1 run overpitched a fraction outside off, pushed into the covers and they turn down a risky two. Ponting glares at Paine for a hesitant call"
3,"Broad to Ponting, no run back and across, and defended to midwicket"
4,"Broad to Ponting, 1 wide oops, that's a bit misdirected. Wa-ay down the leg side"
5,"Broad to Ponting, no run outside off this time, Ponting unfurls his best Test-match leave-alone to usher that one through. Bat high, front knee bent, you know the drill"
6,"Broad to Ponting, FOUR runs cracking strike to finish the over, just enough width and Ponting leathers it off the back foot, through the covers. No stopping that"

35,"Anderson to Ponting, no run drawn forward on a good length, pushed into the covers"

37,"Broad to Paine, no run pushed out to cover"
38,"Broad to Paine, no run this one climbs and zips back into the batsman. Good bowling"
39,"Broad to Paine, no run testing times for Paine. The back-of-a-length tactics are cramping his style"

41,"Broad to Ponting, no run solidly forward, pushed up to cover"

44,"Wright to White, no run good length, a fraction too wide, but left safely alone"

71,"Wright to Paine, no run short again, and Paine pulls without conviction. Midwicket fields"

96,"Wright to Paine, 1 run Paine opens the face and guides it more certainly down to third man again"

248,"Tait to Strauss, no run Tait starts with a loosener... that spits up savagely off a length outside off at more than 90mph. Strauss drops the hands and gets out of the way of that thunderbolt"
249,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide very quick again, but misdirected down the leg side this time and called wide"
250,"Tait to Strauss, 1 leg bye Strauss didn't quite pick this one up, but he takes it on the thigh pad and Kieswetter calls him through for a quick single"
251,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run absolute gem from Tait! Sharp swing away from the bat, late and at high pace. Kieswetter pushes at it, but that was too good to even get an edge on"
252,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run beaten again! Slightly fuller this time, but the swing is there again and the ball zips past the outside edge"
253,"Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run back of a length this time, Kieswetter gets into some difficulty as he fends to leg, the ball pops up but falls safely"
254,"Tait to Strauss, no run full and swinging, but Strauss presents the full face of the bat to defend"
255,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run good start, outside off and there's a touch of swing back in to Kieswetter, though it's wide enough to leave alone"
256,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run tapped defensively back down the wicket off the back foot"
257,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 run too straight, and the swing in to the right-hander takes it towards leg stump. Kieswetter nudges to midwicket and they set off immediately"
258,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 wide short and wide outside off, you'd back Strauss to cash in on those every time but some extra bounce and movement away from him means the ball loops past the edge. Too far outside off, that's a wide"
259,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run big swing from Bollinger! Strauss is drawn forward into an optimistic drive but massive, hooping movement away from him means he misses by a good few inches"
260,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run he's expecting it to move now, and as Bollinger sends one down on a length outside off Strauss just pulls the bat inside the line"
261,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run beaten on the outside edge! In the channel outside off, close enough that Strauss had to play this time, but the movement takes the ball past the edge."
262,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run full, fast and swinging, but Kieswetter drives nicely to mid-off. Beaten for pace though, he only moved forward after the shot had already been played"
263,"Tait to Kieswetter, 2 runs banged in short, ball hits bat as Kieswetter tries to hook but luckily for him it loops safely behind square leg"
264,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run full again, punched to cover"
265,"Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run nicely played by Kieswetter, the ball shaped away from him off a length but he got on top of it for a single to third man"
266,"Tait to Strauss, 2 runs Strauss shuffles right across to off stump and clips Tait down to fine leg. The pace on the ball means the fielder has to pull out the dive to cut it off"
267,"Tait to Strauss, no run feisty! Well-directed bouncer on middle and off, Strauss buckles the knees to get underneath it. Phew! That's nasty"
268,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run Kieswetter has a huge swipe to the first ball, which is full outside off, and misses completely"
269,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run now he's hit one! Middles a drive, but straight to cover. Sharp fielding there, it was really well struck"
270,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run squirted defensively to gully off the front foot"
271,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run after swinging a couple away from the bat, he gets one to jag in off the seam. Kieswetter is hurried in defence, and the ball shoots off the inner half of the bat to midwicket"
272,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run solid defensive stroke to backward point. That hit the middle, nice crack of bat on ball"
273,"Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs short and sharp from Tait, but he's offered width outside off and Strauss uppercuts down to third man. Such was the pace on the ball, it landed just inside the boundary rope!"
274,"Tait to Strauss, no run slower ball, but slips out a full toss outside off and Strauss taps to mid-off"
275,"Tait to Strauss, OUT clatter! That's the dismissal every fast bowler wants to see! Tait fires one in on a length, gets some nice shape in to the left-hander to beat his defensive poke and smash into the top of the off stump. That's a real sta"
276,"Tait to Yardy, 4 byes cuts him in half! I don't think Yardy even saw that, it was right through him before he could even get the bat down. Paine is done by the speed too, and that runs down to fine leg!"
277,"Tait to Yardy, 1 wide speared down the leg side, that's a wide. So Yardy will have to face up to that delivery again..."
278,"Tait to Yardy, OUT nope. I don't know what the thinking was sending Yardy in to face Tait, but it really hasn't worked. Tait fires one in fuller and Yardy simply leaves it - I don't think he quite picked the ball up - and the ball smashes int"
279,"Tait to PD Collingwood, 3 runs woah! Full and fast, Colly jams the bat down just in time to keep the ball out, and sends the ball into the gap on the leg side"
280,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full and wide outside off, swinging away and left alone by Collingwood"
281,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood pushes leaden-footed at a length delivery outside off and is well beaten"
282,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run and again, Harris shapes the ball away to beat the edge of Collingwood's prod. To the batsman's credit, he didn't push at the ball, just played the line"
283,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 3 runs too straight from Harris, and Collingwood nurdles one right out of the middle down to the midwicket boundary. Long boundary there, so a tough chase for the fielder, who does eventually haul it in"
284,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run quick yorker from Harris, Kieswetter does well to keep it out"
285,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run banged in outside off, Kieswetter whips his bat out of the way and leaves well alone"
286,"Tait to PD Collingwood, 2 runs on a length, but just too straight and Collingwood goes back and across, very deep in the crease, to work the ball away behind square on the leg side"
287,"Tait to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs even at Tait's pace, you can't afford to dish up a delivery like that. Ful and wide, and slapped past backward point for four"
288,"Tait to PD Collingwood, SIX runs pulled infront of square for six! That was anything but a nurdle, Tait drops short and Collingwood just rocks back and scythes through the line to send the ball sailing over the boundary"
289,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run fuller this time, and the ball is met with the full face of the bat in a defensive stroke"
290,"Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 wide Collingwood shuffles across to off as Tait hurls one down the leg side - that's a wide"
291,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run full and straight, pushed to mid on"
292,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run inside edge squirts just past the stumps and straight to the man at short fine leg! That was mighty close, but no harm done in the end"
293,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run full and punched firmly into the covers"
294,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run just back of a length on off stump, Kieswetter gets on top of the ball and taps to point. Played it right under his eyes"
295,"Harris to Kieswetter, FOUR runs wonderful shot from Kieswetter, textbook cover drive played on the up through cover. Not a half-volley, but cracked right out of the middle with a high left elbow, and he picks the gap perfectly too"
296,"Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs too straight to follow up, and he's flicked down to fine leg where a tumbling stop saves a few runs"
297,"Harris to Kieswetter, OUT leading edge flies to Hussey at extra cover, and Kieswetter departs! Harris had been shaping the ball away from him nicely, and as Kieswetter shaped to clip through midwicket the movement got him into trouble. The ba"
298,"Harris to Morgan, no run full to start, and Morgan taps the ball back to Harris"
299,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run nice start, Bollinger finds some lift outside off to strike the splice of Collingwood's bat"
300,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run same again, although this time Collingwood was expecting the extra bounce and got up on his toes to play the ball down to point"
301,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Bollinger directs one at leg stump and Collingwood rolls his wrists nicely over the ball to send it to the long leg boundary. Nice shot, didn't hit it too hard but got the timing and placement spot on"
302,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run landing just outside off from over the wicket, and Collingwood leaves alone"
303,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run and again, he's done his work for the over and so can leave deliveries in the channel outside off without a worry"
304,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run well, Collingwood wasn't content to just play out the over! He charges down the track to the last ball and aims a massive heave over midwicket. Can't quite connect though, and the ball trickles behind square"
305,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run driven firmly to cover"
306,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run little bit of movement away through the air, Collingwood defends a very full ball somewhat awkwardly and the ball rolls into the off side"
307,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run pushed behind square, but straight to backward point"
308,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run slipping down towards leg stump, that was there to be hit but Collingwood couldn't lay bat on ball. Perhaps beaten slightly for pace as ball strikes pad"
309,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full on off, tapped back to the bowler"
310,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed just to the right of mid on, giving them opportunity for a quick single"
311,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run wobbling around outside off, Collingwood is quite happy to leave alone"
312,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run big appeal from Bollinger as he shapes one back in to the right-hander to strike him on the pad. But it pitched just on leg, and was going way over the top of off, so an optimistic appeal."
313,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run pushed across Collingwood, who pulls his bat out of the way and leaves again"
314,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run full and slightly wider, Collingwood tries a drive but isn't in a great position and the ball skews to cover"
315,"Bollinger to Morgan, no run back of a length outside off, rising nicely up to about chest height and Morgan leaves alone"
316,"Bollinger to Morgan, no run now he gets one to jag in to the left-hander off the seam, and the ball is tapped defensively to point with a hop"
317,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run ball squirts off the inside edge, going to cover as it rebounds off the pad. Morgan wants a run but Collingwood sends him back. A direct hit would've had him there"
318,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run pulls the length back a touch, and Collingwood pushes to cover"
319,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run driven on the up, but again straight to cover"
320,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full and straight this time, Collingwood tries to nurdle to leg but finds mid-on"
321,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run hmm, has that kept low? It was on a length outside off and Collingwood aimed to slash it away, but the ball zipped under the bat"
322,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run tip-and-run to finish the over, as the ball is pushed into the tiniest of gaps at cover and they set off immediately for a single. Nice running"
323,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run much fuller this time, prodded defensively to midwicket, and they take a quick single"
324,"Bollinger to Morgan, 1 wide left-hander messes up the radar as he spears one down the leg side"
325,"Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye sharp yorker! Morgan is struck on the foot to cries of anguish from the Australian fielders, but that was slipping way down leg"
326,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length and straight, Collingwood hops back and across to defend"
327,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run full, and clipped out to deep midwicket. They briefly consider a second"
328,"Bollinger to Morgan, no run on a length, and coming in off the seam. Morgan responds with a solid forward defensive, presenting the full face of a straight bat"
329,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run edged first ball! But that fell just short, and wide, of Watson at slip. Half a chance, but it didn't get to him."
330,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 run nudged gently off the hip, and they charge through for one as Hopes sprints across after his follow-through"
331,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run tapped easily to deep mid-on for an ambled single"

334,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 wide pushed too far down leg, that's a wide"
335,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 run tapped out to wide long-on for another easy single"
336,"Bollinger to Morgan, no run Bollinger bangs one in outside off, Morgan drops his hands and leaves"
337,"Bollinger to Morgan, 4 leg byes sharp bouncer! And perfectly directed, Morgan aimed to hook it up and over fine leg but took his eyes off the ball, which took the top edge and touched the shoulder and the bottom of the helmet, flying up an"
338,"Bollinger to Morgan, no run on a length, seaming in and tucked straight to midwicket"
339,"Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run pushed just between midwicket and the wide mid-on, and they take a sharp single"
340,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off, but not timed"
341,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off once again, a slightly better connection but straight to the fielder"
342,"Hopes to Morgan, no run this is on a good length and line to welcome Morgan back after the break, defended to cover"

344,"Hopes to Morgan, 2 runs follows up the boundary with a neat tickle round the corner for two more"
345,"Hopes to Morgan, no run this would keep the bowler interested, outside off stump and Morgan just let his hands follow the ball"
346,"Hopes to Morgan, OUT gone! What a catch! Morgan nailed a pull shot, smashing it flat towards a straightish midwicket, the Marsh in the deep ran round and dived, juggling the ball as he landed to clasp on to the catch"
347,"Hopes to Pietersen, no run bouncer to greet the new man, outside off and he leaves alone"
348,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run tidy start, gentle spin away Collingwood defends"
349,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run this time Collingwood turns it into the leg side to bring Pietersen on to strike"
350,"Smith to Pietersen, no run Pietersen has to stretch forward first ball, that thigh will get a severe working over"
351,"Smith to Pietersen, no run gets into a good position here, stretching forward and driving crisply to cover"
352,"Smith to Pietersen, OUT gone! Maybe that thigh won't get much of a testing then. It was short and slightly wide, Pietersen went back to cut but ends up with a bottom edge on to his foot which goes on to the stumps leaving England in a bit of"
353,"Smith to Wright, no run Wright defends with an inside edge"
354,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run touch short, Collingwood aims to cut, but can't find any timing"

357,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run Hopes doing a fine job here, Collingwood can't beat the infield"
358,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run once again nothing on offer for Collingwood, he defends quietly"
359,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length to finish, Collingwood defends"
360,"Smith to Wright, 3 runs men at silly mid-off and slip, and so a huge gap at extra cover which Wright finds with a cracking drive. But there is a deep cover, and he cuts if off"
361,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off"
362,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run full and flighted, Collingwood lunges forward to defend"
363,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run very optimistic appeal from 'keeper and bowler as the ball strikes pad, but there was a massive inside edge on that"

365,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched out to deep cover for the single"
366,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood picks up a swift single pushing this full ball to mid on"

374,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run nicely milked down the ground by Collingwood"
375,"Smith to Wright, no run Wright is once again forward and defending. Even Tim Paine, the man with the world's most gentle face, seems to be having a fearful sledge"
376,"Smith to Wright, no run Wright is carefully forward and blocking"
377,"Smith to Wright, 1 run slashed hard into the point region, the pace is taken off by a fielder so it's only one"

398,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run a play and a miss, full and asking for a drive, Collingwood answers the call but can't connect"

431,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run tapped down to long-on for one"
432,"Smith to Wright, OUT Wright slogs sweeps and makes a good connection ... but Shaun Marsh charges round at deep midwicket to take his second superb running catch in the deep. He held this one much more cleanly, and as Smith picks up his secon"
