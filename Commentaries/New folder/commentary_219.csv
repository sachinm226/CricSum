They check the delivery for height but it's just the right side of a no-ball, so the innings finishes with a wicket, Head and Wade's"
246,"5pm: So, South Africa will need 372 to win the match and take the series. However you slice it, that's a tall order. Hundreds for David Warner and Steven Smith provided the sturdiest of bedrock and then the blitz from Head and Wade - who gorged on the death bowling to the tune of 46 from 22 balls - iced a very plump-looking cake. In the process, Dale"

283,"Worrall to Amla, 1 run opens the face and runs it to third man"

533,"Worrall to Miller, SIX runs that's huge!!! Onto the roof at deep square leg. A magnificent pick-up shot off his legs with a effortless swing of the arms. But he was offered length which is very hittable. Still, a humongous blow. Bounced out of the ground by the looks of it"
534,"Zampa to Phehlukwayo, no run swing and a miss outside off, an appeal for a stumping and it goes upstairs...was the googly. Did he keep his foot grounded? Yes, he's well back"

549,"You did think that when de Kock and Rossouw went in quick succession that the task would be too much for South Africa. Remember, too, that Miller picked up an injury early in his innings but he kept his cool so well. He knew he could find the boundary when needed. Has to be said, however, that Australia's fielding fell apart towards the end"
550,South Africa won by 4 wickets (with 4 balls remaining)
551,"Player of the match is David Miller, SA"
