6,"Not for the first time have Australia done this in the recent past. A confident Ponting has declared at 459 for 5, giving New Zealand plenty of overs to face on the second day where he will back his bowlers to make inroads. North remains unbeaten on 112, following up on a stellar innings from Clarke. The conditions are very much in favour of the batsmen, but how will the New Zealand top order cope? Join us in a bit"

38,New Zealand will be devastated as they have shown no back bone on the third day and have been cleaned up by a very clinical display from an amped up Australian pace attack that looks focused and energetic. That is 12.1 overs bowled this morning for 49 runs and 6 wickets. The highlights package is not a pretty sight for the New Zealanders. Ricky Ponting has enforced the follow on and we will see MacIntosh and Watling back at the crease in a
39,Innings Start
40,"Well, Australia will be very happy with a complete performance in this first test match.
