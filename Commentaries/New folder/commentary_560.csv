1,"North to Pietersen, no run straight-bat defence this time"
2,"North to Pietersen, no run drifts onto the pads, it's defended to leg"
3,"North to Pietersen, 1 run worked away to square leg"
4,"North to Strauss, no run well, not with this ball, though it was wide outside off, his cut doesn't beat point"
5,"North to Strauss, no run and driven to mid-off"
6,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run oh, KP almost a brain-freeze there! He's chopped it into the ground and as it bounces up he puts his hand out as if to grab it, then rethinks and leaves it, then thinks about handling it again, then remembers him"
7,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run oh, another close one! He's tried to hook this one and it's flown off the top edge, lobs up behind square, Haddin can't quite get there in time"
8,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 1 run clipped away to square leg and Pietersen will be happy to get off strike there"
9,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run left alone outside off"
10,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 3 runs and there's the hundred for Strauss! He cuts it away behind point, McDonald on the boundary stops the four but three is enough and what a super innings it's been"

12,"North to Strauss, no run outside off and defended"

15,"North to Strauss, 1 run short and clunked off the back foot"
16,"North to Pietersen, 1 run nurdled off his toes"

19,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run driven to mid-on"
20,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off"

22,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run slightly tighter line and a better length"
23,"Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs driven hard back to Siddle, through his hands, through his legs for four. That was a real toe-crusher - from Pietersen, not Siddle - and can barely be described a chance, but nevertheless I'm still going to have t"
24,"North to Strauss, no run wide of the off stump, spinning away from Strauss who ignores it"
25,"North to Strauss, no run crisply driven - fuller delivery"
26,"North to Strauss, 1 run gives this massive amounts of flight - that's got snow on it, surely? Neat drive out to cover"
27,"North to Pietersen, 1 run tickled to leg"
28,"North to Strauss, no run excellent ball - turn and, crucially, bounce for North who beats Strauss's cut. Good take by Haddin"
29,"North to Strauss, no run cut off the back foot"
30,"Siddle to Pietersen, OUT got him! Terrific ball that moved away just a touch from Pietersen, drawn forward into a drive, and it took a thin outside edge to a diving Haddin behind the stumps"

35,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run nudges this to leg to end a very fine, aggressive, wholehearted and successful wicket maiden"
36,"North to Strauss, no run a little teaser outside off, and bowled incredibly slow. Like one of my filth legbreaks, barely breaking the 40mph mark, but that's the key on this pitch - bowl it slow, let it turn"
37,"North to Strauss, 2 runs cut away behind square"
38,"North to Strauss, 1 run waits for it on the back foot, forcing it hard off the back foot past point"

41,"North to PD Collingwood, no run and it's blocked to end the over"

43,"Siddle to Strauss, no run short of a good length, Strauss defends on the back foot with the straightest of bats"
44,"Siddle to Strauss, FOUR runs slashed and dropped by the diving gully - another catch goes down, this one by Mike Hussey. Loose shot by Strauss though he absolutely smashed it, and those are the catches Australia really need to take"
45,"Siddle to Strauss, no run full toss - attempted yorker but didn't quite come out right. He's bowling sharply, here, Siddle - all above 90mph"

53,"North to Strauss, no run ignored outside off"
54,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run very good line in the corridor of uncertainty. That's where to bowl to Collingwood who thought about playing, but left it"

56,"Siddle to Strauss, no run wide of Strauss and left alone"

68,"Siddle to Strauss, 1 run flicked to leg"
69,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 3 runs Australia's V8 engine lets out a frustrated grunt at drifting onto Collingwood's legs, somewhere they really must avoid. Bread, butter and a whole load of similar things - flicked through the leg side"

93,"Johnson to Strauss, 1 leg bye down the leg side and off his pads. Johnson yelps half an appeal but it's miles down the leg side"
94,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run breaking news: swing spotted bending ever so slightly back into Collingwood"
95,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run patted off his pads for a rinky dinky single"
96,"Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up outside off, driven back to the bowler"
97,"Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run skips down the pitch, flicking to leg"

106,"Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs guided, although that might be a generous description, between gully and third slip and it runs away for a boundary"
107,"Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs and that's almost a carbon copy. Prior drives outside off, it flies away behind gully for four more"

115,"Johnson to Strauss, 1 run 80mph or 129kph, Strauss flicks it off his hips to fine-leg"
116,"Johnson to Prior, OUT what a cracker! Johnson has got one to swing back in to the right-hander Prior and it's through the gate, takes off stump. Australia are well and truly back in this!"
117,"Johnson to Flintoff, no run oops, down leg side and Haddin does well to take it"
118,"Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs Flintoff gets off the mark with a lovely clip off his pads through square, but that was another ball that swung in to the right-hander"

124,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run fullish ball, driven to cover"

134,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, OUT gone! The old ball works out for Hilfenhaus. A great outswinger takes the edge of Flintoff's bat and Ponting and second slip snaffles the opportunity"
135,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run inswing, definite shape with the old ball and Broad takes a sharpish blow to the nether-regions"
136,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run good ball again, an off-stump line and swinging in towards middle, it's defended by Broad"

141,"Johnson to Strauss, no run dead straight ball, dead straight-bat defence"
142,"Johnson to Strauss, 3 runs flicked away wristily through midwicket, that's a good shot and in among the wickets Strauss just keeps accumulating"
143,"Johnson to Broad, no run short, just outside off, and Broad leaves it"
144,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run angled across him and left alone"
145,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 2 runs swivels a pull around forward of square"

149,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run nudged away to point for no run"
150,"Johnson to Broad, 3 runs good ball to begin with, a hint of outswing and Broad pushes past point and picks up three as Hauritz chases it down"
151,"Johnson to Strauss, FOUR runs too short this time, and wide outside off, Strauss cuts and makes no effort to keep it down, there's no need to as it flies safely down to the vacant third-man region"
152,"Johnson to Strauss, no run outside off, left alone"
153,"Johnson to Strauss, no run fuller length, Strauss drives to mid-on"

159,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run angled across Strauss, who pokes it to the off-side"
160,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 2 runs and there's the 150 for Strauss, he's picked it up by jamming out a yorker length ball and driving it forward of point"
161,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 1 run drops it into the on-side and they scamper through for a quick single"
162,"Johnson to Strauss, no run oops, that's more the Johnson we've seen today. A full toss down leg side"
163,"Johnson to Strauss, no run short ball now, Strauss sways out of the way"
164,"Johnson to Strauss, no run good ball, shortish outside off and Strauss looks to defend then gets the bat out of the way in time"
165,"Johnson to Strauss, 1 run angled in to the pads, Strauss clips it to square leg"
166,"Johnson to Broad, no run on the back foot, clunking a drive out to cover"

168,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run outside off stump and left alone"
169,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, FOUR runs good shot, fullish ball and Strauss watches it wonderfully, drives through cover and that's just a clean, risk-free stroke that epitomises his innings"

176,"Johnson to Broad, no run good line this time, no swing though, and Broad gets in behind it to defend"
177,"Johnson to Broad, no run some sharp bounce late in the day here, Broad gets out of the way"
178,"Johnson to Broad, no run that's the slower one, but it's down leg side and no contact is made"
179,"Johnson to Broad, no run handled comfortably by Broad, who blocks it in front of off stump"
180,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run starts with a really stiff loosener, wide of the off stump"
181,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, OUT GOT HIM! Strauss leaves one which bends back - a disastrous leave from the England captain and his off stump is pegged back. What a start for Australia!"
182,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run straighter delivery on the middle stump"
183,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run nice, encouraging shape away from the right-handed Swann who leaves it alone"
184,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run too wide and left alone"
185,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs juicy. On his legs and beautifully clipped for four, though he will need to be wary of the one which straightens on him. Too full from Hilfenhaus though"

187,"Siddle to Broad, no run angles across him but it's a bit too wide"

192,"Siddle to Anderson, no run snorter! An absolute cracker from Siddle which flew off a length past Broad's outside edge"
193,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs on his legs, pulled fine for four. Well played. Runs are suddenly at an absolute premium and much rests on Broad"
194,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run that's a good leave to a ball wide of the off stump. No great movement back into the left-hander this time"
195,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run short of a length and whipped to leg but he can't time it"
196,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run this one holds its line outside off. Broad leaves alone"
197,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs yowzers, that was close! Broad flung his bat a fuller delivery outside off and got a monstrous inside edge which nearly took out his stumps"
198,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, OUT bowled him! Three in fifteen minutes for Australia as Broad again attempts a loose drive outside off and drags it on"

208,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run"
209,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run nasty, horrid short ball - very, very well bowled indeed - but Anderson plays this well, jumping up and getting his hands high to fend the ball down"
210,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run an extravagant flay out to the off side"
211,"Siddle to Onions, no run sharp, shortish delivery to Onions who, on the back foot, defends it nervously, getting a thick inside edge to his pads"

213,"Siddle to Onions, 2 runs Onions squeezes it past point for a single"
214,"Siddle to Onions, (no ball) well he might be ill, but Siddle's bowled a beauty here that crashes into Onions' helmet"

216,"Siddle to Onions, no run left alone outside off"
217,"Siddle to Onions, no run a little too short and left alone"
218,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 3 runs good delivery - good thinking, at least - angling this across the left-hander but Anderson's played it nicely, guiding it past point for a single"
219,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, FOUR runs bosh! Great stroke from Onions, slapping this past point off the back foot - almost an orthodox square cut, save for the fact he's a tail-ender. Still - an encouraging and crowd-cheering blow"
220,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run short, wide and pushed out to the off side"
221,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run ah, well bowled - almost too much movement for Hilfenhaus here, as the ball bent away markedly on the right-hander who, with tail-end jollity, tried to fling it over the slips and missed"
222,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run so close! Terrific line from Hilfenhaus - the pick of Australia's bowlers in the series thus far, comfortably - and Onions again rather cluelessly flapped and missed"
223,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run full enough to drive, so he does drive and gets a single out to McDonald at deep extra cover"
224,"Johnson to Onions, 1 run little nudge to midwicket and they steal a single. Johnson's sick as a parrot - can't believe they stole a single"

226,"Johnson to Onions, no run down the leg side"

228,"Johnson to Anderson, no run fuller delivery, nicely bowled, but nicely defended too - pushed out quite crisply to the off side"
229,"Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs pressure on Johnson! Superb back-foot drive, elegantly driven past point to send a packed Lord's crowd into delirium. Nothing like a tailender boshing quick runs"
230,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run Onions! He's gone for a highly ambitious Viv Richards-esque pull on the front foot, but finds mid-on - who flings in a throw but it's wide! More runs for England"

233,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run ooh, full and swinging away from Onions who drives and misses"

235,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, 2 runs lifts this over extra cover! Onions on fire here (sorry)"
236,"Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs take that. Superb stroke, but another poor delivery from Johnson - just too full and much, much too wide. Anderson steps back, rocks back, and flangs it through extra cover"
237,"Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs Johnson tries to correct his line but it's much too straight, this time, and it's down the leg side for four more!"
238,"Johnson to Anderson, no run short of a length and hurries into the rib-cage area of Anderson who tucks it to leg"
239,"Johnson to Anderson, no run back of a length and again nicely defended by a steely eyed Anderson, defending on the back foot and down by his toes. Boycott will be proud"
240,"Johnson to Anderson, no run again short, targetting his chest and Anderson is back and defending"
241,"Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs four more - and that's a very clever shot indeed. Short, wide - awful, frankly, from Johnson - and uppercut over backward point for four more"
242,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run defended out to cover, defended very solidly"
243,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run beaten outside off - moved away just enough to beat the shaky technique of Onions"
244,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run on that's unfairly close, it really is! An inch, no more, from taking Onions' outside edge"
245,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run these are too good for Onions. He plays and misses to another outswinger"
246,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run fuller and Onions gets in line, defending it solidly this time"
247,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run outside off, he shuffles back to defend"
248,"Johnson to Anderson, 1 run steps to leg and flicks this behind square. Misfield from fine leg but they don't think about two"
249,"Johnson to Onions, 1 run slashed hard - catch that! But no, it flies short of third man"
250,"Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs what a shot! Anderson is playing quite brilliantly here, driving on the up and opening the face. Deep backward point hasn't a hope. Class from Anderson"
251,"Johnson to Anderson, OUT got him this time! Got big on him and square cut it low to gully who took a fine catch"
252,"End of innings Good knock from Anderson there, and that's England's innings. They were looking for 450+ and though they'll be disappointed, 425 is still a decent score. More importantly, the ball is moving considerably this morning and their bowlers -"
253,"Mid on, mid off, fine leg - and the rest of the fieldsmen are in an arc from the keeper to point"
254,"Anderson to Ponting, no run there's a bit of outswing, though it's left alone by Ponting"
255,"Anderson to Ponting, no run no shot offered once again"
256,"Anderson to Ponting, no run Ponting lunges forward this time and pushes with purpose, but straight to point"
257,"Anderson to Ponting, 2 runs and the captain is away with a confident drive wide of cover, though it wasn't quite timed as he may have liked"

375,"Onions to Katich, no run left alone outside off this time, Prior drops the take, which is probably something of a contradiction"
376,"Onions to Katich, no run tempting, tempting outside off and Katich chastises himself for chasing that one, it was wide outside off, moving away and he's lucky his slash didn't connect"

383,"Broad to Hussey, no run another bouncer, this time Hussey leaves it and Prior makes a terrific grab hurling himself to his left"
384,"Broad to Hussey, FOUR runs a bouncer, predictably, but that's a magnificent pull from Hussey, he gets over it and hammers it forward of midwicket, it wasn't that wide of a diving Pietersen in the deep but it was struck with such force that he c"

441,"Flintoff to Hussey, no run good one. Short and straight, zeroing in on his heart"
442,"Flintoff to Hussey, no run squeezed out off a thick outside edge. Superb stop by a diving Pietersen at point"

449,"Anderson to North, no run on the off stump and driven with confidence out to cover"
450,"Flintoff to Haddin, no run big shout as Flintoff cuts this back in, but that'll be too high, surely. And yes, it's given not out, but Flintoff's bowling like the wind here - heavy, nasty deliveries"
451,"Flintoff to Haddin, FOUR runs he's timed the leather off that! What a superb off-drive from Haddin, standing tall and holding the pose with a terrific, classy shot. This guy is a serious bat"
452,"Flintoff to Haddin, no run shuffles back, gets right in line"

465,"Flintoff to Haddin, (no ball) jumps back and defends"
466,"Flintoff to Haddin, 3 runs that hurried him! Even on the back foot, Haddin had to jab down on it late and flick it through midwicket. Timed it well"
