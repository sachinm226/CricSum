0,5.05pm Australia have won the toss and will bat.
1,"Fernando to Warner, no run Fernando starts with a good ball, quick and short of a length, Warner jumps back to defend"
2,"Fernando to Warner, 1 run short ball and Warner hooks it through square leg, but doesn't time it, he was surprised by the extra pace"
3,"Fernando to Clarke, no run another very fast bouncer! Great start from Fernando, and Clarke's attempted hook misses"
4,"Fernando to Clarke, 1 run almost played on! Clarke gets a thick inside edge past the stumps and down to fine leg to get off the mark"
5,"Fernando to Warner, no run swing and a miss! Fernando gives Clarke a bit of width outside off, and it's a slower ball, Warner's airy drive doesn't connect"
6,"Fernando to Warner, no run beaten, this one sails over the stumps and Warner's cross-bat shot doesn't connect"
7,"Malinga to Clarke, no run Clarke drives but mistimes and can't beat mid on"
8,"Malinga to Clarke, (no ball) oops! That's a chest-high full toss from Malinga, which is a scary prospect, but it was well down leg and the slower ball, which came out of the hand all wrong"
9,"Malinga to Clarke, 1 run nudge and run stuff from Clarke, he prods to cover and takes off for a quick single"
10,"Malinga to Warner, 1 wide well wide of off stump, David Warner couldn't reach that and it's called a wide"
11,"Malinga to Warner, no run that's a crunching drive from Warner, a 142kph half-volley from Malinga, but the batsman couldn't beat Murali at mid off"

13,"Malinga to Warner, 1 run that's the slower one from Malinga, Warner waits on it and drives to long off"
14,"Fernando to Clarke, no run crunched off the bat and Mathews at point makes a great save"

16,"Fernando to Clarke, FOUR runs and there's the first boundary of the innings, Clarke gets one just short of a length and pulls confidently through midwicket, where there is quite a gap"
17,"Fernando to Clarke, no run good ball, very good inswinging yorker at 143kph and Clarke keeps it out"

31,"Perera to Clarke, OUT what a catch! Dilhara Fernando has just plucked an incredible take over his head! Clarke backed away and tried to slam it over the bowler's head, Fernando running back from mid-on had totally misjudged it and it seemed to be sailing over his head, but at the last minute"

43,"Perera to Hussey, 1 run Hussey waits on this and opens the face to guide it behind point"
44,"Randiv to Hussey, OUT Randiv strikes first ball! Hussey looks to cut but is surprised by the bounce from Randiv's topspinner, an edge is well taken by Sangakkara. This is really unravelling for Australia."

46,"Randiv to White, 1 run this one drifts down leg side, White glances and gets off the mark"

61,"Randiv to White, 1 run powerful sweep from White, but straight to the man at deep square leg"
62,"Malinga to White, OUT Malinga strikes first ball! Short and wide, White's eyes light up but the extra bounce surprises him, his cut turns into a thin edge through to Sangakkara"
63,"Malinga to Smith, no run edged and just short of slip, who has come in for the new batsman. Gosh, that could so easily have gone to hand!"
64,"Malinga to Smith, no run good yorker, swinging it back in a touch, and Malinga wants an lbw but that was sliding down leg"

71,"Randiv to Smith, 1 run Smith sweeps, safely in the air but there's a sweeper in the deep"
72,"Randiv to Haddin, FOUR runs great shot! Haddin has struck what is, incredibly, the third boundary of the innings, a proper straight drive that comes off the middle of the bat and beats long on and long off, who converge in their attempts to cut it off"
73,"Randiv to Haddin, 2 runs late cut this time, well played Haddin, but Australia need a lot more from him to turn this into a competitive total"
74,"Malinga to Haddin, 2 runs tries for the yorker and it turns into a low full toss on the pads, Haddin glances it away and Fernando at short fine leg knocks it down without stopping it properly"
75,"Malinga to Haddin, 1 run pushed to mid-on, Murali picks up and shies at the non-striker's end but there wasn't a run-out on there"
76,"Malinga to Smith, FOUR runs super shot! Smith gets down to lift that over his shoulder with a ramp shot, fine leg was up in the circle so that one sailed safely down towards the boundary, really clever batting"

90,"Perera to Smith, 1 run driven down the ground this time"
91,"Perera to Haddin, 2 runs this time it's Haddin who throws the bat, his heave becomes a top edge that slices over gully and lands safely"

93,"Murali to Haddin, 1 wide wrong line, down leg side and called a wide"
94,"Murali to Haddin, FOUR runs ah, a bit of good fortune for Haddin, who looks to sweep through square leg and just gets a little under-edge that races away to fine leg"
95,"Murali to Haddin, no run run-out chance goes begging - Haddin cuts late and is turned back going for the quick single, the under-arm throw to Sangakkara is too wide and a diving Haddin makes his ground"
96,"Murali to Haddin, no run Haddin goes back into his crease and clips to midwicket"

98,"Murali to Haddin, no run defended away safely"
99,"Malinga to Hastings, 1 wide short and fast, Hastings hasn't much idea about that and lets it go through to Sangakkara. Oh, that's been called a wide, that's simply not the right decision, it was only head height"
100,"Malinga to Hastings, 1 run good yorker, Hastings keeps it out and jabs a single to mid on"
101,"Malinga to McKay, no run punched to mid off, McKay can't beat the field, good full bowling from Malinga"
102,"Malinga to McKay, 1 wide oops, down leg side and that's justifiably called a wide"
103,"Malinga to McKay, 1 run shortish and at the body, McKay tries to pull and it's much quicker onto him than he expected, does get bat on ball though and lobs a single to square leg"
104,"Malinga to Hastings, 1 run slower ball, Hastings picks it and pushes a single to cover, Kapugedera shies at the bowler's end and misses, that would have been a run out"
105,"Malinga to McKay, no run slower ball, and it's a swing and a miss as McKay tries to slam it back over the bowler's head"
106,"Malinga to McKay, 1 wide down leg side again, even further this time and that's the third wide of the over"

108,"Fernando to Hastings, 2 runs Hastings backs away and gets that one off the toe of the bat over point, picks up a couple of handy runs"
109,"Fernando to Hastings, 1 run shorter and at the body, Hastings guides it off the face of the bat to third man"
110,"Fernando to McKay, 1 run McKay backs off and drives hard down the ground, but long off cuts it off easily"
111,"Fernando to Hastings, FOUR runs very useful runs! Hastings backs away and slashes hard, a thick outside edge flies away to third man for a boundary"
112,"Fernando to Hastings, FOUR runs oh, good batting from Hastings, again he's backed away and this time Fernando follows the batsman, but fine leg is up and Hastings flicked that one through the gap and safely away to the boundary"
113,"Fernando to Hastings, 1 run, OUT crunched through cover and the batsmen come back for an ambitious two, the throw finds Hastings short diving back into his ground, he's unselfishly run out trying for that final run"
114,"So, Australia have finished with 133, which is below par on what should be a good batting pitch. Sri Lanka bowled and fielded really well, Randiv and Perera were the standouts. Haddin and Smith got Australia back in the contest, but they'll need a super bowling effort to defend this total. Join us"
115,"The Australians are out on the field, Peter Siddle is warming up for his first ball in an international match since January. But it's Clint McKay to bowl the first over from the Prindiville Stand End."
116,"""Big comeback from Australia and they might just about have an outside chance now, if they bowl well. Hastings and McKay will be keys, as Sri Lanka won't have faced them. If they can bowl well, Sri Lanka could be bowled out,"" Adrian Meredith writes."
117,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run wide of off, Jayawardene tries to cut and crunches it down into the ground"
118,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run oh, good ball, that one nips back in and beats the inside edge of Mahela, who was wafting a long way away from his body"
119,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run beaten again! Well wide of off, Jayawardene launches a big aggressive drive and can't make contact"
120,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run driven to cover, Warner does the fielding and prevents a single"
121,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide bouncer! That one sails over the head of Jayawardene and it's high enough to be called a wide, Sri Lanka are off the mark"
122,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run good length from McKay, Jayawardene nudges to mid on and takes off for a quick single"
123,"McKay to Dilshan, no run beaten outside off again! As it was in Australia's first few overs, Sri Lanka are struggling to pick the bounce"
124,"Nannes to Mahela Jayawardene, no run yorker wide of off to begin, it's jammed away to cover and Warner hurls himself to his left and saves the run, great fielding"
125,"Nannes to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs that's a good cut, Nannes bangs it in short and Jayawardene waits for it, slashes that over backward point and there's nobody in the deep there"
126,"Nannes to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run angled bat from Mahela, he guides it to third man"
127,"Nannes to Dilshan, FOUR runs another boundary, Dilshan clips it confidently through midwicket and finds the gap, Nannes has to find the right line pretty quickly here"
128,"Nannes to Dilshan, no run sharp bounce! That was quick and was on the rise as it got to Haddin, who did very well to get his right hand up to save four byes there"
129,"Nannes to Dilshan, FOUR runs more runs! Great cover drive finds the gap and that's a wonderful over for Sri Lanka"

131,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs another boundary through cover, this time Mahela crunched it lower but still through the gap, perfect placement"
132,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run he goes for the hook this time and that's skied towards fine leg, half a chance for Nannes but he can't get in there in time and it lands safely"
133,"McKay to Dilshan, (no ball) nudged into the turf and to slip and it's a no-ball, so here comes a free hit"
134,"McKay to Dilshan, 1 run shortish and he goes for a hefty pull, the top edge is taken by Haddin but it was a free hit, just a single"
135,"McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run turned around to fine leg for a single"
136,"McKay to Dilshan, no run slower ball turned to square leg, they think about a single but wisely decide against it"
137,"Siddle to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs good ball but what a magnificent shot! It was straight, on a good length and Jayawardene stepped back and punched it between the bowler and mid-off, it's raced away for a boundary. What a stroke!"

147,"Siddle to Sangakkara, no run beaten outside off, angling across the left-hander"
148,"Siddle to Sangakkara, 2 leg byes ah, down leg side and Sangakkara gets some pad on that, Haddin's dive can't stop it but Dirk Nannes manages to cut that one off at fine leg, though he gets himself in a tangle in doing so and the ball somehow ends up up his left trouser leg"
149,"Siddle to Sangakkara, 1 run nudged to midwicket for a quick single"
150,"Siddle to Dilshan, FOUR runs smashed! Positively thumped over midwicket with a strong pull, there's nobody out in the deep there and Dilshan gets another four"

177,"McKay to Dilshan, no run good delivery, nibbling away from the right-hander, and it beats his edge"

211,"McKay to Sangakkara, no run bouncer, Sangakkara ducks underneath it"
212,"McKay to Sangakkara, no run shorter length, and that's a bit comical as it bounces ever so slowly off the wicket and Sangakkara waits and waits, then leaves it alone. It was 100kph."
213,"McKay to Sangakkara, no run nudged away defensively to the off side"
214,"McKay to Sangakkara, no run again he drops it at his feet, remarkably that's a maiden over from McKay"
215,"Smith to Perera, SIX runs massive! That's easily the biggest six of the match, Perera has launched that one over long-on, just got to the pitch of the ball and then used all his muscle"
216,"Smith to Perera, FOUR runs he goes for it again, this time doesn't time the ball but gets enough on it that it sails over mid on and bounces away to the boundary"
217,"Smith to Perera, SIX runs what a way to finish the match! Perera has skied an even bigger six over long-on! It really was a huge six, that's sailed about 20 rows back. Sri Lanka have won, and easily"
218,"That's it for tonight - thanks for joining us. Well played, Sri Lanka!"
219,"Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been here in Australia warming up for more than a week and it's done them no harm. They will be a handful for the hosts in the one-day series, which starts at the MCG on Wednesday."
220,"So, Australia's massive summer of cricket has started on a negative note for the home team. They fielded a slightly weakened side, with Michael Hussey and Mitchell Johnson rested. But this won't do their confidence any good heading in to the three ODIs against Sri Lanka and then, of course, the As"
221,"That's a comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka, they really did outplay Australia for the whole match. Early wickets had the Australians on the ropes and Randiv and Perera in particular ensured the target wasn't too high; then Sangakkara and Dilshan guided the chase."
222,Sri Lanka won by 7 wickets (with 21 balls remaining)
223,"Player of the match is Suraj Randiv, SL"
