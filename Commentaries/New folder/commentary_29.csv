133,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 leg bye length, he shuffles across to the off side and gets struck on the pads in trying to flick. Bumrah wanted to appeal this vociferously, but the line and height might have gone against him"

135,"Bumrah to Carey, no run length, and he runs this towards point"

144,"Jadeja to Carey, no run looks for the reverse sweep again. Misses on contact, with a ball fired outside off (effectively leg). Jadeja wants a caught-behind in his favour. Not given, and India also refuse to refer this"

156,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run sweeps from outside off towards long leg to retain strike"
157,"Saini to Carey, FOUR runs top shot! Full ball, and he drives this like a bullet through extra cover. Holds the pose for the shutterbugs"

168,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run loops one outside off in the air, in going for the slog sweep! Got absolutely no timing on it, and it lands limply around the mid-wicket region, with no fielder in the immediate vicinity. Lucky Carey on this occasion"

222,"Shami to Smith, OUT Smith holes out to deep midwicket! Tried to play a similar shot to that flick that went for six a couple of overs ago and Iyer completes a brilliant catch charging in and diving forward. Big wicket, that, could lop about 20-25 runs off the score, potentially."
223,"Shami to Agar, 2 runs guided through the on-side field, and comes back for two. He needs to play a big part here"
224,"Shami to Agar, 1 run inswinging yorker, that's the ball he needs to bowl as much of as possible. Agar can do little but run it off the face and take the single"
225,"Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball."
226,"Shami to Zampa, no run Zampa tamely drives it through the covers. Surprised Shami didn't go for the yorker again"
227,"Shami to Zampa, no run driven back. Splendid over. 3 runs and 2 wickets."
228,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now?"

240,"Shami to Finch, 3 runs excellent shot. Just a jab, really, and it beat mid-off and absolutely raced down the ground. The outfield looks especially fast, and it takes all the athleticism of Virat Kohli to save one run and keep it from going to the boundary"
241,"Shami to Smith, 1 leg bye moves across, strikes him on the pads. big appeal from Shami, but it was much too high"
242,"Shami to Finch, no run defended back to the bowler"

250,"Saini to Smith, no run gets behind the line to drive it back to the bowler"
251,"Saini to Smith, no run drives on the up to mid-off. Saini's bowling especially well"

253,"Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye angled down leg side, flicked off the pad"
254,"Shami to Smith, no run fidgety from Smith, a bit hurried but flicks it neatly to square leg"
255,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs short ball from Shami, but at 136, it doesn't bother Smith much. Moves across and has an almighty hook at it. Uppish, but beats the infielder as well as fine leg"
256,"Shami to Smith, no run driven into the offside"
257,"Shami to Smith, OUT a mix-up and Australia pay for it with a wicket. Finch gone! What on earth happened there? Smith angled it to short third man, and Finch hared off for one. Smith was always hesitant, and soon enough Finch was at Smith's end. Tried to race back, but the ball was lobbed to Shami, who comfortably removes the bails"
258,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs pierces the covers to get himself a boundary. Half-volley was there on offer, and Smith is too good to let it go, even in the moments after a catastrophic run-out"
259,"Saini to Labuschagne, no run full and straight to Labuschagne at 144 kph. The batsman blocks"
260,"Saini to Labuschagne, 2 runs on the pads again, worked away through midwicket. A bit of sloppiness to let it go through and it allows Australia to come back for two"
261,"Saini to Labuschagne, no run decent shout. Smacks him on the pads, just above the knee roll. Kohli's excited, he reviews. It's Umpire's call on impact. Just shaving the top of the stumps. Labuschagne survives"

265,"Kuldeep to Smith, no run length, around off, and he defends towards mid-wicket"
266,"Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs tossed up around off, and he whips this through mid-wicket. They are scurrying through for two, taking on the man in the deep. And the throw is just not collected by Kuldeep, otherwise Labushchagne could have been in trouble"

275,"Saini to Smith, no run length, slants in, and he defends this towards mid-wicket"
276,"Saini to Smith, FOUR runs length, around leg, and he whips this off his pads down to fine leg. Taken from just in front of the leg stump, and played fine enough. It's a very quick outfield, and this races away"
277,"Kuldeep to Labuschagne, no run tossed up outside off, and he drives hard. On the bounce to Kohli at cover"
278,"Kuldeep to Labuschagne, FOUR runs wrong 'un, and he goes back and punches this between cover and cover-point. Jadeja gives it a game chase, but can't reel it back in. Superb placement and timing!"

449,"Shami to Carey, FOUR runs clever cricket. Clears the front leg, moves away to give himself room and crunches it through the offside. Races away to the boundary"
450,"Shami to Carey, no run shows Shami the stumps again. Backed away, but couldn't quite find a productive shot to go with it"
451,"Shami to Carey, no run slower delivery, smart bowling to close out the over. Depriving Carey of the pace he was looking to use. Well-rescued over in the end"
452,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run wrong 'un, driven away to sweeper cover"
453,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run drops it short, lucky Carey only finds the sweeper with a crunch through the covers"
454,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run cut away, produces only a single"
455,"Kuldeep to Carey, OUT played with the turn, and the wicket finally comes!. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness. But because he was reaching for it outside off stump, he never could get the purchase he needed to clear the ropes. Big wicket for Kuldeep in his final over"
456,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run drives to long-on, and moves to 99."
457,"Kuldeep to Turner, 1 run helped down to third man. Turner keeps the strike"

459,"Bumrah to Turner, no run wonderful bowling. Perfect yorker, and all Turner can do is not let the ball go under his bat"

461,"Bumrah to Turner, no run back of a length, pushed to the covers. No run in this over so far"
462,"Bumrah to Turner, no run five in a row. Almost squared him up. Can Bumrah actually bowl a maiden over here?"
463,"Bumrah to Turner, 1 run runs it down to the deep cover fielder. Turner keeps the strike again. Smith will have to wait a while longer!"
464,"Saini to Turner, 1 run quick single, was desperate to get Smith back on strike. And now, hwre's Smith on 99"
465,"Saini to Smith, no run drives smartly to backward point, who collects sharply. Turner wanted the run, but Smith is taking no chances"
466,"Saini to Smith, 1 run there it is. Runs it down to third man and brings up his ninth ODI hundred, and third against India. It's been a commanding knock. Not much of a celebration. Knows there's more work to be done"
467,"Saini to Turner, 1 run yorker, they scurry through for one. The throw hits Smith as he lunges to get back into the crease"
468,"Saini to Smith, 1 run nice timing, and what's happened now? Smith ran through for a single, and Ashton Turner wasn't even looking at him. A throw at the keeper's end would have produced a wicket"
469,"Saini to Turner, OUT marvellous delivery to finish. Yorker just outside off stump, goes underneath the bat. India re stifling Australia here. And what's this? India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli"

476,"Saini to Smith, FOUR runs and the four finally comes! Yorker that Smith opened the face of the bat to angle past backward point. Excellent shot"
477,"Saini to Smith, SIX runs what an absolutely nonsensical shot that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist."
478,"Saini to Smith, 1 run gets a single to the offside. 13 off the first four. Can Agar support Smith here in making this a gigantic over?"
479,"Saini to Agar, 1 run finally nails the yorker. Agar digs it out and gets Smith back on strike for the final ball of the over"
480,"Saini to Smith, 2 runs worked away to cow corner, and placed it nicely enough he was able to come back for 2. 16 off the over. Australia need at least a couple more like that"
481,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye smacks Agar on the pad, and he runs through for the leg-bye. Right, Smith and Bumrah. What a contest"
482,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs Smith wins the ball for now. Saw third man was inside the circle, and deliberately edges the ball fine of him to get the boundary. This is world-class batting against tough bowling"
483,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs two in a row. Bumrah finally copping some punishment at Smiths hands. Another slower delivery well outside off stump. Poor delivery in truth, and Smith is too hot right now to miss out on that"
484,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run opens the face and runs it down to the sweeper. 10 off four balls"
485,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye gets away with that. Dragged down leg, and Agar can only get his pad to it and come through for another leg bye"
486,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run placed it around cow corner. Realised too late he could have had two. Settles for the one. Still, a dozen off that over"
487,"Shami to Smith, OUT Smith holes out to deep midwicket! Tried to play a similar shot to that flick that went for six a couple of overs ago and Iyer completes a brilliant catch charging in and diving forward. Big wicket, that, could lop about 20-25 runs off the score, potentially."
488,"Shami to Agar, 2 runs guided through the on-side field, and comes back for two. He needs to play a big part here"
489,"Shami to Agar, 1 run inswinging yorker, that's the ball he needs to bowl as much of as possible. Agar can do little but run it off the face and take the single"
490,"Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball."
491,"Shami to Zampa, no run Zampa tamely drives it through the covers. Surprised Shami didn't go for the yorker again"
492,"Shami to Zampa, no run driven back. Splendid over. 3 runs and 2 wickets."
493,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now?"

499,"Shami to Agar, 1 run low full toss, helped along to deep midwicket from Agar, but no more than one"
500,"Shami to Zampa, OUT cleans up Zampa! Shami just keeps picking up wickets. Inswinging full ball, Zampa tries to go big, it comes off his pad and smashes into leg stump"

502,"Shami to Agar, 1 run in the blockhole again, and they only get a single"
503,"Shami to Hazlewood, 1 run gets off the mark with a run down to mid-off"
504,"Shami to Agar, 1 run superb from Shami. Finishes with another yorker, and Australia can only manage to get one off the final delivery. Superb final 10 overs from India. Only 63 runs conceded, and India need 287 to win the game, and the series."
505,"In what used to be the Premier League's marquee clash, Liverpool host Manchester United later tonight. They're on course to lift the trophy, but can they break Man City's points record, or match Arsenal's Invincibles? A close assessment of their run-in suggests they will fall just short."
506,"Right, so Debayan will take you through the first 10 overs after the lunch break. Meanwhile, how about a football teaser?"
507,It's KL Rahul who will open alongside Rohit Sharma.
508,"Cummins to Rahul, no run short, just outside off, and he lets it pass. Bowled at a good pace, and he knows better than to fiddle with it"

510,"Cummins to Rahul, no run length, nips back in, and he defends towards point"

515,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run length, straightens in from middle, and he plays it with the inward movement wide of mid-on"
516,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs width, across him, and he lays his bat it again. Well placed, as he gets it to the left of point. Just a stand-and-deliver drive!"
517,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run length, outside off, slants across him, and he leaves"
518,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs short and wide, and he guides this over point. Wayward start from Starc, and Rohit is ensuring he makes the most of scoring opportunities. Seems to have hit the boundary skirting on the full!"
519,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run length, around off, and he drives towards cover"
520,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run length, straightens after pitching around leg. He looks to flick, and gets rapped on the pads. Australia have a think about a review, but choose not to go for it, after all"

522,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run length, down the leg side, and he whips this away towards fine leg"

972,"Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT he's gone through him! Full ball, and Kohli shuffles across and tries a swipe towards mid-wicket. Misses out on contact, and the ball just kisses the pads and then smashes into the stumps. Chinnaswamy rises as one to applaud this innings.

974,"Starc to Iyer, FOUR runs ooh, a one-handed six on the off side! This is one memorable shellacking that Iyer is handing out to Starc. It's four, in fact, as that one-handed inside out drive lands just short of the extra cover fence"
