226,"Smith to Umar Gul, 1 run flatter, shorter ball, and he gets back and punches to cover"
227,"Smith to Umar Akmal, 1 run fuller ball drifting into the pads, clipped out to the deep for one"
228,"Smith to Umar Gul, 1 run the wrong un, just short of a length, Gul goes back and punches to cover"
229,"Nannes to Umar Gul, no run short ball, pitches outside leg and dashes across, Gul takes his eyes off it and ducks into it"
230,"Nannes to Umar Gul, no run another short ball, 146ks, Gul sways back as it sails over"
231,"Nannes to Umar Gul, no run 144ks, short outside off, Gul swings and connects with air"
232,"Nannes to Umar Gul, 2 runs ah, close to a catch! Gul clears his leg and throws the bat on the ball, getting a thick outer edge that flies down toward third man where Tait runs in and slides to his knees but the ball just does not carry"
233,"Nannes to Umar Gul, no run another swing and a miss as Gul heaves at a short ball"
234,"Watson to Ajmal, 1 run slogs at one short of a length and gets some bat on ball, scampering down as Watson and midwicket run to field"
235,"Watson to Mohammad Asif, 1 run short of a length again, angling across Asif who pokes and runs it down to third man"
236,"Watson to Ajmal, no run swing and a miss! Watson goes for a short ball into Ajmal who heaves and cannot make contact"
237,"Watson to Ajmal, 1 leg bye makes room and charges out to a short ball, which slams into his helmet and runs wide of backward point, they just get one to that means Asif needs six to tie"
238,"Watson to Mohammad Asif, FOUR runs well he gets four but that is not enough! Asif backs away and flat-bats a short ball over mid-on four four but Australia win a thriller to sweep the Tests, ODIs, and Twenty20 of what has been a pretty one-sided series, congratulations to them"
239,"So Pakistan leave Australia without a single win. Another poor tour Down Under. Hope you've enjoyed our coverage of this series. Thanks for your company. That is all we have for you but remember, tomorrow is a Test match between the two best sides and in a couple days Australia will go back to playing West Indies. There is also the series"
240,"What a game, absolutely riveting. Pakistan did so well to shoot Australia out for 127 but their batting, apart from Kamran, was abysmal against a very determined attack. Tait was quick, very quick, and his three wickets for 13 runs were incredibly crucial to Australia winning. Nannes was Nannes, Johnson came back after a horror first over"
241,Australia won by 2 runs
242,"Player of the match is Shaun Tait, AUS"
