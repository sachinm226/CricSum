228,"Cummins to Pant, OUT straight down Finch's throat at mid on! Cummins floated this wide of the off stump again, and with mid on inside the circle, Pant took the invitation of wanting to clear him. Toe-ends this, and Finch takes a smart, low catch to his left. This could cost India an odd 15-20 runs right here"
229,"Cummins to Shankar, 1 run short, outside off, and he runs it down towards third man"
230,"Cummins to Jadhav, 2 runs fuller, on off stump, and he nudges it with soft hands towards midwicket. They want two, and make it look ridiculously easy. Good running!"
231,"Cummins to Jadhav, no run length ball, cuts back into him, and Jadhav blocks this after taking a half-step towards the ball"
232,"Jhye Richardson to Shankar, SIX runs short ball, and he moves away from the crease to create some room, and whacks this straight down the ground. Just clears the long off fence"

236,"Jhye Richardson to Shankar, 1 run short again, and he pushes this away handsomely towards long leg"
237,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, OUT short ball, and he looks to dink this over Carey with a delicate dab, but Carey goes across to his right to take this with his right hand! Today has seen an excellent exhibition of 'keeping from Carey, with this the third smart catch he has picked up"

240,"Cummins to Shankar, 1 wide length ball, down the leg side, and he looks to flick this, but it is called wide"
241,"Cummins to Shankar, OUT short, and he looks to go over midwicket, but cannot clear Glenn Maxwell! Cummins bangs this one into the pitch, and that takes the top edge, and Maxwell holds his shape well at midwicket and takes a steepling catch. Useful little hand has come to an end, that has pushed India over the minimum score India would have wanted to post today"
242,"Cummins to Kuldeep, 1 run short, angles across him, and he pats this towards point"
243,"Cummins to Chahal, OUT FIVE for Cummins! Bangs this in short, and Chahal is squared up as he looks to drive this back. It pops back up, and Cummins takes it, but Dharmasena this time goes up to the third ump, and gives not out as the soft signal. The replays are conclusive though. All clean. Good effort this from Cummins on what is not a helpful pitch by any stretch of imagination"
244,"Cummins to Bumrah, SIX runs length, and he has swung this around, and cleared midwicket! What a shot, and Kohli is jumping up and down with excitement inside the dressing room. Bumrah walks off with a wide grin, and pumps fists with Kuldeep Yadav as he does so. 600 strike rate for the no.11...not too shabby, eh?"
245,"As you would expect from an innings of 358 for 9, there are lots of talking points, all of which are available in Sid Monga's report, which should be up soon. Catch you with the reply soon enough"
246,"5.40pm Welcome back. Not too far from the start of Australia's chase. A target of 359 - something Indian fans still feel terrorised about - after all those years...yes, the 2003 World Cup final, seems possible these days. In fact you'd give teams an even chance to chase it down. Felt impossible at the time. Australia will need one of their top four to score big. Whose turn is it tonight? Sidharth Monga expects this wicket to play true. Throw in dew and Australia will have a"
247,"Bhuvi Kumar with the new ball. Just the one wide slip in the cordon. Finch, who he dismissed on each of the three ODIs in Australia, is on strike"

265,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, FOUR runs delightful drive. Too much width, Marsh forces this into the gap between point and cover."

267,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 1 run runs it down to third man"
268,"Bumrah to Handscomb, FOUR runs toe-ends a push, chopped down to third man where Jadhav was caught napping. Off the mark with a streaky boundary"

441,"Jadhav to Handscomb, SIX runs flat ball, and he comes down the track and hoicks this one straight back. SIX! Quite a remarkable shot, almost like a forehand crosscourt!"
442,"Jadhav to Handscomb, SIX runs wallops another flat one on the stumps, and gets it over long on. Is this the over?"

445,"Jadhav to Handscomb, FOUR runs uses his feet, and drives this through covers. Terrific shot, takes him to 99"
446,"Bumrah to Khawaja, OUT superb catch running in from fine leg! Bumrah peppers him with a short ball from round the stumps, Khawaja hurried onto the pull, clearly late on it and gets a top edge. Kuldeep was late to run in but he certainly wasn't in any dilemma about not going for the catch. It was dying on him when he threw himself forward, managed to cup his hands underneath the ball. Big moment in the game, a monumental stand has been broken, but that said, it may no"
447,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs wrists this wide of mid-on, tremendous use of the bottom hand to whip this from outside off. Wow, dazzling to say the least."

456,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 1 run through with a half-hearted pull, but the ball rolls off the thin edge onto the body and to the off side. Maiden ODI century for Handscomb , terrific knock.

485,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, FOUR runs right into the blockhole, Bhuvi will be anguished to see that squirt to the fine leg boundary off an inside edge. How unlucky. Did most things right with that. Oh, you luck man Handscomb. Would've been plumb had that pinned him on the boot"

504,"Chahal to Turner, 1 wide Pant fluffs one down leg, another one goes begging! This one difted in, he's looking to tuck it fine but is overbalanced and well outside the crease. Oh, dear. Oh dear. Are India missing MS Dhoni behind the stumps or what? Pressure beginning to tell"

509,"Chahal to Turner, 1 wide sees the batsman making room and fires it wide, beaten. India have reviewed a caught behind, but the impression I got is the batsman was through with the shot even before the ball arrived. But they'll look for stumping first, and then for caught behind. Stumping seems fine. They went up for stumping because the square leg umpire went up immediately. India have reviewed for caught behind. Replays confirm a big spike but it was after it passed"

523,"Bumrah to Turner, SIX runs what a shot, what-a-shot. Walks across - the guts, the confidence - and scoops this full delivery and even clears fine leg. ABD would've been proud of that. Fielder inside the ring so the shot was on, had the extra pace, executed it beautifully."

528,"Bhuvneshwar to Turner, 1 run Dhawan drops a dolly at mid-off! Oh, dear. It's all happening. Low full toss, Bhuvi goes full and wide, Turner toe-ends it, it wasn't even travelling fast. Greasy hands, took it too easy. Pressure, pressure, pressure."
529,"Bhuvneshwar to Carey, FOUR runs flicks this low full toss, no one at deep square. This has been a poor over from Bhuvi, lack of match practice showing. He's been off the radar tonight"
530,"Bhuvneshwar to Carey, 1 run tucks this to square leg"
531,"Bumrah to Carey, 4 leg byes off the pad, down leg, races to the fine leg boundary. One blow away from victory now"

535,"Much before Turner's knock, Handscomb use of his feet, particularly off Jadhav and Kuldeep, was particularly impressive. They decided to take the game deep, didn't lose sweat over the escalating asking rate. In the end, will be buoyed with how they won in the end."
536,"Upon reflection, India will realise how poor their senior bowlers were on the night. Bhuvneshwar Kumar's lack of match time showed, Jasprit Bumrah had an off day as he struggled to hit the lengths he has mastered, Rishabh Pant fluffed one straightforward stumping and another tough chance, Jadhav put down one, Dhawan too and all else in between contributed to his epic heist."
537,"9.36pm Who would've thought at 12 for 2 that Australia would pull one off? As well as Khawaja and Handscomb played in their monumental stand, the match-turner is Ashton Turner. A rookie, who was brought in only because of a niggle to Marcus Stoinis, has played the innings of his career yet to give Australia healthy selection headaches."
