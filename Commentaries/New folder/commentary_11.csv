18,"Russell to Finch, no run opens his stance to give himself some room, drives a full delivery to mid-off without much timing. Lost his shape on the stroke"

45,"Walsh to Finch, 1 run starts with a very short one, as he is prone to do, pulled firmly through square leg but can't pick the gap"

49,"Walsh to Marsh, 1 run very short, Marsh has to wait due to the lack of pace, pulled to deep midwicket"
50,"Walsh to Finch, no run fuller at off stump, takes a thick inside half of the bat into the leg side. Australia will probably wonder how that over only went for four runs"

52,"Allen to Finch, 1 run steps back and square drives to deep cover"
53,"Allen to Marsh, OUT big appeal and given! Marsh went a long way across his crease then brought out the sweep, a very full delivery, he certainly looked in front of all three"

73,"Walsh to Finch, OUT skier goes a mile high to deep midwicket and a ricochet off Bravo results in an acrobatic, and very alert, catch by Allen on the rebound! This was a classic leggie's wicket off the bat. Flighted loopy and full on sixth stump to tempt Finch into an almighty slog sweep, but the extra bounce results in a skier swirling over wide long-on. Bravo ranged 25 yards to his right and was in position for the take but may have slightly been distracted by Allen coming across in his eyeline from deep midwicket. Bravo bobbles the chest high chance five yards"
74,"Walsh to Henriques, 1 run good length ball on off, guided in front of point for one."
75,"Allen to Henriques, no run good length ball on off, punched to cover."
76,"Allen to Henriques, 2 runs darted flat on off, goes back and across to flick through square leg, a rushed and wild relay results in a second as the throw goes way wide of Pooran."

84,"Walsh to Turner, no run short and wide, slapped to cover."
85,"Walsh to Turner, no run good length ball on fourth stump, cramped for room trying to cut and cuts to backward point."

90,"Cottrell to Turner, no run short and wide, cuts straight to backward point."
91,"Cottrell to Turner, 2 runs slower ball lands full and wide, Turner shuffles way across his stumps to flick behind square. Gayle runs faster than he has in a decade to track this down from short fine leg and the crowd responds in kind with very loud cheers for the Universe Boss."
92,"Cottrell to Turner, 1 wide full and very wide outside off, too wide, and it means an extra delivery."
93,"Cottrell to Turner, 2 runs full and wide, slices this behind point and Walsh Jr hares right from deep third man to cut this off and relay for two."

95,"Bravo to Henriques, 1 run yorker full pace on middle at 127 kph, driven to Russell at long-on."

97,"Bravo to Henriques, 1 run slower ball lands on a good length on middle at 100 kph, pulled to deep midwicket."
98,"Bravo to Turner, 1 run full outside off at 125 kph, driven firmly to Lewis on as a sub at long-off."

101,"Russell to Turner, 1 run full and wide again, this time pushed through the ring for one."

103,"Russell to Henriques, 2 runs full on fifth stump, sliced behind point and the throw comes to the wrong end to Pooran to allow the second."
104,"Russell to Henriques, 2 runs missed runout! Good length ball on fourth stump punched tamely to extra cover. Throw to the non-striker's stumps would've had Henriques five yards short but it is wide and no backup fielder on the angle allows a second to be taken on the overthrow."

108,"Walsh to Turner, 1 run googly lands on a good length on off and spins in, Turner goes back to punch through cover."
109,"Walsh to Henriques, no run missed stumping! And this was as easy as they come. Henriques charges and flails badly at a stock legbreak pitching on sixth stump, got nowhere near it. Pooran may have gotten too casual if anything with Henriques so far down the track and fumbled it badly."

111,"Walsh to Turner, 2 runs full on the stumps again, heaved in the air into the gap at deep midwicket before Allen circles around to slap it back in for a pair to save a boundary."

118,"Cottrell to Henriques, no run wide yorker on fifth stump this time, plays over the top of it."
119,"Cottrell to Henriques, 3 runs full on fifth stump, drives this to long-on, horrendous misfield by Russell charging past the ball trying to cut off the second and instead it results in a third."
120,"Bravo to Henriques, 1 leg bye leg stump yorker that can't be flicked away, comes off the pads back to Bravo in midwicket for a leg bye."
121,"Bravo to Turner, 1 run full toss at knee height outside leg follows Turner backing away and flicked to deep fine leg."
122,"Bravo to Henriques, OUT shin height full toss on off stump, Henriques tries to heave this over midwicket but it comes too low off the bat nearer the toe and is hitting into the wind as well, doesn't get the distance and Allen comes in off the deep midwicket rope 10 yards to take this catch lunging forward at ankle height. Not nearly as dramatic as the rebound effort off of Bravo's hands earlier in the same spot but still a sharp take nonetheless."
123,"Bravo to Turner, 1 run another low full toss on the body, slapped along the ground to deep midwicket."
124,"Bravo to Christian, 1 run slower ball lands short and well outside leg, backs away and is followed as he pulls this behind square to Walsh Jr on the deep square leg rope who cuts it off for one."
125,"Bravo to Turner, OUT a Champion runout! Yorker on off stump dug out back to Bravo who knifes this out of the air one-handed. Christian was running on anything off the last ball but Turner just watches Bravo start dancing and taunting him to come run to the non-striker's end before Bravo finally ends the suspense by punching the stumps with the ball in his right hand to effect the wicket. Athletic work to intercept the ball in his follow-through before finishing the job at the non-striker's stumps."
126,8.56 pm Another miserly display by the West Indies bowling unit backed up by some tremendous fielding from start to finish. Australia once again finish with what looks like a well-under par total. With Agar missing this will be even more difficult to defend. Henriques now in the post-innings interview also concedes he thinks Australia are 20 short on this wicket. West Indies will be heavy favorites to chase this down. Stick with us through the break when Andrew McGlashan will take back over the central commentary position for the start of the West Indies reply.

134,"Starc to Pooran, 1 run full on middle and leg, flicked through midwicket for one."

137,"Starc to Bravo, 1 run yorker on off stump squirted out to the cover sweeper."
138,"Starc to Pooran, no run low full toss on off checked back down the pitch by Pooran. Starc gets his hand to the ball in his follow-through and deflects it onto the stumps. Bravo was looking for a run and was struggling to get back. Third umpire checking for the runout. Looked obvious live that Starc get fingertips to the ball but the third umpire is being overly cautious checking replays. It doesn't matter regardless as Bravo did wind up getting his bat grounded in the end."
139,"Starc to Pooran, FOUR runs elegant! Full on sixth stump, Pooran opens the face to flash a drive square behind point and beats the man on the ring before skittling to the rope."
140,"Meredith to Pooran, 1 run full on the legs, flicked through midwicket."
141,"Meredith to Russell, (no ball) SIX runs full length ball on fourth stump, Russell clears the front leg to slam this over wide long-on. Overstep too by Meredith so a free hit coming up."

146,"Well that's it from us tonight. Come back on Wednesday for the fourth match in this series when I'll be back on the ball-by-ball duties with Andrew McGlashan. Until then, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care!"
147,"10.33 pm Ex-captain Daren Sammy is pumped up in the stands giving out high-fives galore. Whereas West Indies have shown incredible firepower throughout their order all series, Australia's lineup has been dry of runs with the exception of Mitchell Marsh. Another low score today and their chances were slim defending today. Those chances went from slim to none after Gayle's knock as he passed 14,000 runs in T20 cricket in the process tonight. West Indies are doing all of this without regular captain Kieron Pollard, which underscores their depth and dominance in this serie"
148,West Indies won by 6 wickets (with 31 balls remaining)
149,"Player of the match is Chris Gayle, WI"
