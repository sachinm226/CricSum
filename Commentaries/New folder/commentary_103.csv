1,"Stanlake to Munro, no run fullish, 142kph outside off, driven without timing to point"

4,"Stanlake to Guptill, 1 run angled in straight, 146kph/90mph and dabbed down into the leg side for one"
5,"Stanlake to Munro, SIX runs full, heaved to leg... and into the crowd! Munro clears the pickets for the first time, looked a bit of a mishit as the ball ballooned into the sky, but it had the legs to go all the way. And one of the orangemen in the crowd missed his chance of $50,000, too! Completely misjudged it"

7,"Stanlake to Munro, 1 run pitched up and driven, they take on Warner's arm at mid-off... but the throw is wide"
8,"Kane Richardson to Munro, 1 run length, 134kph and shaping a touch on middle and leg, Munro dabs wide of mid-on"
9,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, no run slightly short of a length in the channel, maybe stays a bit low and Guptill fails to connect"

11,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, no run length delivery outside off, punched square"
12,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, FOUR runs drifting into the pads, Guptill just needs to get a tickle on it, past Carey and away to fine leg"

28,"Stanlake to Guptill, OUT got him, toe-ended to mid-off! Backed away to try and thrash down the ground, completely mistimed and Warner revs the chainsaw in celebration. Stanlake with the breakthrough, Guptill goes (relatively) cheaply this time"
29,"Stanlake to Williamson, 1 wide attempted yorker, 146kph and squirming past the pads, nearly had Williamson off his feet - a touch leg side, though, a called wide"
30,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run comes across and pokes into the covers"

39,"Stoinis to Williamson, no run full, fourth-stump line, driven to cover on the bounce"
40,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run dabbed into the covers, the throw to the non-striker's end flies away, but there's a man backing up eventually"

47,"Agar to Williamson, 2 runs floated up full and Williamson works it into the gap this time, Warner has to run across from long-on and they hustle back for two"
48,"Agar to Williamson, OUT timber! Tossed up by Agar, gets him trying to come down the ground, nowhere near the pitch and an ugly swipe leaves Williamson stranded, the ball thudding into off stump! Nicely bowled, this wasn't a dart - gave it some air and duped the batsman"
49,"Agar to Taylor, 1 run flighted, Taylor comes out and turns it into a full toss, clipped square for one"
50,"Agar to Chapman, OUT tossed up and Chapman attempts to sweep, hit on the front pad - and given! After a moment's discussion, he decides to review, however... Looked pretty good to me, but maybe going on with the angle from round the wicket? No bat involved, it pitched in line and ball-tracking says it would have smashed off stump! Good"
51,"Stanlake to Taylor, 2 runs full and straight and whipped off the toes, Chris Lynn moves across from midwicket and dives to try and cut it off... and he's hurt here, going to need some treatment"

60,"Agar to Taylor, 1 run floated up, worked down the ground"
61,"Agar to de Grandhomme, OUT baits the hook, De Grandhomme bites... picks out cow corner! No great connection and there's a man out there waiting, the safe hands of Glenn Maxwell and Agar has a third wicket! Really not though through, that shot... NZ five down"

65,"Stoinis to Seifert, no run back of a length, 128kph outside off and Seifert cuts firmly but picks out backward point"
66,"Stoinis to Seifert, OUT bowled 'im! Slips in the yorker again, seemed to go under the bat - in fact, Seifert just played the wrong line - and the ball thudded into the base of off stump. Good bowling, Australia applying the chokehold here"

124,"8.35pm: Is that enough for a game? NZ struggled, despite another lively opening. The pitch looked a little more difficult to time the ball on, but David Warner shuffled his attack brilliantly and, after Guptll and Munro fell in succession, NZ just couldn't get going. Ross Taylor battled manfully but you'd back Australia to blast their way to"
125,"Right, the teams are back. Here's Trent Boult, armed with the new ball"
126,"Boult to Warner, no run full and straight, a hint of swing, tight line to the left-hander. A solid start"
