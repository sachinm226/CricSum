55,"Ntini to Hayden, FOUR runs Very small boundaries here and Australia are cashing in. Full in length, on the middle stump line and Hayden shapes to loft it over the bowler's head, again the bat-handle rotates, and the inside-edge takes it to square-leg boundary. Hmm..."
56,"Ntini to Hayden, FOUR runs Whack! Length-delivery on the off stump line has been crashed through the gap between the bowler and mid-off. Almost took out Gilchrist."

77,"Langeveldt to Hayden, 1 run close to the off stump, not much room for Hayden to cut, so ... he opens the face of the blade and runs it down to third man."

79,"Hall to Hayden, FOUR runs strays on to the pads, Hayden leans forward, clips it to fine-leg. Easy pickings."
80,"Hall to Hayden, SIX runs Clubbed away. A flat six over long-off. 100 is up. This man is in some mood. Full-pitched on the off stump line, Hayden takes his front leg out of the line and biffs it flat, fast and over mid-off. It ends up screaming over long-off as well."

He shapes to cut but the ball stops on him and he sends a dolly to Gibbs at backward point. What a frenetic start it has been. It was all on a fast-forward motion. No pause or stop button in sight. Until this happenned."

172,"Pollock to Clarke, no run short in length, outside off stump, cut to point. Not well timed as Clarke went too hard at it."

Clarke is bit too early into his push-drive and it flies to the left of short midwicket where de Villiers hurls himself full length but can't reach it.

199,"Ntini to Clarke, no run short in length, on the middle stump line, Clarke gets behind the line, defends to the on side."
200,"Ntini to Clarke, no run Clarke is getting itchy. He backs away to the leg side, exposing the stumps, and Ntini loves indecent exposure. Homes in on the middle peg and Clarke cuts it to cover"

Another stunning hit on this feather-bed of a pitch. Barry Richards, on air, murmurs about the long batting line-up of South Africa. Hopefully, we shall have a interesting game."
223,"Pollock to Clarke, 1 run"
224,"Pollock to Ponting, SIX runs second six of the over, 4th of Pollock, and this was nonchalantly done. Full in length, around off stump line and Pollock leant forward and chipped it on the up. I thought it would go over mid-off but it just kept sailing. Fab stroke and SA continue to leak runs."

249,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 run"
250,"Kallis to Ponting, FOUR runs low- full toss, well outside off stump but Ponting is in a greedy mood. Takes out the bottom-hand, stretches out and drills it to deep point. This is a small boundary and the sweeper cover can't reach it"

263,"Ntini to Clarke, no run Swing and a miss. Short in length, outside off stump, and Clarke has one almighty swing. No luck."
264,"Ntini to Clarke, 1 run Full and straight, on the off stump line, Clarke flashes it down the ground, to left of Prince at long-off who makes a good stop. It dropped awkwardly in front of him, not close to go for the catch, not far to step back and stop."

Symonds drives a full-pitched delivery to midwicket and stays rooted to the crease. Clarke runs down to the middle of the pitch and turns back. Too late. But what a fabulous knock it has been. Entertaining."
273,"Langeveldt to Symonds, 1 run on the off stump line, dabbed down to third man"
274,"Langeveldt to Hussey, 1 run well outside the off stump, driven to deep cover"

294,"Langeveldt to Symonds, FOUR runs That's a blitzer of a flat-batted shot. Symonds simpy gives himself room and launches a most brutal slap through extra-cover for a one-bounce six. When he hits them .. you know the rest"
295,"Langeveldt to Symonds, 1 run driven to long-off for a single this time, the force is there but not the timing"
296,"Langeveldt to Watson, FOUR runs This time he comes off. Shuffles across the stumps and sweeps to the vacant fine leg region for a four. Classy stuff from Watson, that was treated as if a spinner was bowling. Easy and cool"
297,"Langeveldt to Watson, 2 runs Full ball on off and Watson creams it over extra cover, not that well timed as the ball drops in front of Ashwell Prince who is running around. Batsmen settle for two"
298,"Langeveldt to Watson, FOUR runs Swept again, this time in front of square for another four. It's too easy - move across and swat. Watson troubling with his cheek. Langeveldt can only watch and despair after his 10 over spell that bled 82"

305,And so here we are with the third highest total in World Cups. We've had the fastest hundred in World Cup history and a couple of 90s that have set Warner Park alight. Fours and sixes have bucketed down with the batsmen taking heavy toll on the short straight boundaries. Shaun Pollock turned in his worst performance in an ODI and South Africa had a forgettable day on the field. We know what happened the last time the two teams met - Australia amassed
