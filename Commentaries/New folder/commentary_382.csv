62,"Bravo to Warner, no run fuller length and Warner drives from his crease to mid-off"

Sunil Narine thrived on the surface, restricting the run flow with Marlon Samuels and Kemar Roach. Dwayne Bravo picked up three wickets. West Indies have not beaten Australia in an ODI since the group stages of the 2006 Champions Trophy. They have a good chance"

401,"So that just about wraps things up for today. The second match is on Sunday and we'll see if West Indies can bounce back. But don't forget the third day of New Zealand-South Africa starts shortly and we'll have full coverage on ESPNcricinfo. For now, though, it's goodbye from Andrew McGlashan and George Binoy."
402,"I'll bring you the presentation shortly, and Brydon's match report will be here."
403,"Australia, though, will be delighted with the winning start on a tricky surface. The batting wasn't and its best but they mustered a decent total. Early wickets then gave them a lift then Doherty responded superbly from a tough first over that cost 18."
404,So Australia win by a comfortable 64 runs after a pretty miserable batting performance from West Indies who gifted most of their wickets. Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo had laid a platform but it disintegrated in the blink of an eye. It raises familiar questions about West Indies' batting stocks and there is plenty of work to do ahead of the second match on Sunday.
405,Australia won by 64 runs
406,"Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS"
