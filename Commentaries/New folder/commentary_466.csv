0,"26.3;4;Kallis to Clarke, FOUR runs the outswinger is over-cooked, Kallis sends down an amiable full toss outside off and Clarke shows exemplary footwork and wrists as he eases it into the covers.;"
1,"Tahir to Clarke, no run whippy ball straightens and slides down straight on middle and off, Clarke forces the cut into the off side."
2,"Tahir to Clarke, 1 run more width this time, he cuts it away square for a single."
3,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up outside off, Marsh leans out and defends into the off side."
4,"Tahir to Marsh, no run nice variation in length, Marsh was trying to get forward and then realised he wasn't going to get there. Adjusts and defends to the off side."
5,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run fuller now, he leans well forward and drives to mid-off for a single."
6,"Tahir to Clarke, no run Clarke leans out to the ball flighted outside off and defends to the off side."
7,"Philander to Marsh, no run angles the first ball across Marsh from over the stumps, and he leaves it to the keeper."
8,"Philander to Marsh, no run appeal for an lbw, it is turned down and South Africa review again. That was sent down from over the stumps, and it hit his front pad - a foot in front of the crease - in front of leg and middle, as Marsh tries to flick it away. But the operative part"
9,"Philander to Marsh, no run wasted ball down the leg side, Marsh can't get the glance away, it is too wide."
10,"Philander to Marsh, no run deviates sharply away from the left hander after landing full outside off, Marsh doesn't bother with it."
11,"Philander to Marsh, no run angled across once again, Marsh watches the seam movement closely and leaves."
12,"Philander to Marsh, 2 runs back of a length at 133 kph, Marsh tucks it around the corner for a couple more. South Africa's attack seem to be losing steam now."
13,"Tahir to Clarke, no run tossed up outside off, driven with the turn into the off side."
14,"Tahir to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke's gone to 50, and I swear I had no idea he had got that many. This is a really good innings, consdering he was being owned by Steyn at the start of it. Tahir sends down a gentle full toss on the pads as Pup advances, and whips it away through m"
15,"Tahir to Clarke, no run another full toss, driven strongly into the covers where a diving save from AB comes in the way. He's already nursing a sore finger, and that troubled it some more."
16,"Tahir to Clarke, 1 run another fullish ball outside off, Clarke gets the single into the covers."
17,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up and straightening into Marsh from outside off and he defends."
18,"Tahir to Marsh, no run that held its line as it went across Marsh, who defended to the off side."
19,"Philander to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off, Clarke lets it go as he stays on the crease."
20,"Philander to Clarke, no run a ripper amidst a lot of ordinary bowling. Vernon goes closer to an acceptable length for a change, Clarke tries to get forward but is yards short of it as it lands and zips away off the seam, play and a miss of epic proportions."
21,"Philander to Clarke, no run covers the line better this time and defends down the line."
22,"Philander to Clarke, 1 run angled into the pads, Clarke is inside the line and helps it along to fine leg for a single."

24,"Philander to Marsh, no run 129 kph and a fuller length outside off, Marsh defends compactly into the off side."
25,"Tahir to Clarke, 2 runs Is Clarke the best player of spin in this side? Almost inevitably, he shimmies out of the crease, gets to the pitch and laces Tahir into the covers for a couple."
26,"Tahir to Clarke, FOUR runs inexperience showing. Tahir sends down an amiable full toss, Clarke says thank you and butchers it with a slog-heave over midwicket. He'll be sad he didn't get six for it."
27,"Tahir to Clarke, 1 run skips out again, punches down to mid-on for a single."
28,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run tossed up to Marsh, he drives smoothly past wide mid-on for another single."
29,"Tahir to Clarke, 1 run tossed up wide of off stump, Clarke leans out with an opened face and guides it square for a single."
30,"Tahir to Marsh, no run another full toss, outside off stump, and Marsh swings it to Smith at mid-on."
31,"Philander to Clarke, no run that's the length he needs to maintain. Full, outside off, drawing Clarke forward into a check-drive into the covers."
32,"Philander to Clarke, no run this one wobbles away from a length outside off, Clarke shoulders arms now."
33,"Philander to Clarke, no run beaten by an indipper. Vernon's biggest strength is the ability to get the wobble going either way, that one cut in sharply from a length and stayed low too. Clarke was back on the crease and loose in defence, the ball cut through him and just missed"
34,"Philander to Clarke, (no ball) 1 run over-steps and drifts onto the pads now, Clarke helps it away to the leg side for one."
35,"Philander to Marsh, no run now he bends one into the left-hander cutting him into two, almost. Clarke manages to keep it out though, as he's caught on the crease."
36,"Philander to Marsh, FOUR runs what a peach of a pick-up whip through midwicket. Half-volley on the pads alright, but Marsh's movement was a treat to watch there as he got the front foot into line and dispatched it with a decisive jab of the wrists."
37,"Philander to Marsh, no run back of a length outside off, Marsh stays back and defends backward of point."
38,"Tahir to Clarke, 1 run over-pitched on the stumps, Clarke drives it back past Tahir who fumbles to allow the single."
39,"Tahir to Marsh, no run flighted on the pads, worked softly to the leg side."
40,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up outside off now, Marsh plays it back to the bowler."
41,"Tahir to Marsh, FOUR runs flighted too far outside off, Tahir is looking completely harmless here. Marsh shows him the way to the extra cover boundary with a lovely reach across and a gentle swish of the bat."
42,"Tahir to Marsh, FOUR runs even more decisively this time. Marsh gets more width outside off, and leans out and whacks it away into the covers. This spell must be coming to an end."
43,"Tahir to Marsh, no run googly tossed up outside off, driven off the front foot back to the bowler."
44,"Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs Australia are slowly taking control here. Vernon nips one back into Clarke from too short of a length, and Pup hops to nudge it away behind square for four more."
45,"Philander to Clarke, no run back of a length and a much better line, Clarke gets behind it and plays it back to the bowler."
46,"Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs over-pitched now at an amiable 131 kph on the pads. Food, drink, dessert and some other assorted goodies for someone with Clarke's wrosts as he stays on the crease and swooshes it away through midwicket."
47,"Philander to Clarke, no run finally finds the channel outside off, and Clarke shoulders arms duly."
48,"Philander to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off, Clarke doesn't have a go at it as it bustles away harmlessly to the keeper."
49,"Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs Vernon seams this away, but it is far too short outside off to trouble Clarke. He stays back, reads it off the track, stays on top of the bounce and guides it expertly through point for another four. SA are haemorhaging now as the stand is worth o"
50,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up outside off, Marsh ensures it doesn't break in and defends off the front foot."
51,"Tahir to Marsh, no run he's forward again and blocks off the front foot."
52,"Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up on off stump, defended off the front foot."

54,"Tahir to Marsh, no run a touch of drift away from Marsh, very full ball and he digs it back to the leg side."
55,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run Marsh chips out now, gets close to the flight and whips a single to midwicket."
56,"Steyn to Marsh, OUT It's taken him one ball to make a difference! Marsh's been ruled lbw, and he's being very optimistic reviewing that. Good old patent indipper, lands at pace on a length around off stump and nips in, Marsh has been solid all day, but this time he doesn't get"
57,"Steyn to Hussey, no run Aha! 143 kph, hits the gloves with a bombshell that darts back in from short of a length. Hussey tries to fend it away the way the late Frasier would have tried to keep Ali's jabs away. The bottom hand is off, the top hand takes a rap and the ball goes t"
58,"Steyn to Hussey, no run better from the Huss, gets behind the line this time."
59,"Steyn to Hussey, no run that's gone away, that's absolutely exploded from a short length, Hussey ducks for dear life, and Bouch's gloves take a pounding."
60,"Steyn to Hussey, no run 145 kph, on the hips, Hussey shuffles into the line and deflects it to the leg side."
61,"Steyn to Hussey, no run length ball on middle and leg at 144 kph, what a sensational over. Hussey nudges it to the leg side. A huge breach before tea, but Hussey has done well to ensure one wicket didn't lead to another."
62,"Morkel to Clarke, no run short and wide at 140 kph, it has been a bit of a malaise today, this length. Easy leave outside off."
63,"Morkel to Clarke, no run again, short and miles wide of off stump, Clarke lets it go through to the keeper."
64,"Morkel to Clarke, 4 byes aha, Morne again sends this wide of off stump, it then seams away and dies on Bouch who is miffed as it runs away for byes."
65,"Morkel to Clarke, 1 run too short, too wide at 142 kph, and Clarke cuts it away square for a single."
66,"Morkel to Hussey, 1 run short of a length, easy line on the pads at 142 kph and Hussey turns it round the corner for a single."
67,"Morkel to Clarke, 1 run too short, too wide, Clarke leans across and hacks it square for another single."
68,"Steyn to Clarke, 2 runs starts with a full ball outside off that goes away, Clarke starts with a positive push forward and across, and a chirpy drive into the covers."
69,"Steyn to Clarke, 1 run full and wide outside off, Clarke takes him on with an uppish square drive. A dodgy shot for just a single, since deep point is in place."
70,"Steyn to Hussey, no run too full, too wide, Hussey can't reach it if he wants to."
71,"Steyn to Hussey, no run short of a length outside off, Hussey sees it through to the keeper."
72,"Steyn to Hussey, no run fuller length on and outside off stump, pushed into the covers off the front foot."
73,"Steyn to Hussey, no run on the pads to end the over, Hussey turns it away with the wrists to square leg. Not the most fiery Steyn over we have seen today."
74,"Morkel to Clarke, 1 run too short and too wide, Clarke reaches across and cuts to the deep for a single."
75,"Morkel to Hussey, no run angled in from wide of the crease, Hussey stays back and nudges off the pads to square leg."
76,"Morkel to Hussey, no run big bounce outside off, Hussey watches the rise and stands tall and shoulders arms to keep the bat out of the way."
77,"Morkel to Hussey, no run pegs him back with another short ball, Hussey covers the line and defends."
78,"Morkel to Hussey, no run a Morne special that. Comes in from wide of the stumps, lands outside off and straightens subtly enough to beat Hussey as he defends down the straight line. It misses the edge too, and hits the thigh. Jaffa."
79,"Morkel to Hussey, no run ends the over with a steep bouncer, Hussey tries to get under it and clout the pull away, but it is through him in a big hurry."
80,"Steyn to Clarke, FOUR runs boy, Clarke is seeing the ball like a boulder rolling down the Table Mountain. Short and wide from Steyn at 144 kph, Clarke absolutely climbs on it and pulverises the ball with a cut shot that sends the ball speeding away on the double."
81,"Steyn to Clarke, no run fuller now, Clarke's not close to it, but still drives competently, but straight to mid-off."
82,"Steyn to Clarke, no run full length on 137 kph, driven off the front foot to mid-off."
83,"Steyn to Clarke, no run back of a length outside off at 140 kph, Clarke stays back and rises on the toes to let it go."
84,"Steyn to Clarke, no run short ball once more, steep climb outside off and Clarke keeps the bat well below the firing line."
85,"Steyn to Clarke, no run finishes with the full ball, Clarke takes the bait but doesn't fall for it. He leans out and drives into the covers."
86,"Morkel to Hussey, no run back of a length from round the stumps, defended to the off side from the crease."
87,"Morkel to Hussey, no run huge indipper, Morne gets this going from well wide of off stump, and Hussey ends up having to really tuck his tummy in and stay back as it keeps coming in."
88,"Morkel to Hussey, OUT and another, Hussey is gone off the inside edge. Morne's getting the ball to whistle in sharply now, and it is too good for Mr Cricket. He let the previous one go, but knew it came disconcertingly close to off stump. This time he tries to stay put on the c"
89,"Morkel to Haddin, no run short and pacy outside off, climbing away steeply outside off, Haddin lets it go."
90,"Morkel to Haddin, FOUR runs what a hoick to get going. Short and wide outside off, Haddin smashes it away with cartoonish impetuosity. He stands tall, lifts one foot in the air and launches this towards third man."
91,"Morkel to Haddin, 1 run gets a single to end the over, which means he faces Steyn now."
92,"Steyn to Haddin, no run 144 kph, short of a length, buzzing away from wide of off stump. Haddin stays rooted at the crease and swishes wildly at it, but it is through him."
93,"Steyn to Haddin, no run Haddin is absolutely #pwned by this one, and he knows he just wasn't good enough to nick it. Pacy, on the perfect length around middle and off and then zipping away like an inebriated college student. Haddin wasn't forward, and tried driving down the lin"
94,"Steyn to Haddin, no run tries the dream ball that zips away from leg stump, but sprays it down the leg side."
95,"Steyn to Haddin, no run he's caught on the crease again, gets across but not forward as he tries to cover the line. Too good, this, from Steyn."
96,"Steyn to Haddin, OUT ah well, Aus are in big trouble now. Haddin's gone, not learning the lesson from the previous two balls. Stays on the crease again as Steyn gets fuller and closer to off stump to ensure Haddin doesn't play and miss this time. Haddin obliges, gets across and"
97,"Steyn to Johnson, no run full and fast angled across Mitch, who gets across but shoulders arms."
98,"Morkel to Clarke, 1 run Morne attacks the stumps from over the stumps, Clarke works it square for a single."
99,"Morkel to Johnson, no run covers the line as Morne keeps it on a length, and defends with full face to the off side."
100,"Morkel to Johnson, no run short of a length outside off, defended from the crease."
101,"Morkel to Johnson, 2 runs bouncer, Mitch wants to pull but it climbs extra on him and he's aeons late on the shot and heaves it ungainly in front of square."
102,"Morkel to Johnson, no run that's page 1 from 'How not to play the bouncer for dummies'. Mitch stays rooted, doesn't duck, takes his eyes off the ball, holds the bat in front of his face and fends in hope. He manages to keep it down somehow."
103,"Morkel to Johnson, FOUR runs well done Mitch, he knew this was going to be full. He stayed on the crease, but was crouching low to pounce on the half-volley and flick it furiously through midwicket."
104,"Steyn to Clarke, 2 runs full ball on off stump and swerving away, Clarke drives into the covers. Not well timed, but that's positive footwork for you."
105,"Steyn to Clarke, no run goes to leg stump and looks to square him up, it straightens down the line and Clarke works it cautiously to the leg side."
106,"Steyn to Clarke, 2 runs full and wide of off stump, Clarke drives away from the body, but it doesn't seem to matter anymore, since he's middling almost everything. Amla trots across from deep point to cut off the boundary."
107,"Steyn to Clarke, 1 run short ball, misdirected onto the hips and Clarke glances it in pleasing fashion down to fine leg."
108,"Steyn to Johnson, 1 leg bye back of a length, nudged off the hips down to fine leg."
109,"Steyn to Clarke, 2 runs looks to york him, finishes a half volley at 134 kph on the toes and Clarke twinkles it away through midwicket for a couple."
110,"Morkel to Johnson, no run buzzes in back of a length from over the stumps, it takes off from there the way it does when Morne bowls, and Mitch stays out of the way."
111,"Morkel to Johnson, no run stays on the crease this time and plays with the angle to the leg side."
112,"Morkel to Johnson, 2 runs smashes the pull away, absolute swat that as a 142 kph bumper came along. Somehow, it wasn't timed as well as it seemed he would have with such a sumptuous swing. Still worth a couple."
113,"Morkel to Johnson, no run Morne goes wider of off stump, Mitch leans out and shoulders arms."
114,"Morkel to Johnson, FOUR runs Mitch is looking super dangerous here from SA""s point of view. Full ball, wide of off stump, inviting the poke or the push, but what does Mitch give it? The kitchen sink. He doesn't try getting close to the line, he just lashes at it and the ball ta"
115,"Morkel to Johnson, 2 runs length delivery on middle and leg, Mitch flicks with hard hands, a touch uppish, but he finds the gap and gets a couple through midwicket."
116,"Kallis to Clarke, no run length ball seaming away as is Kallis' wont, Clarke lets it go."
117,"Kallis to Clarke, no run goes wider of off stump now, Clarke isn't sucked into playing at it."
118,"Kallis to Clarke, no run 126 kph, nips this one in off a length, and there's a huge lbw appeal as Clarke is hit on the pad Umpire Gould has been phenomenal so far today, and SA decide against reviewing his decision. Correct call too, Clarke was struck quite high as he moved int"
119,"Kallis to Clarke, FOUR runs a thing of beauty this, Clarke's flowing cover drive. Kallis goes back to the full away-swinger, Clarke leans out, gets close to the pitch and the hands then take over, just rolling through the line."
120,"Kallis to Clarke, no run shorter length, wide of off stump and this time Clarke lets it go through."
121,"Kallis to Clarke, no run finishes with a length ball on off stump, and it is punched confidently to wide mid-off."
122,"Philander to Johnson, no run a bit of a loosener, angled across at a gentle pace, and Mitch defends from the crease."
123,"Philander to Johnson, 2 runs don't pitch on the pads of Mitch. Else he'll swish it with a flick of the wrists. Just like that."
124,"Philander to Johnson, no run short ball, Mitch spots the length early and ducks under it."
125,"Philander to Johnson, 1 run shaped in off the seam and it ends on Mitch's pads again, this time he turns it more politely and finds square leg."
126,"Philander to Clarke, no run appeal for lbw as Vernon jags one back into Clarke. Second time in recent times Clarke's been caught napping by an indipper, but height's saved him again. He was playing for the straight ball, but it kept coming in and hit him above the pad. Quite ad"
127,"Philander to Clarke, 1 run fuller length to end the over, Clarke drills it into the covers for a single."
128,"Kallis to Clarke, 1 run short ball, Clarke gets inside the line and pulls it away square for a single. Takes him to 98."
129,"Kallis to Johnson, no run heavy ball, landed well short and Mitch looks for the upper cut. Play and a miss."
130,"Kallis to Johnson, 3 runs nice shot. Kallis pitches up at a friendly pace, and Mitch drills it into the covers for three."
131,"Kallis to Clarke, no run short and wide of off stump, Clarke lets it go to the keeper."
132,"Kallis to Clarke, FOUR runs what a corker of a shot to bring up a corker of a 100. Kallis tries to tempt him into edging a drive with a full ball outside off. The drive came, the edge didn't. Clarke veritably walks into the cover drive and almost inevitably finds the gap. He pu"
133,"Kallis to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off, Clarke lets it go through."
134,"Philander to Johnson, no run short of a length on Mitch's middle and leg line, he looks for the whip again but can't get it away."
135,"Philander to Johnson, no run"
136,"Philander to Johnson, OUT one shot too many, and that's the end of Mitch. South Africa will breathe a sigh of relief to see their tormentor back, but this may prove to be an invaluable 20. Short ball, angled across wide of off stump, and he tries to forehand it across to the le"
137,"Philander to Harris, 1 run Harris is away, stays back and drops a length ball into the point area and scurries to the other end."
138,"Philander to Clarke, no run goes away off the seam from outside off, Clarke opens up his stance and defends to the off side."
139,"Philander to Clarke, (no ball) fuller length, driven hard by Clarke but he can't beat mid-off. AB de Villiers puts in a big stretch and dives, and seems to have strained his back in the process. He has had back issues in the past ..."
140,"Philander to Clarke, 1 wide too short, and called a wide for height now. This over is taking longer than expected."
141,"Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs uppish, but safe as houses. Clarke is into position for the drive so early, he slots it in the air to the leg side of the pitch, and Philander has no chance to grab it on his follow through. Clarke is looking invincible now."
142,"Kallis to Harris, no run Kallis plugs away back of a length outside off, Harris doesn't take the bait this time."
143,"Kallis to Harris, 2 runs a good old tail-ender's smear from Harris. Opens up the off side, flexes his muscles and just lofts it over the covers for a couple."

145,"Kallis to Harris, 2 runs another stand and deliver pick up over the covers from Harris, he ensures the ball hits the middle of the bat and clears the in-field."
146,"Kallis to Harris, no run fuller and attacking the stumps, Harris stays in the crease and covers the line to defend down the track."
147,"Kallis to Harris, no run Harris defends the last ball before drinks, gets behind the line and blocks to the off side."
148,"Philander to Clarke, no run short of a length on off stump, Clarke covers the line and defends solidly."
149,"Philander to Clarke, 1 run opens the face of the bat as he stays on the crease and guides square. Gee, Vernon seems to have lost a few yards since the morning."
150,"Philander to Harris, no run on Harris' pads at 131 kph, he skips inside the line and works it to square leg."
151,"Philander to Harris, no run bouncer, Harris ducks early and gets out of danger."
152,"Philander to Harris, OUT a typical tail-ender job from Harris, he's holed out to mid-on in comical fashion. Bouncer outside off, its heading for his face and he tries it swat it away as if it were a bothersome fly. He gets a top-edge and it goes high, and doesn't come very low"
153,"Philander to Siddle, no run full ball outside off, Siddle leans forward and defends square."

159,"Steyn to Siddle, FOUR runs too full and a bit too straight, Siddle stays in his crease and clips it wide of the fielder at midwicket"
160,"Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs I cannot believe there is no second slip. Clarke pushes from his crease at a good length ball that seams away from him and edges it towards the cordon. Smith dives to his right from first slip but can't reach it properly. that could have gone stra"
