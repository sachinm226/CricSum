597,"""I'm very proud of the time I've had here. The crowd were fantastic, just a shame they've got to leave with a loss. Hopefully this will sharpen us up, it was a reminder."""
598,"""It's always painful when you lose, especially when you seemingly have the game in the bag like we did. Sri Lanka bowled well and took the chances when they came."""
