0,"10.00am Strauss calls heads, England have won the toss and will bowl first. What's more, it's confirmed that Tim Bresnan comes in for Steven Finn. Australia field an unchanged team, Punter says he wasn't sure what he was going to do first thing this morning - his instinct told him bat, but with the grass and moisture in the wicket the bowlers are likely to control proceed"
1,"Anderson to Watson, no run touch of swing first up, but no great pace by the looks of things, Watson lets it go by outside off stump"
2,"Anderson to Watson, no run more action here, Anderson goes full in search of swing, finds some and Watson flashes a drive, connecting firmly but only to find Bell who fields smartly at point. The fielder earns plenty of pats and cheers for his efforts, betrays the nerves out there"
3,"Anderson to Watson, no run again some swing, nothing dramatic and Watson lines it up early enough to leave comfortably"
4,"Anderson to Watson, no run touch too short from the bowler, allows Watson to survey the bounce outside off stump"
5,"Anderson to Watson, no run edged and it looks like it's carried to Collingwood at third slip, dropped, dramatic start, perfect delivery, full and swinging away late, found a thickish edge that flew low to Collingwood's left but he couldn't hold on"
6,"Anderson to Watson, no run ooh, closer to off stump and left alone. Ends an eventful first over, Strauss will be relieved to have seen the swing first up"
7,"Tremlett to Hughes, no run Tremlett starts well, finding the right length, the line is slightly too wide though and Hughes gets a sighter first up"
8,"Tremlett to Hughes, FOUR runs shot! Good stuff from Hughes, I think this is how he has to play, gets a fraction of width and smashes past point for four"
9,"Tremlett to Hughes, 2 runs more runs, Tremlett goes fuller, in search of some swing, Hughes eases it wide of mid-on for a couple"
10,"Tremlett to Hughes, FOUR runs four more! What a start this is. Tremlett floats up a fuller ball and Hughes climbs all over it, thrashing through the covers for another boundary"
11,"Tremlett to Hughes, no run good comeback from Tremlett, touch of extra bounce and tucks Hughes up in defence"
12,"Tremlett to Hughes, no run left alone outside off, the ball barely reaches Prior who has to collect low down, ends a lively first over for Hughes"
13,"Anderson to Watson, 2 runs dropped! Watson gets another life, Pietersen this time has put down a straightforward chance, it was short and wide, Watson flashed a cut that flew quickly at around head height to Pietersen who got two hands to it, but it burst through"
14,"Anderson to Watson, no run beaten this time outside off stump, touch of away swing past the outside edge"
15,"Anderson to Watson, no run this time Watson lands a very solid defence, clunking forward on the front foot"
16,"Anderson to Watson, 3 runs full and swinging, (like a Christmas party?), Watson drives firmly, without quite timing it well enough to get four"
17,"Anderson to Hughes, no run ooh, edgy defence from Hughes, gets tucked up again with a shortish ball and fends off towards short leg"
18,"Anderson to Hughes, no run touch of inswing to the left-hander, Hughes plays around his front pad and can't quite connect"
19,"Tremlett to Watson, no run touch of extra pace here, forces Watson back and beats the attempted work-to-leg, crashes into the thigh"
20,"Tremlett to Watson, OUT third time lucky for England, Tremlett strikes with a cracker of a delivery, climbed from a length and rapped the glove, it looped gently to gully, simple enough chance for England to finally hold one"
21,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run gets an early sighter, just what he wants a few of, outside off stump, touch of extra bounce, Ponting leaves alone expansively"
22,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run oh great take from Prior flying to his left down the leg side, Tremlett fired it in short, Ponting had a flap at it but didn't connect"
23,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run that's just about the perfect delivery for Tremlett, finding extra bounce from a fullish length, Ponting defends well but whips his bottom hand off the bat as he does so"
24,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run this is close to off stump but Ponting's judgement is sound enough to let it go by. Good over, wicket maiden"
25,"Anderson to Hughes, no run definite swing here, the clouds have come over the ground, which will make Jimmy smile, this swings down the leg side though and Prior collects"
26,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Hughes tucks this to short leg to defend"
27,"Anderson to Hughes, no run ideal delivery from Anderson, full, swinging in late and Hughes gets in a tangle as he defends, luckily for him an inside edge prevented drama"
28,"Anderson to Hughes, no run nicely played here, Hughes drops this into the covers off the back foot, looks for a single but the fielders rush in in a hurry"
29,"Anderson to Hughes, 1 run neatly tucked around the corner for a single to get off strike and begin another round of the Anderson v Ponting battle"
30,"Anderson to Ponting, no run Ponting gets firmly behind a defiant defensive block to cover"
31,"Tremlett to Hughes, no run ah, another snorter here and Tremlett follows through a long way to smile at Hughes, this leapt off a length and climbed past the outside edge"
32,"Tremlett to Hughes, no run bouncer, very short indeed and Hughes could have stood still to leave, as it was he ducked"
33,"Tremlett to Hughes, 1 run worked away around the corner for a single to fine leg"
34,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run good delivery here, on and around off stump on a length, Ponting defends busily and marches down the wicket for some gardening"
35,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run good length and line from Tremlett but Ponting is secure in defence, turning this to short leg who fields and shapes to throw all in one movement"
36,"Tremlett to Ponting, 1 run ooh, mix up between the batsman and if Cook's throw had hit from backwards short leg Hughes would have gone! Ponting nudged it just wide of Cook who scampered after it and the batsmen eventually decided on a single that was never there, fortunately for them, Cook missed"
37,"Anderson to Ponting, no run inswinger from Anderson, just showing Ponting he has one, comes in a long way from outside off but quite early and Ponting can line up a defence"
38,"Anderson to Ponting, no run this is an outswinger and Ponting has nothing to do with it"
39,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run angled into Ponting this time and he works a much more secure single into the midwicket region"
40,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Anderson has been luckless this morning, this is a beauty that nips away off the seam, past a dangling outside edge on its way to Prior"
41,"Anderson to Hughes, no run very smartly taken from Prior down the leg side here, Anderson got his line wrong and it just flicked Hughes's thigh, made it very difficult for Prior collecting on the half-volley but he did so with ease"
42,"Anderson to Hughes, no run solid, defiant defence from Hughes to end the over, really willing himself forward and into line"
43,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run big appeal from Tremlett, less from behind the stumps as Ponting is struck flush on the pads outside off stump. Umpire Dar wasn't interested"
44,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run good length finds a touch of extra bounce and Ponting jabs to short leg, playing on the hop a touch"
45,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run ah lovely length and line, Ponting doesn't want to get forward to a 10ft bowler, who would? But get forward he does, just about and late and it finds the outer half of the bat in defence"
46,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run Tremlett is really steaming in here, but when the line is like this - fired down the leg side - it's pointless"
47,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run good solid defence from Ponting, gets all of this and it trickles towards cover"
48,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run movement back into the batsman raps Ponting on the thigh as he leaves alone, ends an excellent over"
49,"Anderson to Hughes, no run plenty of nip and nibble about, this swings late into Hughes who gets into an awkward position in defence"
50,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Hughes looked like he wanted to leave this but saw some late swing and poked at it uneasily"
51,"Anderson to Hughes, 1 run nicely done from Hughes, good intent here, looking for an attacking offside stroke, the late swing meant he couldn't free his arms but still picked up a single towards cover"
52,"Anderson to Ponting, no run snorter, absolute beauty from Anderson here, pitch on a length and went like a legbreak past the outside edge"
53,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 leg bye this time Anderson jumps wider of the crease and angles it in before swinging it away, the bowler was probably looking for too much though and it thuds off the pads for a single"
54,"Anderson to Hughes, no run worked firmly off the hip but straight to Cook at short leg who aims a throw back to the stumps"
55,"Tremlett to Ponting, (no ball) Tremlett angles one down the leg side, no ball too, and it slips off the thigh pad for a boundary"
56,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run wrong line again, sliding down the leg side"
57,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run this time Tremlett reverts to the outside off-stump attack and it's left alone"
58,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run touch short, and again this is angling past the leg stump, Ponting aims a pull shot but doesn't connect"
59,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run much better ball, fuller and straighter and Ponting defends in a hurry"
60,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run ooh, extra bounce has Ponting hopping in defence, the ball then trickles back just the off stump"
61,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run massive appeal from Tremlett as he lands a fuller ball that traps Ponting on the pad, it was heading over and missing leg though so England were right not to review"
62,"Anderson to Hughes, no run the sun is out in Melbourne now but Anderson is still finding some movement and Hughes defends carefully"
63,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Anderson will begin to curse his luck how, Hughes defends and the ball bobbles back and bounces just over the top of the stumps"
64,"Anderson to Hughes, no run massive appeal and a review from England! They thought they had Hughes out caught down the leg side but replays showed it brushed nothing but a shirt, so England lose a review"
65,"Anderson to Hughes, no run very firm in defence now, Hughes has his movements in better order now that he's been in for a while"
66,"Anderson to Hughes, no run touch of inswing finds a hopping Hughes in defence, Hughes does enjoy a hop though"
67,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Anderson has bowled very well this spell but still has no rewards as Hughes defends well"
68,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run good start from Bresnan, finds the length and line that he's in the side to bowl, and Ponting defends"
69,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run definite swing for Bresnan early on, starts a touch too wide though and Ponting can leave comfortably"
70,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run this time the line is awry, shoved well down leg"
71,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run full and straight, Ponting jabs out a defence and Bresnan fields smartly off his own bowling"
72,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run up and around off stump, touch too wide to interest Ponting, who leaves alone expansively"
73,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run good hustle from Bresnan, finds an off-stump line just short of a good length and Ponting defends"
74,"Anderson to Hughes, no run Hughes looks a touch hurried but he's getting into good positions to defend now"
75,"Anderson to Hughes, 3 runs more runs for Hughes, he's dangerous when he has room outside off, throws his arms at it, playing it well and only the snail-like outfield prevents four"
76,"Anderson to Ponting, no run good signs for Ponting here, leaving alone the sort of delivery close to off stump that he fences at very early in his innings normally"
77,"Anderson to Ponting, FOUR runs that's an even better sign! Really good shot this, Anderson was only a fraction short and Ponting eased into a classic Ponting pull shot, in front of square for four"
78,"Anderson to Ponting, no run solid and sturdy defence this time, almost as emphatic as the pull shot"
79,"Anderson to Ponting, FOUR runs short again, pulled again, four again! Fantastic stuff from Ponting, he's earned a big cheer from the crowd and rightly so, Anderson only a touch short and Ponting was all over him"
80,"Bresnan to Hughes, OUT Bresnan has his first Ashes wicket and Hughes has gone. Full and wide, inviting a slash but Hughes didn't get enough of it, instead the edge flew straight to Pietersen who made no mistake in the gully"
81,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run nervy start for Clarke, who is neither forward nor back as he drops a defensive stroke towards cover"
82,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run leaning forward in defence from deep in the crease, Clarke defends back to the bowler"
83,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Clarke is getting into line with increasing confidence, and defends towards mid-off this time"
84,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Bresnan pulls the length slightly shorter, Clarke blocks under his eyes into the off side"
85,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run short from Bresnan, but that's much too short to bother Clarke and he's easily underneath it"
86,"Tremlett to Ponting, no run chopped down to gully, Ponting riding the bounce on a back-of-a-length delivery"
87,"Tremlett to Ponting, OUT gone! Tremlett strikes again, what a delivery. Spitting off a length and going away off the seam, Ponting is rooted to the crease and pushes at the delivery. A thick edge flies straight to Graeme Swann"
88,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run solid defence from Hussey first up"
89,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run and he follows that up with a judicious leave, stepping across to off stump and letting this one past"
90,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run that's well-judged once again, Hussey leaving on length this time. The ball pitched and seamed back in to him, but was short enough to be safely left alone"
91,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run emotive appeal from Tremlett as he goes fuller and straighter and Hussey is rapped on the back pad. And Strauss asks for a review ... but that's going over the top. It him him well above the knee-roll. And England have used up all their reviews for this innings"
92,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run nibbling away off the seam, Clarke steps across and shoulders arms"
93,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run tapped just to gully's right, and Clarke is called through for a tight single ... the throw at the non-striker's end is wide though, and Clarke is off the mark"
94,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run full on off stump, Hussey leans forward into a solid defence"
95,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run half an appeal from Bresnan as ball ricochets off pad once again ... but Aleem Dar says no, and England have no reviews. Probably going down, by the looks of the replay. Late swing in to the left-hander there"
96,"Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run neatly tucked down to fine leg"
97,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run tempting line outside off, but Clarke opts for caution and leaves alone"
98,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run full and aimed right at off stump, Hussey punches defensively to cover"
99,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run well-left. Hussey's leaving was a feature of his innings at Perth - even catching Geoffrey Boycott's eye - and he's shown good judgement so far today"
100,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run slanted even wider across the batsman, no need to play at that"
101,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run again Tremlett pushes one across him, just short of a good length. Left again. Is Hussey being set up for the one that comes back into the pads?"
102,"Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs it appears not! Tremlett dishes up a gift on off stump, and Hussey drives a long half-volley to the extra cover boundary. He looks in good touch"
103,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run and another watchful leave to end the over"
104,"Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs neatly punched between mid-off and cover by Clarke, the ball is pulled up well short of the rope but that was a confident stroke. Pushed through the gap on the up"
105,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run bad line from Bresnan, on the toes and flicked to fine leg"
106,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run yet another harmless delivery is easily left by Hussey. England need to get him playing early on"
107,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run that's better, on a length and straight and Hussey is drawn into a hurried defence"
108,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run fuller still, but nice and straight once more and Hussey is slightly squared up as he defends to off"
109,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run landing short of a length on off and going further off the seam, Hussey is quite happy to leave"
110,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run probing length from Tremlett, this would've crashed into the off stump had Clarke not jammed down to defend it"
111,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 leg bye off the pad and trickling down to short fine leg, and they're through for a leg bye"
112,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett pulls the length back to get the ball popping up towards Hussey's ribs, but the batsman rides the bounce to play the ball straight down on the leg side"
113,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett errs slightly in line, and Hussey shoulders arms to one outside off"
114,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett attacks the stumps and immediately appears a far more dangerous prospect ... ball thumps into pad as Hussey lunges forward, but there's a massive inside edge involved"
115,"Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs another testing delivery, curving back in to the pads through the air and nudged into the leg side at midwicket"
116,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run dug in very short on off stump, Clarke ducks quickly underneath it"
117,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run this one comes in off the seam slightly after pitching on a length and straight, Clarke nudges into the leg side"
118,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Clarke steps forward, looking for the on-drive, but he's not to the pitch of it and a thick inside edge rolls to mid-on"
119,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Bresnan invites the drive outside off this time, but Clarke won't be tempted and leaves well alone"
120,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run similar ball, this time Clarke pushes the bat out at it to send the ball towards backward point"
121,"Bresnan to Clarke, FOUR runs in the air, but in the gap between slip and gully! That flew off the bat as he threw himself into a cut, and went fast and possibly too high to be caught anyway. Either way, it brings up Australia's 50"
122,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run yet another studied leave from Hussey, he could do this all day"
123,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run again Tremlett pushes this just too far from off to get Hussey playing. The ball does swing back in through the air, but only really once it has passed him"
124,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run left alone once more, this one really went off the seam back in to Hussey. Left on length, as that shot over middle and off"
125,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett has got to pitch it up here, fourth leave in four for Hussey"
126,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run and pitch it up he does. Hussey is caught at the crease as he defends, but the ball pings off a defensive blade"
127,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run rare play and a miss from Hussey! First error in judgement he's made today. He might have left this as well, but just thrust the bat out at it with his weight back"
128,"Bresnan to Clarke, FOUR runs shot! Full on middle and off, and Clarke leans into a cracking straight drive"
129,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run was that held back a touch by Bresnan? It looked like it may have been the leg cutter. Defended to extra cover"
130,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run on a length but just too wide to have Clarke playing"
131,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run identical ball, and the response from the batsman is the same too"
132,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run this one comes back in off the seam, but it lands quite wide once again and he leaves safely enough"
133,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run landing on off stump this time, and fuller too. Clarke defends into the off side"
134,"Swann to Hussey, no run darting this one in at off stump to start, and Hussey leans forward to defend right under the nose"
135,"Swann to Hussey, no run pitching slightly wider of off and kicked away by Hussey. That seemed to grip just a touch, definitely something there"
136,"Swann to Hussey, no run speared in much quicker through the air, and rushing on with the arm. Defended by Hussey"
137,"Swann to Hussey, no run this time the batsman uses his feet, getting nicely to the pitch and whipping to midwicket ... but straight to the fielder, who immediately fires in a return to have Hussey hurrying back to the crease"
138,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey stretches out to smother this one"
139,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run slipping just down the leg side, and it's tickled round the corner for a single"
140,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run pushed right across Hussey from over the wicket, landing outside off and going even further and there's no way he's going to play at that"
141,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run Bresnan straightens his line but Hussey is watchful in defence, bristling with nerdish intensity even as he defends"
142,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run left on length this time, just too short there"
143,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run fuller, but wider again and Hussey wisely has nothing to do with it"
144,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run Bresnan attacks the stumps, but the bat comes down in vertical defence"
145,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run and - surprise, surprise - an exemplary leave to finish the over"
146,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke makes his intentions to the offspinner clear straight away, dancing down the track and driving hard to cover"
147,"Swann to Clarke, no run again he's down the track, tapping to mid-on this time"
148,"Swann to Clarke, no run this time Clarke stays very deep in the crease, defending behind square on the off side"
149,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke uses his feet once again, pushing the ball back to the bowler"
150,"Swann to Clarke, no run and again, he doesn't quite get to the pitch but does enough to smother the spin"
151,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke keeps his weight back and aims a delicate late cut through gully, but a diving Pietersen cuts it off"
152,"Anderson to Hussey, no run loosener to start, curving away from Hussey who leaves alone"
153,"Anderson to Hussey, OUT edged! Anderson strikes straight away, and what a delivery to do it with. Landing on middle and off and shooting towards the slips, the length was full and Hussey was drawn into the drive, getting a good, healthy edge that flies through to Prior"
154,"Anderson to Smith, no run and this one curves away to tease the outside edge of Smith's bat first ball!"
155,"Anderson to Smith, no run full and straight on the resumption from Anderson, Smith flicks to leg, looking like a man who's wandered out to the middle from a bar, odd style but this was firmly played"
156,"Anderson to Smith, 3 runs Smith is away, and in some style too, driving crisply square of the wicket on the off side, the outfield is as slow as a Turkish arthouse film so Smith doesn't get the boundary he deserves"
157,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs neatly played by Clarke this time, flicking to leg with a touch more grace than Smith managed for a couple more"
158,"Bresnan to Smith, no run Smith as usual gets into a funny position to defend a length ball, but does so well"
159,"Bresnan to Smith, no run this keeps a fraction low, Smith was hanging back which made the whole thing look even more dangerous, as it was he defended quite securely"
160,"Bresnan to Smith, 3 runs lovely shot for three here, gets the slightest bit of width outside off and punches a back-foot drive through extra cover"
161,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run touch too short from Bresnan, but if his job is to defend than back of a length is the best option, Clarke gets into a good position, right behind the ball, to defend"
162,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run word from the Australian camp is that the pitch is a bit two paced, which sounds like a bad excuse for 4 for 66, but this sticks in the track a bit and means Clarke's defence is slightly airy to mid-off"
163,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run solid, sturdy defence to finish the over, again it's a touch too short from Bresnan to be a wicket-taking length"
164,"Anderson to Smith, no run nothing back of a length from Anderson, he's on the lookout for swing, and finds some here, late and back into Smith, who gets nowhere near this and it thuds him on the pads"
165,"Anderson to Smith, no run Smith has a good eye and looks like he has good hands too, makes up for a quirky technique, he defends here with his hands way away from his body"
166,"Anderson to Smith, no run good judgement sees this left well alone outside off"
167,"Anderson to Smith, no run this time Anderson's length is wrong - too short - and the line it a touch wide as well"
168,"Anderson to Smith, no run waa? This almost went through the stumps! Smith leaves alone and watches in horror as the ball snakes back and goes just over the top of middle"
169,"Anderson to Smith, no run nicely driven but straight to cover, another maiden for Anderson"
170,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Bresnan bustles up to the crease, and hits the bat hard, he's a euphemism type of bowler"
171,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run splice-hitting length and line, no real danger for Clarke"
172,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run this is left alone outside off stump"
173,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run Bresnan finds a fuller length for the first time since lunch, but also locates the middle of Clarke's defensive blade"
174,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run careful, head-over-ball defiance from Clarke"
175,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run another maiden, good work from Bresnan, Clarke's defence is solid"
176,"Anderson to Smith, no run ooh, England have no reviews left, if they did you reckon Strauss would be all over it here, inswinger from Anderson traps Smith on the crease, big inside edge though"
177,"Anderson to Smith, no run outside off stump this time, Smith is sensible enough to leave alone"
178,"Anderson to Smith, OUT Smith gone now, always looked a matter of time, pushed very hard at this outside off, touch of nibble away off the pitch found the edge and Prior did the rest"
179,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs edged straight away, but Haddin gets four, big gap between second slip and gully and this runs along the ground straight through it to the third man rope"
180,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run Haddin is on his way straight away, driving sweetly wide of mid-off, Haddin has a way of getting under England's skin, his way is quite simple actually, score runs and tell the England boys all about every one of them"
181,"Anderson to Clarke, no run careful and calm defence from Clarke to finish another wicket-taking over"
182,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run straight ball meets a very straight bat, Haddin timing a defensive block perfectly to mid-on"
183,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run Bresnan offers a bit of hit-me width, but Haddin is prepared to get his eye in and leave alone"
184,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run lovely delivery this, fuller length and Bresnan finds some away movement, sneaks past a nervy push from Haddin"
185,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run swing from the bowler, swing from the batsman, not a great shot, just a waft outside off stump"
186,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run this time Haddin leaves alone, almost to punish himself for the previous shot"
187,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter from Bresnan and it earns him his fifth maiden in 10 overs, fine work from him"
188,"Anderson to Clarke, no run this is a touch outside off stump and Clarke wants nothing to do with it"
189,"Anderson to Clarke, no run lovely delivery, Anderson swinging it this way and that, not sure Clarke knows which way it's going, this bends in and crashes into the inner thigh"
190,"Anderson to Clarke, no run enough width to give Clarke the luxury of a leave"
191,"Anderson to Clarke, no run fuller and attacking the stumps, Clarke very studious in defence back to the bowler"
192,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run yorker attempted, doesn't quite get it full enough and Clarke flicks it down to Tremlett at fine leg"
193,"Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs nicely played here, banged in short and Clarke's pull shot was controlled down to midwicket for a couple"
194,"Bresnan to Clarke, 3 runs ooh, iffy drive from Clarke, just throwing his hands at some width outside off, it flew wide of Morgan at point who leapt in classic salmon fashion but just couldn't reach it"
195,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run very firm and classy drive straight back down the ground, Bresnan tumbles inelegantly but saves runs as he fields"
196,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run pushed into the off side"
197,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run clipped firmly to mid-on, no run but the sort of shot that should settle the frazzled Australian nerves"
198,"Anderson to Clarke, no run touch loose again from Clarke, just flinging his arms at this outside off, comes off an inside edge and runs to mid-on"
199,"Anderson to Clarke, no run this time Clarke reverts back to leaving the ball"
200,"Anderson to Clarke, no run Anderson has settled into a perfect groove and Clarke can do nothing but defend"
201,"Anderson to Clarke, OUT brilliant bowling from Anderson, he's just worked Clarke over with consistent, probing away swing and this time it finds the edge, Clarke pushing at the ball, feathered edge and Prior collects the simple chance. Australia in total disarray"
202,"Anderson to Johnson, no run but here Anderson finds a length, line and a defensive blade before spinning on his heels and marching back to his mark. 'Can't talk now, I have wickets to take'"
203,"Anderson to Johnson, no run careful defence from Johnson to end a fine, fine over"
204,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run Haddin is a wanton driver, just can't resist it, and why would he when he plays the shot so well? Sadly for him, he finds a diving Ian Bell at short cover here"
205,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run good delivery here, just enough away nibble to make Haddin's drive uncertain"
206,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run swing for Bresnan, plenty of it but from the hand, swing from Haddin too as he drives to point"
207,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run Bresnan's hard work is rewarded with an outside edge, but it runs along the ground to point"
208,"Bresnan to Haddin, OUT Bresnan has another and Haddin has gifted him this, flat-footed waft of a drive, flicked the edge and went through to Strauss. Pretty miserable stuff this from the home side"
209,"Bresnan to Harris, no run Bresnan locates an off-stump line and Harris somehow jabs a bat down on time, another maiden from Bresnan but this time with the added sauce of wicket"
210,"Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson surely has to have a go now, but he won't reach this, slid down the leg side"
211,"Anderson to Johnson, OUT Anderson has his man! Johnson's gone for a duck, this is a cracking delivery, seams away off a full length, finds the edge and Prior has his fourth catch"
212,"Anderson to Siddle, no run you can always expect a scrap from Siddle, here he leaves alone outside off stump. Sounds obvious, but his colleagues haven't managed it"
213,"Anderson to Siddle, 1 run big cheer as Siddle gets one, working down to fine leg for a single"
214,"Anderson to Harris, no run Harris this time watches the line outside off stump and leaves well alone"
215,"Anderson to Harris, no run good delivery to finish the over, swinging in and Harris defends carefully"
216,"Bresnan to Siddle, no run Bresnan goes full and straight and Siddle defends"
217,"Bresnan to Siddle, FOUR runs rare bad ball from Bresnan and Siddle takes full toll, nothing expansive, just a leg-stump line tickled down to fine leg for four"
218,"Bresnan to Siddle, no run having gone leg side once Bresnan makes sure this is outside off stump"
219,"Bresnan to Siddle, no run push and a miss outside off, bit of a tailender prod there"
220,"Bresnan to Siddle, no run Siddle corrects himself after the last delivery by leaving alone"
221,"Bresnan to Siddle, no run has it carried? Don't think it has, Swann, who collected the edge, wasn't sure. Bresnan found the outside edge as Siddle pushed outside off stump, went very low and probably carried to Swann, but on replay these things are rarely given out"
222,"Anderson to Harris, FOUR runs four for Harris, I'm not sure he knew much about it, just swished across the line, got a top edge that sailed over the slips down to the third man rope"
223,"Anderson to Harris, no run first sledge of the day from Anderson, probably deserves to as well, lovely ball zips past the edge"
224,"Anderson to Harris, no run umpire Dar has called this a dead ball, much to Harris's annoyance because an inswinger clipped the thigh and ran away for four, but Harris was so late on the attempted nurdle that Dar thought he hadn't played a shot"
225,"Anderson to Harris, no run left alone studiously outside off stump"
226,"Anderson to Harris, no run England have barely bowled any short balls this innings, very good discipline, Harris blocks another full delivery"
227,"Anderson to Harris, no run left alone quietly outside off stump. It's been all England since lunch and they can reward themselves with a drink. Liam will be here after the break"
228,"Tremlett to Siddle, 3 runs long half volley from Tremlett to start, and it's slapped through the covers by Australia's No. 10"
229,"Tremlett to Harris, no run Tremlett straightens his line and pulls the length back a touch, Harris stays at the crease to defend"
230,"Tremlett to Harris, no run seaming in to thump into the front pad this time, but that's too high and heading down the leg side too"
231,"Tremlett to Harris, no run Harris has an airy swish outside off, and is lucky not to get an edge on this"
232,"Tremlett to Harris, no run forced out towards cover point, where there is a slight misfield ... but not enough to warrant chancing a single upon"
233,"Anderson to Siddle, no run snaking away through the air, but outside off and easily left alone"
234,"Anderson to Siddle, no run landing on a length on off stump, tapped defensively to cover"
235,"Anderson to Siddle, 3 runs slapped with rather more intent this time, the ball beats a diving cover fielder but rolls to a halt in the outfield"
236,"Anderson to Harris, no run good, testing follow-up ball. But Harris is solid in defence"
237,"Anderson to Harris, no run and again, Anderson keeping it tight but Harris is hanging in there doggedly"
238,"Anderson to Harris, no run and nudged gently into the leg side to end"
239,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run beaten outside the off stump as Tremlett maintains an impeccable line. Possibly too good for the facing batsman..."
240,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run Siddle whips the bat out of the way this time"
241,"Tremlett to Siddle, OUT there we go, another one is on his way and Australia are nine down. Tremlett pitches one up invitingly outside off, a touch of movement through the air and off the pitch takes the ball away from the bat and a regulation edge lands safely in Prior's gloves. His fifth catch today"
242,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run Tremlett bursts another one past a tailender's outside edge, finding a great length: full on off stump"
243,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run now he uses his height, this is back of a length and jags towards the slips off the seam. Acres of sunlight between bat and ball"
244,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run a yorker goes awry and ends up as a full toss on off stump, which Hilfenhaus biffs to mid-off"
245,"Anderson to Harris, no run nicely done by Harris, who is tight in defence"
246,"Anderson to Harris, FOUR runs good shot there, the ball was there to be hit - short and wide - but Harris didn't try to make too much of hit, just getting himself into a good, balanced position on the back foot and scything a cut through gully"
247,"Anderson to Harris, no run swinging in, Harris takes this one the thigh pad as he tries to work to leg"
248,"Anderson to Harris, 2 runs this time he gets bat on it, clipping to square leg"
249,"Anderson to Harris, no run defended straight back into the pitch with a vertical bat"
250,"Anderson to Harris, no run again curving in late through the air, Harris can't get a touch on an attempted leg glance and is struck on the pad. Heading way down leg though, not even a hint of an appeal"
251,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run banged in, 'Tremors' keeps Hilfenhaus pegged back with a lifting delivery outside off"
252,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run back of a length once more, Hilfenhaus pokes at it and then whips his bat inside the line at the last moment"
253,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run that is simply too good for a No. 11, landing full on off stump and moving away off the seam. Beaten."
254,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run ball hits bat this time, as Tremlett attacks the stumps but Hilfenhaus manages to keep him out"
255,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, OUT all over, Australia are out for 98 as Hilfenhaus feathers a sixth catch through to Prior"
256,"That's tea in Melbourne. The hosts are all out for their lowest score against England at the MCG since Test cricket's very first game, way back in 1877. They've simply been blown away by seam and swing bowling of the highest standard. There are no real demons in this pitch - it's not hooping around corners. England were just the more disciplined team out there today. They"
257,"Hilfenhaus is well into his run with Trott still scratching at his mark ... the bowler arrives at the crease but the batsmen is not ready, so he'll have to try this one again"
258,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run Hilfenhaus on the mark straight away, zoning in on off stump as Trott defends"
259,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run width offered this time, but the cut shot goes straight to point"
260,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run this one curves in through the air and may have kept a little low. Trott gets the bat down in good time to defend, however"
261,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 1 run tapped into the gap at cover, and they take the chance for a quick single"
262,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run Prior leans into an aggressive drive ... the ball goes nowhere though, he's not found the middle of the bat with much regularity yet"
263,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run very full on off stump, dug out to mid-off"
264,"Johnson to Trott, no run full of length to start from Johnson, and Trott drives gently to mid-on"
265,"Johnson to Trott, no run Johnson keeps the ball in Trott's half, this time the drive goes into the off side"
266,"Johnson to Trott, no run Trott looks for runs at midwicket with that characteristic shuffling clip, but picks out the field"
267,"Johnson to Trott, 1 run short on off stump, but not quite the bouncer and Trott is in no trouble getting right on top of the ball and pulling down to fine leg"
268,"Johnson to Prior, no run moving towards the slips slightly after pitching, chopped down to gully"
269,"Johnson to Prior, no run pushed fuller and wider by Johnson, too wide to play a controlled shot to and Prior wisely opts to leave alone"
270,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run full outside off, Trott can't break through the off-side field with the drive however"
271,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run straighter and shorter of length this time, Trott presents the full face to push the ball to mid-on"
272,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, FOUR runs four runs! Hilfenhaus was aiming for the surprise yorker but just got it slightly wrong and sent the ball down the leg side. Is that bat or pad? Given as runs"
273,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run ouch! A thick inside edge cannons into the inside of Trott's knee, behind the pad. He's down immediately and looks to be in some pain. Prior calls the physio out straight away ... he's flexing the knee now, and is up once again. He hasn't asked for a runner, just a couple of painkillers and a sip of water"
274,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run width on the ball invites the forcing shot through the off side, but the ball goes straight to the man at point"
275,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run pinged down right at off stump, Trott gets into line to defend"
276,"Johnson to Prior, no run testing line and good pace from Johnson, Prior stays deep in the crease and plays the ball down behind square on the off side"
277,"Johnson to Prior, 1 run short from Johnson, but down the leg side and the ball is hooked down to fine leg ... all along the ground"
278,"Johnson to Trott, no run fuller, Trott shuffles across to off and drives to mid-on"
279,"Johnson to Trott, 3 runs full and wide, Trott places the drive in front of cover point and picks up three runs"
280,"Johnson to Prior, no run on a length, defended into the off side"
281,"Johnson to Prior, no run leaving the batsman off the pitch, Prior plays away from the body to guide the ball to point"
282,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run hint of inswing from Hilfenhaus, Trott plays watchfully to mid-on. He bends and flexes the knee after playing the shot, and still looks to be in considerable discomfort after that blow"
283,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 1 run flicked down to fine leg for one"
284,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run keeping a touch low and moving in through the air, Prior is back when he should be forward but manages to keep it out all the same"
285,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run a flowing drive ... but the timing is completely off and the ball trickles slowly to mid-on"
286,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs top-edged pull, and the ball balloons over Haddin's head! Down to the boundary, four more for Prior"
287,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs Hilfenhaus is mixing his lengths up well here, going very full again. He doesn't quite hit the yorker mark, though, and Prior works the ball through the leg side field"
288,"Harris to Trott, no run a real loosener first up, not much pace at all as Trott leaves outside off. Harris still manages to get it through to Haddin without a bounce"
289,"Harris to Trott, no run short of a good length, Trott gets back and across and jabs the ball hard back down the wicket"
290,"Harris to Trott, no run another inside edge onto the inside of the left leg! This one hits the pad though. Trott can see the funny side, smiling as he walks away from the wicket. He's been in the wars in the last few overs"
291,"Harris to Trott, FOUR runs superb on-drive from Trott! Mid-on was wide, so he went straight and got great timing and placement on the shot"
292,"Harris to Trott, 1 run Trott picks up the length early, getting across to work the ball off his hip and out through square leg"
293,"Harris to Prior, FOUR runs slashed in the air through gully! The shot was on as the ball was short and wide, and Prior went through with it. That brings up the fifty partnership"
294,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 1 run nudged into the leg side, splitting the field for a single"
295,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run full, Prior squirts a sliced drive towards point ... it was briefly in the air but falling well short"
296,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run jabbed defensively down behind square on the leg side, the ball taking the inner half of the bat, and Trott calls him through for a quick single"

298,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run full on off stump from Hilfenhaus this time, driven to mid-on"
299,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 1 run strange little shot, almost a tennis forehand, but straight down towards midwicket. One run the result"
300,"Harris to Trott, no run wide, not quite full enough for the drive and Trott toe-ends into the covers"
301,"Harris to Trott, no run very full this time, perhaps the attempted yorker from Harris. It tailed in through the air, too, but Trott was equal to it and dug the ball out into the off side"
302,"Harris to Trott, no run nicely driven this time, but picking the extra cover fielder"
303,"Harris to Trott, no run gentle seam movement away from the bat off a good length, but wide of off and easily left alone"
304,"Harris to Trott, no run fuller and wider still, Trott leans forward into a classical leave"
305,"Harris to Trott, no run after such a good leave, just a bit of a nothing shot from Trott. It was full and wide and he might well have left it - or aimed a drive into the covers. He did neither, just pushing the bat softly out and letting the ball hit it"
306,"Clarke to Prior, 1 run flat on leg stump to start, Prior is cautious as he taps it down behind square"
307,"Clarke to Trott, 2 runs Clarke continues from round the wicket, nudged down to fine leg"

310,"Clarke to Trott, 1 run speared down the leg side, another easy single taken"

315,"Harris to Prior, no run straighter this time, nudged to midwicket"
316,"Harris to Prior, no run this one holds its line outside off, and Prior is beaten on the outside edge as he aims a loose-looking drive into the off side"
317,"Harris to Prior, no run beaten once again outside off, good bowling from Harris here"
318,"Clarke to Trott, 1 run worked off the pads to one of those boundary riders on the leg side"

328,"Harris to Trott, no run wide outside off stump and Trott has a dart, flashing and missing"
329,"Harris to Trott, no run good tactics from Australia, trying to dry Trott up in the 90s by landing outside off, Trott happy to have a go but keeps picking out fielders"
330,"Clarke to Prior, 1 run something approaching flight from Clarke, rewarded with a handsome drive out to deep cover for a strolled single"
331,"Clarke to Trott, 1 run Trott's trusty inside edge earns him a single into the square leg region"
332,"Clarke to Prior, 1 run Prior this time works to leg for a strike-turner. This is turning into a a milk"
333,"Clarke to Trott, 1 run yup, the milking of Clarke has begun, Trott picking off a riskless single to deep midwicket"
334,"Clarke to Prior, no run this time Prior can only defend with a full face back to the bowler"
335,"Clarke to Prior, no run patted back down the pitch to end a gentle over"
336,"Harris to Trott, no run Harris has settled into a decent groove here and hurries Trott in defence around off stump"
337,"Harris to Trott, no run Harris fires another up outside off and Trott happily driving to cover"
338,"Harris to Trott, 1 run this time the drive pierces the ring of offside fielders, gets Trott a single to take him to 95"
339,"Harris to Prior, no run Prior has a flat-footed poke outside off, nothing shot but it looked worse thanks to the low bounce through to Haddin"
340,"Harris to Prior, no run this is stroked with a clock-shop full of timing but straight to mid-off"
341,"Harris to Prior, 1 run very swift single keeps Trott off strike as Prior smoothly strokes another off-drive to a fullish delivery"

343,"Smith to Prior, no run bowler lucky to get away with this, dragged down very short but it stuck in the pitch and Prior couldn't time his cut"
344,"Smith to Prior, no run this is a touch short again but the cut shot finds point"
345,"Smith to Prior, no run ah, much better, fuller with more air and Prior defends with utmost respect"
346,"Smith to Prior, no run shorter length means some spin from around leg stump, Prior stands tall and blocks"
347,"Smith to Prior, no run maiden over ends with Prior pushing gently back to the bowler"
348,"Harris to Trott, 2 runs lovely stroke, Harris has been feeding Trott drives outside off and this one is timed very well into a gap at extra cover for a couple"
349,"Harris to Trott, FOUR runs that is a superb hundred from Trott, gets there fittingly with a leg-side flick off his toes through the midwicket region for four, celebrates with his customary single arm lofted in the air. It's been a pretty chanceless knock and he's helping take England out of sight here"
350,"Harris to Trott, no run ideal post-hundred delivery for the batsman, outside off stump and left alone"
351,"Harris to Trott, no run Trott is forced to play at this but does so with consummate ease in defence"
352,"Harris to Trott, FOUR runs four more! Not where he intended but a full ball finds the outside edge of a loose drive, it sped past the slips to the third man boundary"
353,"Harris to Trott, 1 run this is driven again, but more carefully to cover for a single"
354,"Smith to Trott, 1 run Smith floats up a full ball on Trott's toes which can only mean one thing - a leg-side nurdle for one"

361,"Siddle to Prior, no run full and outside off, looking to draw Prior into a drive but the batsman is having none of it"
362,"Siddle to Prior, no run this time Prior does have a nibble, pushing at the ball outside off in a very Australia-in-the-first-innings type of way, luckily for the batsman it beats the edge"
363,"Siddle to Prior, no run good length from Siddle, imploring Prior to have a dart, this is steered to point"
364,"Siddle to Prior, no run Siddle happy to continue with a drive-me length and Prior equally happy to keep playing the shot, picks out cover though"
365,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs width, width was all Prior needed to free his arms and time a square drive behind point for four"
366,"Smith to Trott, no run Smith going around the wicket now, looking to land it in some rough, Trott is not bothered and defends from the back foot"
367,"Smith to Trott, 1 run Trott has scored plenty off his legs, and gets another here as Smith's line errs"

373,"Siddle to Trott, FOUR runs Trott gets four for this but he looked hurried on the shot, steering a back-cut past the slips to the third man rope, the extra bounce meant he lost his bottom hand as he played the shot but still controlled it well"

375,"Siddle to Trott, no run Siddle hugging off stump with his line but only to find the middle of a secure defensive blade"
376,"Siddle to Trott, 2 runs maybe a sign of indrift here, but the line was too close to Trott's pads and he flicked two more wide of fine leg"
377,"Siddle to Trott, no run this keeps a touch low, which is the sort of thing which will excite England no end, Trott jabs away a defence"
378,"Smith to Prior, 1 run too short again from Smith and it is cut to deep cover"

399,"Siddle to Trott, no run just short of a good length, tapped defensively to leg"

415,"Smith to Trott, 1 run tapped out through cover point for an undramatic single"

418,"Smith to Trott, no run tapped back to the bowler"
419,"Smith to Trott, FOUR runs such timing! This was nothing more than a firm push down the ground, but it beat the bowler and once it was past mid-on, raced away!"
420,"Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs up and over gully! It was a short ball from Johnson that rose up at Prior and took the shoulder of the bat, looping high over the slip cordon. Ponting just stands and shakes his head at the injustice of it all"
421,"Johnson to Prior, 1 run very full this time, driven hard out to deep point"
422,"Johnson to Trott, no run Johnson slams the ball down at his feet and the ball balloons high over Trott. Is that not a wide? Apparently not"

424,"Johnson to Trott, 1 run dropped into the covers for one"
425,"Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs a controlled, placed late cut from Prior sends the ball down to the third man boundary. He started in scratchy fashion but seems to have settled in nicely since then"
426,"Watson to Trott, 2 runs short to start, and Trott aims a swivel-pull down to that man at fine leg"
427,"Watson to Trott, no run fuller this time, driven back to the bowler"
428,"Watson to Trott, no run gentle inswing from Watson, Trott defends to mid-on"
429,"Watson to Trott, no run this time Trott is looking for runs on the leg side, but a well-played glance finds the fielder"
430,"Watson to Trott, no run swinging in to the off stump, pushed to mid-on"
431,"Watson to Trott, no run solid defence to cover"
432,"Johnson to Prior, 1 leg bye nudged close on the leg side, there is some hesitation before the single is taken ... Johnson charges through and aims the ball towards the stumps with his right boot, but it goes wide. Would've been in all the same"
433,"Johnson to Trott, no run a harmless bouncer sails over Trott's head"
434,"Johnson to Trott, no run there's some spice from Johnson! A much better ball than the last, he gets this one to rise from just short of a good length. Past the outside edge"
435,"Johnson to Trott, FOUR runs paddle-pull to another short ball, Hilfenhaus runs round at fine leg to cut it off but the ball evades him, much to the Barmy Army's amusement"
436,"Johnson to Trott, no run another wasted short ball that bounces high over the batsman. No danger"
437,"Johnson to Trott, no run and another bouncer to finish, this time a reasonable one. A mixed over from Johnson, to say the least"
438,"Watson to Prior, no run on a length on or around off stump, Prior defends to cover"
439,"Watson to Prior, FOUR runs a loopy half-volley outside off is creamed away through cover, Prior down on one knee to play the shot. And that's their 150 partnership"

443,"Watson to Trott, no run curling in from outside off, defended into the leg side"

448,"Johnson to Prior, no run left alone outside off"
449,"Johnson to Prior, no run very full but still wide outside off, Prior thinks about the drive but this late in the day opts instead for caution and leaves alone"

454,"Watson to Prior, no run full and swinging in, defended to point once again"
455,"Watson to Prior, no run defended back down the track ... and we will have one more over"
456,"Johnson to Trott, no run good length, but well wide of off and Trott is only too happy to leave alone. A wasted delivery"
457,"Johnson to Trott, no run back of a length and angled into the body this time, Trott stays deep in the crease and works into the leg side"
458,"Johnson to Trott, no run outside off, Trott leans into his umpteenth leave of the day"
459,"Johnson to Trott, no run straighter, and the crowd are brought alive as Johnson collects the ball in his follow-through and threatens to throw the stumps down"
460,"Johnson to Trott, no run gentle stuff from Johnson at the end of the day, and Trott defends off the front foot"
461,"Johnson to Trott, 2 runs runs off the final ball, two of them as Trott taps a full, wide ball through cover point. They run the second and as the Australian fielders start to wander off, Trott re-marks his guard, as is his wont"
462,"Harris to Prior, no run good start from Harris, right on the money, moving away a fraction too and Prior shuffles along the crease and defends"
463,"Harris to Prior, no run again Harris finds an ideal length and line and Prior defends watchfully"
464,"Harris to Prior, no run this has been a feature of England's batting and, if you want to be fancy, you could say it separates the teams in this test, Prior judging a leave outside off stump perfectly"
465,"Harris to Prior, no run hint of some reverse here back to Prior who gets half forward to defend"
466,"Harris to Prior, no run careful defence as Harris bangs away on a length and line"
467,"Harris to Prior, no run excellent opening over from Harris, if only Australia weren't 346 behind, Prior has to defend again"
468,"Siddle to Trott, no run starts well, hitting a fullish length around off stump and Trott defends"
469,"Siddle to Trott, no run this is full again and straight, Trott is nonplussed as always and shuffles across his stumps to defend"
470,"Siddle to Trott, no run Siddle ventures outside off stump, Trott of course doesn't and leaves alone"
471,"Siddle to Trott, no run oh, tough luck for Siddle here, nips one away from a good length, finds a genuine outside edge but it falls short of Watson at first slip. Haddin might have had a go at diving across perhaps"
472,"Siddle to Trott, no run this is back to a full length on the stumps and Trott defends"
473,"Siddle to Trott, 3 runs first runs of the morning and comes not from Trott's routine leg-side nudge but instead a stylish back-foot drive square of the wicket on the off side"
474,"Harris to Trott, no run Harris continues to hammer away on a good length and line, decent wheels too, Trott defends crisply to mid-on"
475,"Harris to Trott, no run a fuller length draws Trott forward and a skewed drive finds point"
476,"Harris to Trott, no run Harris has been excellent this morning and finds a good length that Trott defends"
477,"Harris to Trott, no run sharp delivery, shaping in a touch and Trott hurries into a defensive prod"
478,"Harris to Trott, no run Trott can't resist a bit of width and flashes an edgy drive that is smartly fielded in the gully"
479,"Harris to Trott, no run maiden over for Harris and a good one too, finishes with Trott hurrying to defend"
480,"Siddle to Prior, 3 runs Siddle offers Prior width outside off, which is a long empty road for a happy driver like him, he throws his arms through the line and it requires a pair of scurrying Australians to keep it to three"
481,"Siddle to Trott, no run this is closer to the stumps and Trott watches it carefully onto his defensive blade"
482,"Siddle to Trott, no run full and straight from the bowler, much the same from the bat"

485,"Siddle to Trott, no run resolute forward defence to finish the over, not the sort of thing you want to see if you are an Australian"
486,"Harris to Prior, no run flash and a miss outside off, Prior will always have a drive if you give him half a chance, but just doesn't connect with this"
487,"Harris to Prior, no run Harris continues to hug off stump with his line and Prior has to defend"
488,"Harris to Prior, FOUR runs drive-me length and a drive-me line, Prior does the obvious and flashes a square drive past point all along the ground for four. Lovely shot"
489,"Harris to Prior, no run Harris happy to offer another drive and this one isn't timed as well and point fields"
490,"Harris to Prior, no run fuller and straighter this time, Harris looking for a yorker and Prior has to jab down a defence"
491,"Harris to Prior, 3 runs ah excellent stroke here, this was more on the up but Prior used the offer of width to ease a cover drive away"
492,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run ooh, Bresnan aims a leave but is late on it and it ends up clipping his bat as he shouldered arms"
493,"Siddle to Bresnan, 3 runs Bresnan is away with a solid clunk through midwicket, the sort of shot Prior was trying to play"
494,"Siddle to Trott, 1 run this is steered behind point for a quick single"
495,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run back of a length from Siddle and Bresnan is solid in defence"
496,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run very confident and crisp block to finish a wicket-taking over for Siddle"
497,"Harris to Trott, no run this keeps a little low outside off stump, beyond that there is little to say about the delivery"
498,"Harris to Trott, no run again this burrows through to Haddin outside off stump"
499,"Harris to Trott, 1 run Harris ventures onto a line closer to off stump line and is rewarded with a forward push to cover for one"
500,"Harris to Bresnan, no run Bresnan defends carefully on the front foot, looks in good order so far"
501,"Clarke to Bresnan, no run decent start from Clarke, finding a line around off stump and Bresnan very confidently rocks forward to defend"
502,"Clarke to Bresnan, 1 run is this Tim Bresnan or VVS Laxman? Who knows! With a flick of the wrists Bresnan turns this to midwicket for a single"
503,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run good yorker from Siddle, who is pretty much Australia's barmy one-man army, pounding in like it's the first ball of the series, Bresnan digs it out"
504,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run fullish and straightish again and Bresnan gets half forward to block"
505,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run touch of width outside off and Bresnan unfurls a classical leave"
506,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run decent line from Siddle and a touch of away nibble too, all of which doesn't trouble Bresnan who leaves alone with a flourish"
507,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run fuller and a touch of indrift finds a squeezed inside edge onto pad, Siddle began an appeal before deciding against it"
508,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run excellent over ends with Siddle hitting an off-stump line on a full length forcing Bresnan to defend carefully"
509,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run starts well enough, finding some gentle inswing, Trott shuffles across his stumps and nudges to leg"
510,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run Trott has a flash at some width outside off stump and picks out Steve Smith at point who collects and throws down the stumps, likeable fellow Smith"
511,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run good length and line as always from Hilfenhaus, but just not much devil and Trott can easily defend"
512,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run again Trott can easily defend but at least Hilfenhaus's line is good"
513,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run beaten outside off, which won't happen much now that this pitch has settled, Trott had a flat-footed waft outside off and the ball kept a touch low"
514,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run quiet over ends with more defence. It will be interesting to compare England's seamers with Australia's now that this pitch has flattened out"
515,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run significant reverse swing for Siddle here, tailing back into Bresnan, who presents a full face to the ball in defence"
516,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run bouncer this time, Bresnan shapes to duck but doesn't really need to"
517,"Siddle to Bresnan, no run ah, another lovely leave outside off, close to off stump but Bresnan picked the length and left alone"
518,"Siddle to Swann, no run Siddle searches for some reverse with a full length and Swann rocks forward to defend"
519,"Siddle to Swann, 1 leg bye Siddle finds some reverse this time, but the line starts leg side and it flicks the pad and runs down to fine leg"
520,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run bouncer to Swann, generates plenty of jeers and cheers from the crowd as Swann has to jerk out the line in a hurry"
521,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run pretty well-judged leave this outside off stump, Swann wanted to play but somehow willed himself not to"
522,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run back of a length this time and Swann stands tall to block"
523,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run touch of indrift to Swann who shaped as if he was about to try something expansive before deciding to defend"
524,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run hint of extra bouncer here outside off stump, doesn't trouble Swann who pushes to cover"
525,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run Swann is basically a front-foot driver at the crease, he plays the shot so well but when the ball is back of a length he's not so smart and here the ball zips past the edge"
526,"Johnson to Trott, 3 runs one day Australia will learn not to bowl to Trott on his pads, until then he'll clip through midwicket happily, timing it well enough to bring up his 150"
527,"Johnson to Swann, no run sharp bouncer to Swann who hops to try and duck, never understood why batsmen do that, Johnson thinks about a few words before remembering that the scoreboard might not back him up"
528,"Johnson to Swann, no run fuller this time and outside off, Swann shaped to drive but pulled out the shot"
529,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs Johnson drifts down the leg side and Swann gloves a flap at it, sending it hurrying down to the fine leg rope"
530,"Johnson to Swann, no run beaten all ends up, pushed across the right hander and ghosting past the edge"
531,"Johnson to Swann, no run and again, good over that from Johnson, pushed full and across Swann who aims a nothing sort of push and misses"
532,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run Hilfenhaus does plenty of things right as a bowler, bit of swing, good lines, good lengths but just seems to find the middle of the bat too often"
533,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run outside off stump and Trott won't play there"
534,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run touch of swing back into Trott beats his defence and raps him on the thigh but it was heading over"
535,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run once again Hilfenhaus locates the middle of a defensive bat"
536,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run carefully stroked to cover, Australia want to keep Trott at this end"
537,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run good delivery outside off stump is met with careful defence meaning that after drinks Swann will be on strike"
538,"Johnson to Swann, no run gun-barrel straight from Johnson, and Swann taps defensively back down the track"
539,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs slapped on the up through the off side! Swann doesn't need to worry much about swing from Johnson, and just swings his arms through the line of this wide delivery to send the ball bouncing away to the cover boundary"
540,"Johnson to Swann, no run straighter from Johnson, tucked off the hip"
541,"Johnson to Swann, 3 runs crashed over cover point! Full and wide from round the stumps, Swann steps well forward and scoops this over the off side field"
542,"Johnson to Trott, no run tighter line from Johnson, and Trott is utterly solid in defence"
543,"Johnson to Trott, 3 runs short and angling in to the ribs, Trott gets across and up on one leg to swivel-pull this down to fine leg. Good, controlled shot"
544,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run fullish length half a foot outside off, Trott steps forward and cracks it to point"
545,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, FOUR runs driven with purpose and poise through straight mid-off! Wonderful piece of timing on the drive as Trott steps forward and presents the full face of the bat in one fluid motion"
546,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run jabbed defensively to point once again"
547,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run Trott targets the leg side this time, but doesn't quite execute the shot well enough to get through the field"
548,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 2 runs now this will be runs, Trott shuffles across and flicks through square leg for a couple"
549,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run tapped down to gully to finish the over"
550,"Johnson to Swann, 3 runs merrily mowed over wide mid-on! It's not pretty but it's effective, pitched up and Swann went for it. A better connection would've brought him a boundary"
551,"Johnson to Trott, no run dug in short and rising over leg stump, Trott walks across and sways out of the way, briefly thinking about the hook"
552,"Johnson to Trott, 2 runs this time he does hook as Johnson sends down another bumper, a controlled stroke races down to fine leg, where a sliding Hilfenhaus does very well to stop the boundary"
553,"Johnson to Trott, 1 run fuller, nudged to midwicket for a single"
554,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs cracked over square leg! This wasn't all that short, but Swann picked up the length early and pulled it purposefully over the fielder and down to the boundary"
555,"Johnson to Swann, no run just short of a good length, but nice and straight and Swann defends"
556,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run full of length, in the channel outside off, rock solid defence to cover"
557,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run a touch shorter from Hilfenhaus, but still up to the batsman. Trott steps half-forward but stays at the crease to defend once again"
558,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run wide of off stump, tapped down to gully"
559,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run again the ball goes to gully, this time with not nearly as much control and Trott takes the bottom hand off the bat as he plays the shot. It is, perhaps, the one area that he's looked vulnerable in. Excellent seam position from Hilfenhaus, but zero swing"
560,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run tapped defensively to mid-off"
561,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run and defended to cover point to end the over, another maiden for Hilfenhaus"
562,"Johnson to Swann, 1 run short again from Johnson, hooked down to fine leg and there's the 500"
563,"Johnson to Trott, 2 runs has this just plugged in the pitch? It certainly wasn't the slower one from Johnson, but Trott was far too early into the drive and the ball flew in the air, but dropping short of mid-off"
564,"Johnson to Trott, no run tapped rather more safely along the ground to mid-off this time"
565,"Johnson to Trott, 1 run short, with a hint of width that is increased by the angle of delivery, tapped to cover point for one"
566,"Johnson to Swann, no run back of a length, dropped close in on the leg side and they briefly think about a cheeky single"
567,"Johnson to Swann, no run fuller, flapped into the leg side with plenty of bottom hand but straight to the man at wide mid-on"
568,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run short, and wide enough to invite the forcing shot through the off side. The ball goes straight to point, however"
569,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run much fuller, again Trott finds the fielder as he drives to mid-on"
570,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run dropped down defensively on the off side"
571,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run a miscued pull goes straight up in the air! But falls right in between all the converging fielders. It almost fell onto the non-striker's stumps, Hilfenhaus tried to turn in his follow-through, mid-on and mid-off rushed in and no-one could get there. That's got to be demoralising..."
572,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, 1 run cracked into the off side to rotate the strike"
573,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run good line, tucking Swann up a touch as he defends into the covers"
574,"Siddle to Trott, no run very full, and with a hint of reverse in to the batsman to start. Dug out to point"
575,"Siddle to Trott, 1 run this one hits the seam and goes the other way, tapped into the covers for one. Already there seems more life in the pitch"
576,"Siddle to Swann, 1 run just short of a good length outside off, bunted into the off side field"
577,"Siddle to Trott, no run Siddle charges in and sends one down full and wide, Trott toe-ends the drive and the ball goes nowhere"
578,"Siddle to Trott, no run definite reverse here, on a fiery yorker! That's a superb delivery, but if Trott is anything he's 'in' and spots it early to dig it out"
579,"Siddle to Trott, no run nipping in through the air and off the seam, tapped defensively to mid-on"
580,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run flat-footed swish outside off from Swann, unsurprisingly he gets nowhere near it"
581,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, 2 runs the effort ball from Hilfenhaus, banged into the pitch and rising on Swann, who pulls out to deep square"
582,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, OUT what a catch! The crowd were quiet for a good few seconds before they realised a wicket had actually just fallen. Banged in short again by Hilfenhaus, Swann hooks and a thick edge flew fast and straight and looked to be going over Haddin's head ... but he timed his salmon-leap to perfection and got both hands to it"
583,"Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, 1 run testing yorker to start, Tremlett jabs the bat down just in time and a thick inside edge goes between his legs and down on the leg side"
584,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run good length from Hilfenhaus, defended to cover"
585,"Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run Trott backs away as Hilfenhaus arrives at the crease, but is beaten outside off as he slashes at a wide one"
586,"Siddle to Tremlett, no run reversing in on a good length, but Tremlett bends down low and presents the full face of the bat in defence"
587,"Siddle to Tremlett, no run legcutter from Siddle, jagging away from the bat. Tremlett exhibits his leave"
588,"Siddle to Tremlett, no run fuller from Siddle, but wide enough to warrant another leave from Tremlett. He looks a decent No. 10"
589,"Siddle to Tremlett, no run another leave from Tremlett, he's got just over 15 minutes to survive until lunch"
590,"Siddle to Tremlett, 3 runs short of a good length and wide of off stump once again, steered down past gully and down to third man for a couple. That was quite a short ball but played practically on the front foot by the lofty Trem'"
591,"Siddle to Trott, no run full and aimed right at the off stump, Trott gives himself some room and flays a drive but finds the cover fielder"
592,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run back of a length and angling across, landing on leg stump and defended to off"
593,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run short and rising into the ribs, Anderson hops to defend to leg"
594,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run pushed much wider across the left-hander, and now we see Anderson's leave. It has neither the trimmed down efficiency of Trott's, nor the confident pomp of Pietersen's but effective enough as leaves go"
595,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run wide, and left once again"
596,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run too straight from Hilfenhaus, nudged down to fine leg"
597,"""Praveen Singh is forgetting about Hauritz who has made 2 centuries in his last 2 state test matches and a 50 in his last state ODI as well as taken quite a few wickets. Why is he off the cards?"" Who knows, Bryce. For some reason they've felt they can't pick him."

600,"Lunch So, finally Australia work their way through England's line-up. One man they didn't get past is Jonathan Trott, who finishes with a majestic, unbeaten 168. Siddle bowled with real heart and finishes with a deserved 6 for 75, but England have a lead of 415 - which is, as Miller points out, an Ashes record margin for a team batting second - and Australia will have to"
