5,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Appeal for lbw! Hoffmann is on fire. full in length, around middle and off, straightens after landing and Hayden doesn't quite lean onto his defensive prod. Must have got an inside edge. The replays show the ball hit the pad first."
6,"Blain to Gilchrist, no run Wide outside off, left alone. Two slips in place."
7,"Blain to Gilchrist, 1 run Fuller and right on the middle stump line, an attempted yorker, Gilchrist gets his bat down in a hurry, the bat-handle rotates in his hands and the ball runs through the midwicket gap"
8,"Blain to Hayden, no run Slightly short of length - Scotland continue to hit the right line and the length, on the off and middle, pushed to cover"

10,"Blain to Hayden, no run short of length, on the off and middle, Hayden gets right behind the line to defend"
11,"Blain to Hayden, 1 wide Blain gets into the Caribbean mood. Bangs this one in short, a bumper, but the line is wrong. Sails down harmlessly down the leg side."
12,"Blain to Hayden, no run Another good strangling over comes to an end. Fullish, on the middle stump line, bends in a touch, Hayden leans forward, turns it towards mid-on"
13,"Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run hones in on the off stump, angling away, Glichrist goes back, opens the bat-face, pushes it to cover point"

17,"Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run angling away from Gilchrist who lets that one go through to the 'keeper"
18,"Hoffmann to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Ooh! close. Just flies past the diving point fielder. Full and outside off, Gilchrist goes after that, clears his arms but only gets an outside edge and just about manages to clear point."
19,"Blain to Hayden, FOUR runs Caressed away! Class. Slightly overpitched, outside off and Hayden was quick to lean forward and drive it past the bowler, past mid-off and to the boundary"

26,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Shifts his length this time, back of a length and straighter. Going away from the left-hander just a shade. Hayden adjusts in the last minute and keeps it out"

28,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Straighter line, Hayden whips it square on the leg side. Tries to pinch a single but Gilchrist screams a denial"
29,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Easy run-up and smooth follow-through. A typical English action with some swing in the air. Hayden lets it go outside off"
30,"Hoffmann to Hayden, 1 wide Wide ball conceded but good swing to encourage the bowler. Starts on middle and leg and swings at a fine arc. Hayden has nothing to do with one way down leg"
31,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Left alone outside off. Good probing over that"

33,"Blain to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Typical Gilchrist response. Blain pushes it too full and Gilchrist smashes it through the extra cover region. Surely it must have burnt some grass on the way to the fence"
34,"Blain to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Ouch! Too close to the body and Gilchrist gets away with a wild slash. Thick edge flies over first slip for another boundary. Moral victory for Blain - if ever there's anything like a moral victory"
35,"Blain to Gilchrist, no run Straight and back of a length this time. Gilchrist on the back foot and defends it confidently."

39,"Hoffmann to Gilchrist, 1 run Tip and run from Gilchrist. Tapped to cover and Gilchrist steals an easy single. Short cover comes into place for Hayden"
40,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Back of a length delivery and luckily it was straight. Hayden, standing outside his crease, was lining up an almighty swing. Checked his shot in the last minute"
41,"Hoffmann to Hayden, SIX runs Blitzer! Hayden walks down the wicket nonchalantly and dismisses the ball over the long-on fence for a cracking six. Hayden at his bullying best there."
42,"Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Quite a bit of swing into the batsman. No room for Hayden, as he tries to repeat the stroke. Cramped for room and brings his bat down in the last moment. Appeal for lbw but that was going down leg"

48,"Blain to Gilchrist, 2 runs Full and on the pads, drilled easily to midwicket for a couple"
49,"Blain to Gilchrist, no run Blain back to probing outside off. That's something he has been doing really well. Gilchrist shoulders arms and has nothing to do with it"
50,"Blain to Gilchrist, no run Similar delivery and straighter. Patted back down the ground. Australia not doing anything reckless here, just going after the loose deliveries and that seems to be enough"

73,"Wright to Hayden, no run honing in on the off stump, pushed to cover region"
