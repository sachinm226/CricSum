231,"Boland to Pandey, no run shortish close to off stump, punched firmly but straight to cover point"
232,"Boland to Pandey, no run length ball angling into off stump, not much of a front-foot stride from Pandey as he looks to push through the mid-off/extra cover region, ends up inside-edging into his pad"
233,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run down the track to the flighted ball drifting away from off stump, plays the checked drive to long-off"
234,"Lyon to Pandey, FOUR runs down the track comes Pandey this time and Lyon floats it wide of off stump, giving him plenty of room to flat-bat crisply to the right of short cover"
235,"Lyon to Pandey, 1 run full on middle, clipped to deep midwicket"
236,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs tossed up on off stump and Rohit's powerful sweep beats square leg diving to his left but Marsh sprints quickly to his right from deep midwicket and makes a diving stop"

238,"Lyon to Pandey, 1 run full, close to off stump, whipped with the turn to long-on"

241,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run full outside off, Rohit can't beat cover point with his square drive"

243,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length outside off, and again he fails to beat cover point. Waited on it and steered with an open face but Finch moved quickly to his left and stopped it"
244,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run short and wide, and this time Finch dives to his right to stop that back-foot slap"
245,"Smith to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length on off stump, slides on with the angle as Rohit makes room, looking for the punch through cover. Can only push it back to the bowler"

251,"Faulkner to Pandey, 2 runs back of a length outside off, steered to the right of third man, far enough from the fielder to complete two. That's also the half-century stand"
252,"Faulkner to Pandey, 1 run short, not too much width this time, leans back and chops it to third man"
253,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs back of a length on off stump and that is smashed. Makes himself a lot of room and just flat-bats it, an inside-out tennis forehand to the left of mid-off"

255,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full, a bit of width, and again a well struck shot goes straight to a fielder, driven to short cover this time, but it's hit hard and the fielder fumbles it to allow the single"
256,"Faulkner to Pandey, 1 run back of a length on off stump, comes forward and jabs with a closed bat face to play that through square leg. Interesting-looking shot"

271,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run flighted ball outside off, presses forward and pushes into the ocvers. They go for the single as Mitchell Marsh moves quickly to his left. He picks up and throws, Pandey dives into his crease and makes it home safe. Direct hit would have had him in trouble"
272,"Lyon to Pandey, SIX runs down the track comes Pandey and Lyon gives him width once more. Lovely bat-flow through that lofted inside-out drive, and it's over the rope to the left of long-off"
273,"Lyon to Pandey, 1 run back of a length on middle and leg, goes deep in his crease to tuck it towards long leg"

278,"Marsh to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs back of a length outside off, lets it come on and steers it to the right of third man to bring up 5000 ODI runs. He's moved to a different level over the last couple of years"
279,"Marsh to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball outside off, doesn't quite come on to Rohit. Checks his drive and rolls his wrists over at the last moment to keep it down in front of mid-off"
280,"Marsh to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full on middle stump and that's dropped by Shaun Marsh. Looked to hit that over mid-off, and maybe the ball stopped on him. Bat turned in his hand and it went high over the off side. Marsh, coming in from sweeper cover, got under it and dropped a sitter. It just popped out of his hand there"
281,"Hastings to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs short and wide and that's punished. Rohit stands tall and just punches it away to the point boundary"
282,"Hastings to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length on off stump, punched to short cover"
283,"Hastings to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs length ball wide of off and that's such a sweetly timed drive to the left of short cover"

285,"Hastings to Rohit Sharma, OUT back of a length outside off, a bit of extra bounce, and Rohit goes for 99! It hurried through quicker than he expected, perhaps, as he looked to dab it towards third man, and he looks distraught when the caught behind appeal is upheld. Snicko shows the faintest of nicks, though."
286,"Hastings to Dhoni, no run gone first ball, is he? Ooh, that looked close. Much fuller this time from Hastings, excellent first ball, angling into the stumps. Dhoni shuffled across his crease instead of moving forward or back, and that ball struck him low on the pad. Not given. Maybe an inside edge, maybe struck just outside the line. R"

288,"Marsh to Dhoni, no run fuller now, drifts into the pads, clipped to long leg"

294,"Hastings to Pandey, 2 runs full on off stump and Pandey doesn't quite get hold of the lofted drive, bounces down to the right of sweeper cover. Gets two more and that's his half-century. Excellent innings under pressure, so far"
295,"Hastings to Pandey, 2 runs short ball outside off and that's a controlled pull, almost just holds his bat up and lets the ball hit it, to place it for another couple, this time through midwicket"

311,"Boland to Dhoni, no run fullish on off stump, Dhoni punches towards mid-off and short cover dives to his right to intercept"
312,"Boland to Dhoni, no run down the track and Boland straightens his line. Dhoni has to play around his front pad and misses. Ball hits pad but he's a long way down the pitch. Big appeal but it's not given"
313,"Boland to Dhoni, no run Short outside off, doesn't come on to Dhoni's bat or he simply mistimes it, chops down into the ground, in the direction of cover"

337,"Boland to Dhoni, 1 run full and wide, gets on the front foot to steer it to the right of sweeper cover. They decide, wisely, not to attempt a second as Warner's monster throw comes in"

346,"Faulkner to Pandey, 1 run down the track and he can't get to the pitch of this slower ball outside off. Goes through with the shot, doesn't time it, and it's hanging in the air but agonisingly wide of Bailey diving to his right from extra cover"
347,"Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket, who's right on the edge of the circle, and they run a single. Smith's throw hits Dhoni's bat as he slides home, and he holds up his hands to reassure everyone that he won't run the overthrow"

363,"Marsh to Pandey, 1 run slower short ball outside off, wide of Pandey who's moved across his stumps. Chopped down towards backward point"

367,"Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 run full on middle and leg, clips to midwicket, who's slightly deep and allows a reasonably comfortable single"

373,"Marsh to Dhoni, 1 wide full and wide, and it's given wide after Dhoni leaves it alone. Harsh call, seemed to be just inside the tramline, though, as Wasim Akram reminds us on TV commentary - the line is just an indication"
374,"Marsh to Dhoni, SIX runs bam! That's a low full-toss outside off, in Dhoni's slot, but in this innings he hasn't been middling anything. He doesn't middle this either, but he just about clears the leaping long-off fielder. Warner is the fielder. He would have needed to be as tall as Mohammad Irfan to take that"
375,"Marsh to Pandey, FOUR runs shot. That's full outside off, a wide yorker, almost, and Pandey, cool as a cucumber, brings up his hundred in style. Lets it come on, opens his bat face at impact, and steers it fine to the third man boundary. This has been an outstanding one-day innings"
376,"Marsh to Pandey, 2 runs and it's all over. Full outside off and Pandey launches this over the covers. Doesn't really middle it, but all he needs to do is clear the infield, and that's what he does"
377,"10.12pm This is the first successful 300-plus chase against Australia in Australia. India will feel they should have crossed off that achievement in the previous game itself, but they've done it here, and they've done it with six wickets in hand. Superb innings from Pandey, came in when India had lost a bit of impetus with the quick wickets o"
