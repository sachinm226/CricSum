130,"Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gotten his revenge! Kohli falls to Zampa again! Driven hard, to a ball that was floated around off, and he just couldn't keep it away from Zampa, who takes a sharp chance and then punches the air.

541,"Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gotten his revenge! Kohli falls to Zampa again! Driven hard, to a ball that was floated around off, and he just couldn't keep it away from Zampa, who takes a sharp chance and then punches the air.

549,"Starc to Pant, 1 run length ball at the stumps, flicked towards backward square leg"
550,"Starc to Iyer, OUT and the move to bring Starc back has worked. Don't think it was a special delivery though, a length ball angling away, Iyer pushes away from the body and gets an outside edge, a simple catch for Carey behind the stumps"
551,"Starc to Jadeja, no run goes for the yorker, just outside off. Jadeja jams his bat at it, but the ball hardly goes anywhere. He was looking to run a single but Starc was quick in his followthrough to prevent it"

652,"Kane Richardson to Shami, OUT length ball at the stumps, backs away and looks to smash across, gets a top edge that goes high and behind the stumps, Carey positions himself under it as it comes spiralling down, the ball pops out of his gloves but he does well to cling to the rebound, between his chin/neck and the glove"
653,"Starc to Thakur, 1 run dropped. A full toss at the stumps and lofted towards long-on, not from the middle of the bat. Richardson charges in, a low chance but should have been taken, slips through his fingers"
654,"Starc to Shami, no run Michael Gough gives it lbw. Shami though wants to review it. Has to. A yorker from around the wicket, Shami misses the flick and it hits him right on the shoe. No bat involved but looks like it was going down. Replays show the impact was in the line of the leg stump but the angle would have taken it down. Shami survives"

685,"5.15pm A decent start followed by a middle-overs collapse before a brief rescue act by the lower order. Dhawan top-scored with 74 but India were all out for 255 in 49.1 overs. Starc picked up 3 for 56, and bowled eight yorkers in the game. He has never bowled that many in an ODI, Bharath tells me. Starc reckons the dew may make the ball come easier onto the bat in the second innings. We will be back with the chase"
686,"We're at the start of a new decade, but the ISL remains as dramatic as ever, with mini-brawls, sackings, fiery tweets and of course, a certain player from Bengaluru FC doing what he does best."
687,"5.40pm Back for the chase, not long from now. KL Rahul has the wicketkeeping pads on. That's an interesting update. India will look for quick wickets, and I also think scoring becomes a bit tougher on this pitch once the ball softens a bit. Lots to play for just yet"
688,"No Pant behind the stumps for India, and hence we have KL Rahul filling in as 'keeper. Kohli sets his field for the opening over. Warner will face up to Shami, who starts with two slips"

698,"Bumrah to Finch, 2 runs shorter, and he goes on top of his toes to ride the bounce. Pushes this through the cover-point region, and picks up two before Pandey can pull it back in"

700,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length, a hint of movement back in. Finch wants to press forward to defend, and the inward movement makes the bat skew as he blocks"
701,"Shami to Warner, 1 run strays down the pads, and he can whip it off his legs towards long leg. Wants two, but has to settle for one as the fielder converges quickly from fine leg"
702,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs inswinger, but he stretches and smashes this through covers. Top shot from Finch! A short movement forward with his front foot, and then just going with the shot as he would normally do. It's been a mode of dismissal exploited by India in the past, but not this time"

708,"Bumrah to Finch, no run shorter, a bit of shape back in, and he cuts this towards point"

717,"Shami to Warner, no run length, angles back into him, and he defends this towards cover"

719,"Thakur to Warner, no run gets the very first ball to jag back from around the wicket. Strikes Warner as he misses that. Was it missing leg, or perhaps too high? Eventually, there's no review from India"
720,"Thakur to Warner, no run length, and he presses forward to defend this"
721,"Thakur to Warner, no run fuller ball, a hint of movement back in, and Warner drives this towards point"
722,"Thakur to Warner, 1 wide short, down the leg side, and he chases it, and he's been given out caught behind! Warner reviews after a lengthy chat with Finch. This was a terrible ball actually, and deserved the proper treatment it nearly received from the batsman. Did he just get a feather on it, through to Rahul behind the wicket? No. Nothing on that on the broadcast. Warner stays"
723,"Thakur to Warner, 1 run length, zips in from outside off, and he flicks it with the movement towards fine leg"

731,"Bumrah to Finch, no run fuller, wider, and he plays over the line of this. Looks for the drive, but misses out"
732,"Thakur to Warner, FOUR runs length, but width on offer, and he flogs this inside out. Not off the middle, but good enough to go one and two bounces into the extra cover fence. Off the outside edge too"
733,"Thakur to Warner, no run plays a length ball towards cover"
734,"Thakur to Warner, FOUR runs length, and he looks to go towards mid-wicket. Skews the bat and it goes off towards long leg. A bit of movement back in, nearly defeats him, but not enough"
735,"Thakur to Warner, 1 wide full, but too wide. Left alone"
736,"Thakur to Warner, no run short, and he hops to ride the bounce and defend it"

749,"Thakur to Warner, 1 wide short, but down the leg side. Warner lets this pass"
