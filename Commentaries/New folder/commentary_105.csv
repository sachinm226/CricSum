0,"6.50pm: Australia win the toss and bowl, Warner continues with his 100% record at the toss and exercises the option to chase again. Aaron Finch is fit to return at the top of the order, with Travis Head making way. England have made a couple of changes, with Morgan missing out: Vince is his replacement, while Liam Dawson brings another spin option, Mark Wood the man to make way."
1,"Kane Richardson to Roy, 2 runs back of a length, Roy prods and gets a thick inside edge past his stumps for a couple to fine leg as they come haring back"
2,"Kane Richardson to Roy, 1 wide short, 135kph and veering down the leg side"
3,"Kane Richardson to Roy, no run length, rising to hit the splice as Roy presses on to the front foot"
4,"Kane Richardson to Roy, 1 run banged in short and Roy swivels on a pull to the man at deep square leg"
5,"Kane Richardson to Hales, 3 runs slightly wayward again, dragged down and there's room for Hales to swing his arms at his first ball and clock it through the covers, Warner giving chase to prevent four"
6,"Kane Richardson to Roy, no run dug in, 135kph and climbing through as Roy comes down and bails out of an attempted pull"
7,"Kane Richardson to Roy, 1 wide shortish, big swing and a miss from Roy - too close to the tramlines, though"
8,"Kane Richardson to Roy, FOUR runs back of a length, Roy latches on and cracks the ball through midwicket, beats the man on the ring and it races away for the first boundary of the day"
9,"Stanlake to Hales, no run length outside off, rising up as Hales stabs it towards point"
10,"Stanlake to Hales, OUT Hales smashes the ball into the air, it's high but overs Finch at mid-on... oh, taken at the second attempt on the run! Stanlake strikes second ball thanks to an excellent catch over his shoulder by Finch. Hales, playing his 50th T20I, fails in an attempt to assert himself early"
11,"Stanlake to Roy, 1 run length, 148kph outside off, dabbed to third man on the back foot"
12,"Stanlake to Malan, no run hits the pitch hard, Stanlake pushing the gun up to 148kph again, Malan tries to pull his first ball and splices short of midwicket"
13,"Stanlake to Malan, no run oof, that has ripped through, touching 150kph/93mph and decking away as Malan feels for it and is beaten"
14,"Stanlake to Malan, 1 wide banged in very short, all height and no trousers this time, not troubling the batsman"

16,"Kane Richardson to Malan, 1 run short of a length and tucked off the hip for one"
17,"Kane Richardson to Roy, OUT slightly short, Roy hangs back and tries to guides to third man - but nicks it to the keeper instead! Richardson strikes now, bit of a freebie as Roy got a bit casual rather than going hard, scraped the toe of the bat through to Carey. England two down early"
18,"Kane Richardson to Vince, 1 run pitched up in the channel and Vince strokes one to the cover sweeper to get going"
19,"Kane Richardson to Malan, 1 run short ball, 133kph and swivel-jabbed for one through midwicket"
20,"Kane Richardson to Vince, FOUR runs short and wide and slashed between slip and gully for four! Saw a few of those during the Tests, but there's not so much protection here and Vince picks up a first boundary"
21,"Kane Richardson to Vince, FOUR runs and again, Carey only able to get fingertips on it! This was closer to him as he tried to cut, flew off the top edge but the keeper couldn't quite grab it despite an impressive dive. Slip had gone wider, too"

27,"Stanlake to Malan, OUT tip and run, but there's a direct hit from mid-off! Malan is short! Brilliant work from Warner, collecting low down and releasing a right-arm rocket in one fluid movement - both feet in the air as he lets go - and Malan just keeps on running! He knew he was in trouble but it still required a lightning pick up and release to catch him short of his ground"
28,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, no run shortish and defended coming across"
29,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, no run ooh, beats the outside edge, 133kph and a bit of nibble as Buttler feels for it"
30,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, no run length, tapped downs square"
31,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, 1 run comes across and pats the ball down square, Vince is more assertive this time and calls them through, the underarm from point misses anyway"

40,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run angled in on the stumps and worked away"
41,"Tye to Vince, no run panic at the disco... but Tye drops the ball trying to run out Buttler! Vince's pull picked out midwicket but Buttler had gone racing down,Finch's throw bounced up and Tye looked to have it in his hands but let go just as he was breaking the stumps. Would have been tight, Buttler maybe got his bat back"
42,"Tye to Vince, no run slower ball in the channel, swing and a miss"

68,"Tye to Billings, no run full speed, good length and punched square, terrific bit of fielding from Maxwell at point prevents one"

86,"Stanlake to Billings, OUT gone - slugged into the air and Warner takes it at mid-off! Billings' brief flurry is dealt with, Stanlake is a hard man to hit down the ground often, this was just too quick and his cross-batted mow lobbed up off the top edge"

102,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, OUT pitched up, slogged down the ground... and Agar snags it on the run! Another excellent catch, Australia have been good in the field again, Buttler falls from the last ball looking for a boundary to finish a luke-warm effort. Seemed like he might have got hold of it, a flat, straight hit but taken smartly racing across to his left"
103,"8.50pm Australia will certainly take that. England could never get going and, despite Jos Buttler being out there for more than 15 overs, they fall someway short of 150, which is roughly par for T20s at the MCG. A measure of how he had to play the anchor was that Buttler was the only batsman to score at less than a run a ball - only the second time he has been shackled like that in an innings of 20+ (coincidentally, the other was at the MCG,"
104,David Willey with the first over...he has a slip in place
105,"Willey to Warner, no run good start, short of a length outside off with a hint of swing and Warner is prodding away from his body without any footwork"

107,"Willey to Warner, no run good length at off stump, defended"

115,"Tom Curran to Lynn, 1 run nearly picks out deep square leg! A big full toss, swung high into the leg side and Billings can't quite reach it"
116,"Willey to Lynn, 5 wide round the wicket, gets it wrong, speared full down the leg side, and also evades a diving Buttler"
117,"Willey to Lynn, 1 leg bye this is straighter, fired in at the pads, deflects to the off side"

125,"Jordan to Short, FOUR runs just a hint of width outside off and that's some power from Short, cracks it behind point with a thunderous square drive"
126,"Jordan to Short, 1 run fuller and straighter, at the stumps, tucked into midwicket...certainly no run rate pressure for Australia"
127,"Jordan to Lynn, no run a short ball, 141kph, Lynn goes for the pull and it scoots over the top edge"
128,"Jordan to Lynn, 1 run double-bluff, field set for the short ball and he pulls out a yorker, outside leg stump, than Lynn jabs out by his feet"

137,"Jordan to Lynn, no run responds with the slower ball, Lynn is through his shot and gets an inside edge into his pads"
138,"Jordan to Short, no run a slower ball at the pads, brings an appeal lbw, surely pitched outside leg...they opt against the review"
