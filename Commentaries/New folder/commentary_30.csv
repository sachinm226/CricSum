258,"Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run bit of hesitation, and had Richardson stopped the ball, a run-out was on."
259,"Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run takes the pace off the ball. We might see more of that given how flat this wicket looks right now"

261,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run runs it down to midwicket"

264,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run wicket-to-wicket, blocked"

459,"Agar to Kohli, 2 runs dinked into the onside, and the lack of pace means the two can come back for a couple. Excellent batting by India. They appear to be scoring big runs without taking risks"
460,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run slower ball. No pace to work it, but Rahul smears it down to the sweeper for one"
461,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run takes the pace off again. Cross-batted down the ground"
462,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, no run nearly dragged it onto his stumps. Cannoned into his pads and Rahul frantically searched around for the ball to ensure it didn't trickle onto his stumps"
463,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 2 runs thumped over cover. No timing once more, but plenty of muscle on it"
464,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run sweetly timed to midwicket. Fielder does well to keep it to one"
465,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run slower ball, nudged into the offside. Good over from Australia at this stage"
466,"Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again! What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself"
467,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run paddled away to the leg side"
468,"Zampa to Pandey, no run brave enough to give it more flight now. Defended to the covers"
469,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 run driven to long-off"
470,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run chipped to deep midwicket"
471,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 run this one darted through. Thick inside edge and he keeps the strike"
472,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs slower ball again. Jadeja works it away to the onside, and absolutely races back for two. He might have been running quicker than Richardson's bowling right now"
473,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run smashes it down the ground, runs well clear of the pitch this time"
474,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run tonked down to cow corner. Rahul is timing the ball so sweetly right now"

476,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run runs it down to backward point"
477,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs clever running once more. Chipped into the vacant space on the legside and Jadeja hares back for two more. 8 off that over"
478,"Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs backfoot punch, gorgeous shot again. What can you do about that? Bowling at 145, but Rahul still slices it away past third man for four"
479,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run run down to third man"
480,"Starc to Jadeja, 2 runs full, reverse swinging yorker, but Jadeja smears it down to the onside and scampers back once more"
481,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 wide dragged down. Big wide. So big KL Rahul toyed with the idea of coming through for a bye"

483,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run helped down to the fine leg fielder"
484,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run full toss on leg stump. Very, very fortunate Jadeja's sent this right down to fine leg. That had four written all over it"
485,"Kane Richardson to Pandey, OUT top edged from Pandey, no timing on it and Agar completes a much easier catch this time. Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat"
486,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run ungainly hoick that's nowhere near the middle. Jadeja on strike"
487,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, FOUR runs four first delivery. You couldn't ask for a better one to be eased in. Down legside at pace, and all he needed to do was get a feather on it and watch it race away"
488,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, no run guided to backward point. Thinks about a run, thinks again"
489,"Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run carved to sweeper cover"
490,"Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run smart running. Just timed to mid-off and he's on his way"
491,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run crunched to cover-point. Beautiful timing on it"
492,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run short delivery, looking to pepper Jadeja, I suspect. He gets off strike"
493,"Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs low full toss"
494,"Starc to Rahul, SIX runs is that the shot of the day? I'd venture to say so. Starc at full tilt, and he's lifted him over extra cover for six as if he was Chris Harris on sedatives. Rahul has so much time right now"
495,"Starc to Rahul, 1 wide dragged down. This is a costly over, and 300 is up for India"
496,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run short ball, helped away to the leg side"
497,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run sensibly keeps it short once more. But expensive over. Australia would have been counting on Starc, and his next two overs may be crucial to the game's outcome"
498,"Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run slower short delivery. Struck to extra cover. They still scamper through"
499,"Cummins to Rahul, 2 runs slower bouncer. Rahul turns his bat into a periscope and sort of tennis-smashes it to midwicket. Sharp running by the duo again, they have been superb"
500,"Cummins to Rahul, no run full pace, shorter delivery. Rahul swings, but for once, doesn't connect"
501,"Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs Cummins has tried to be too clever by half. This short ball Rahul was lying in wait for. Just opened the face of the bat and helped it away over third man all the way for six. Incredible shot."
502,"Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs attempted yorker, but Rahul moved back in his crease, and flicked it to fine leg for four. A diving Labuschagne can't prevent it"

504,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run no timing from the batsman. Went straight up but into a gap."
505,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run pull shot gets Rahul back on strike. He's on 80 with 4 balls to go. Any chance of a 100?"
506,"Starc to Rahul, 1 bye misses it completely. Slower ball and a wild hoick that goes through to the keeper. They run a bye Australia aren't too concerned with preventing"
507,"Starc to Jadeja, OUT and that's Rahul gone. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit"
508,"Starc to Shami, 1 run yorker. Shami does well to get enough bat on it to get Jadeja on strike"
509,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run smashed straight to the cover fielder, and they run one. That gets India to 340."
510,Scorers at the ground have clarified that five penalty runs were not awarded for running on the pitch.
511,"Meanwhile, India and Australia will also come face-to-face at the men's hockey Pro League this season. A big tournament, it assumes added significance this year because of the Tokyo Olympics in July-August. India begin with two home matches against the Netherlands this weekend. Here are four"
512,5:10 pm A magnificent last 10 overs have got them slightly above what they'd have looked at around the 30-over mark. Can Australia make a fist of this? Join Peter in about 40 minutes to find out

524,"Shami to Warner, 3 runs short of a length outside off, short arm jab pull over wide mid-on, didn't complete the flourish and it is tracked down by Saini short of the rope. Saini is now clutching his left ankle. He's down for a minute but gets back up now. He's come off for a sub."
525,"Shami to Finch, no run short on the stumps, defended into the off side."

534,"Shami to Warner, OUT Pandey! The Barracuda! Length ball angled across fifth stump, Warner spanks this flat toward cover, didn't look like he wanted to keep it down but didn't get the elevation either. Pandey on the ring times his leap perfectly to intercept it with his right hand reach"

549,"Shami to Smith, no run huge lbw shout! This looked very close with Smith shuffling across defending down the wrong line. Given not out. Kohli opts against the review. Was touch and go whether he was hit in line with the stumps, replays show he was hit just outside off"

604,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run helped to the onside"
605,"Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs another wrong-un, Smith lobs this into the air with the turn. The in-fielder on the offside thought he was in with a chance but it's well out of his grasp. Eight off that over"
606,"Jadeja to Finch, OUT have they got their man? Yes, they have! Finch opened his body up to smash it over extra cover, but was beaten by the turn. Excellent glovework by KL Rahul, who whips the bails off while Finch's foot is on the line. Incredibly tight call, but I think giving it out"

630,"Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run opens the face of the blade and eases it to third man. The pace is back because these two looked so settled against spin"

687,"Jadeja to Smith, no run stone dead! Has to be! Given not out! Kohli calls for the review. Smith did his traditional back and across but missed in front of middle stump halfway up just above the knee roll but very deep in his crease. DRS ball-tracking shows... Umpire's call clipping th"

698,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run dances down the track and gets off strike"
699,"Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs no timing, that was uppish, just out of Jadeja's reach. It goes all the way for four, though, and you can hear a pin drop"
700,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run better ball, pushes Smith back, but he manages to work it away for a run"
701,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT and that's the wicket! Rajkot erupts! He is furious with himself! Came down the track but seemed caught in two minds as regards to whether he should chip it or look to clear the mid-off fielder. Ends up as the most comfortable catch for Mohammad Shami. Huge,"
702,"Jadeja to Carey, no run defends first up. Big, big over for India"
703,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run helps it down to fine leg. Smith looking to carry on as if nothing has happened"
704,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run Reverse sweeps Kuldeep first up. Lacked conviction, though, and it produces no runs"

718,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run wrong'un. Carey had no idea about it, nearly found himself trapped plumb in front"
719,"Kuldeep to Carey, SIX runs that's what Carey should be doing more. Gets down low and smears it over cow corner. Not middled, but it still comfortably sails over the rope and into the stands"
720,"Kuldeep to Carey, 3 runs beats the man in the in-field, but decent work from Saini on the boundary prevents the four"

728,"Kuldeep to Smith, no run defended"
729,"Kuldeep to Smith, no run big, big appeal as Smith tried to smear Kuldeep onto the onside. Never looked out, though"

747,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run nicely timed down the ground"
748,"Bumrah to Turner, 4 leg byes legbyes for four. Much, much needed for Australia. Slightly misdirected from Bumrah for once, and it beats the man at fine leg"
749,"Bumrah to Turner, 1 run sharp running. Turner keeps the strike as the asking rate moves above 10"
750,"Shami to Turner, 2 runs muscled away to the on-side for a couple. Turner needs to have a go soon."
