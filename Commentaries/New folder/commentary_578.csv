0,1.25pm Phenomenal atmosphere as Gilchrist comes in to bat for the last time at his home patch after Ponting won the toss and batted.

5,"Vaas to Hayden, no run tight line once more, on off, a good length, and it's defended strongly on the front foot"
6,"Vaas to Hayden, no run good length again, pitching just outside off and some delicious shape away - but the batsman's not moved, letting the ball through"
7,"Malinga to Gilchrist, FOUR runs too wide outside off, no footwork there as Gilchrist drives hard through the covers - that was pure timing"
8,"Malinga to Gilchrist, no run straight ball, at 145kph, up there and defended from outside off with a sturdy shot"
9,"Malinga to Gilchrist, no run swivelled right onto the dot by Malinga, the batsman moving into the line on off and defends right behind the ball on the back foot"

17,"Vaas to Hayden, 2 runs overpitched on leg, and you can't bowl there to him, the batsman quick to bring his hands down on to the ball, clunking it out to midwicket and they come back for two"
18,"Vaas to Hayden, no run not a moment for Hayden to treasure, coming out, looking to drive through extra and stops on the shot, an action which scoops the ball up invitingly but without too much alarm"

25,"Vaas to Gilchrist, no run short on off again and played back down"

229,"Murali to Gilchrist, 1 run straight, full, and worked out in front of midwicket this time"
230,"Murali to Hussey, no run floated past him, the batsman coming out to meet it, Sangakkara gets the bails off but has he done so in time? The third umpire reckons he has, Hussey's back foot somehow straight back down"

239,"Murali to Hussey, 1 run worked out forward for a quick single"
240,"Murali to Gilchrist, 1 run dropped by Kapugedera coming in off the rope at deep midwicket, he was a bit lazy coming in and drops it on the crouch"
241,"Murali to Hussey, no run defended forward"
242,"Murali to Hussey, no run Hussey tries to reverse sweep, then turns hockey player as he tries to dribble it back round"

244,"Malinga to Hussey, 1 run opens the face to guide the ball down to third man to bring Gilchrist back on strike"
245,"Malinga to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist is finally gone, trying to loft one over long-off and took a leading edge to the covers, Kapugedera holding on this time over his head, having dropped him last over"
246,"Malinga to Hussey, 1 wide left alone outside off, a wide veers wider"
247,"Malinga to Hussey, no run pushed through down the channel"

250,"Malinga to Hopes, no run comes forward, squares up and the ball takes an outside edge but safe"

252,"Maharoof to Hussey, 2 runs down the track, a mistimed pull again from him"
253,"Maharoof to Hussey, 3 runs worked well for two through square and they collect an overthrow too, Jayasuriya has something to say about it, the bowler was nowhere near behind the stumps"

257,"Maharoof to Hopes, 1 run goes for a huge aerial drive which isn't properly timed and so falls short of wide mid-on"
258,"Kulasekara to Hopes, OUT lifted from a short one outside off high and higher - the ball catching the toe end - and goes on over towards Jayasuriya who clings on, making no mistake"

286,"Malinga to Lee, no run good ball to greet Lee, short and sharp and Lee does well to sway back from it"
287,"Malinga to Lee, no run short and bounces up off the glove, landing safe"
288,"Kulasekara to Hussey, OUT Hussey looks to hit across the line rather than straight and his would-be pull goes up instead to the covers where Jayawardene sets himself to take a straightforward catch"
289,"Kulasekara to Lee, no run outside off, horrible shot really, no footwork from Lee who swings and misses away from his body, aiming for the topspin lob"

296,"Malinga to Bracken, 1 bye follows him down leg, swing and miss from more backing away, they take the bye which is naughty and Sangakkara's huge underarm loop one-two with Malinga nearly results in the run-out at the non-striker's"
297,"Malinga to Lee, OUT cleaned up with another excellent yorker to finish the tail off well, Lee backing away, and Malinga firing in on leg stump"
298,"Great comeback job from Sri Lanka's bowlers there, Malinga ends with four well-deserved wickets. Good fielding throughout on the whole, with the exception of a few drops. Gilchrist did really well in his final ODI at the WACA with a well-worked hundred, replete with plenty of singles."
299,"We're back with the run-chase. Sri Lanka did really well to pick up wickets in the end, keeping Australia down to less than five an over. A good start here and they may be on their way to a special win. The pitch has been bouncy, though, and the new-ball bowlers wouldn't want to let t"
300,"Lee to Dilshan, FOUR runs What a start! full and on the pads, Dilshan cutely flicks it over backward square leg for a four, superb innovation at the top of the order"
301,"Lee to Dilshan, no run short of a length and straight this time, Dilshan on the back foot and defending down the ground"
302,"Lee to Dilshan, 5 leg byes runs flowing freely here, they take a quick leg-bye to Haddin but a direct hit deflects off the stumps and runs away down the ground for four. Too easy first up."
303,"Lee to Jayasuriya, FOUR runs spanked with the force of a marauder, short and wide from Lee and Jayasuriya upper-cuts it for four, a silence descends over the WACA, Sri Lanka on a roll"
304,"Lee to Jayasuriya, 3 runs wide again and Jayasuriya whacks it over the covers again, what a flood first up, lobs onto the outfield and they get three"
305,"Lee to Dilshan, no run short and slightly wide, 147kph, left alone, what an opening over for Sri Lanka, 16 off it."

312,"Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 run full and on off, Jayasuriya pushes to mid-off and races for a single"
313,"Lee to Dilshan, FOUR runs what a blitzer, full and on off, Dilshan smokes it off the front foot, super cover-drive for four and the WACA is too stunned here. Sri Lanka galloping away"
314,"Lee to Dilshan, no run short and pacy, 145kph, Dilshan goes for the pull shot but doesn't read the length well, deflects off the pads to the slip cordon"
315,"Lee to Dilshan, no run on the middle stump, batsman tries to force it to the leg side but he's cramped for room, sees the ball drop close to him"
316,"Lee to Dilshan, (no ball) short one from Lee, but that's a no-ball, Dilshan lets it go but sees the umpire signals a free-hit. Time to throw caution to the wind"
317,"Lee to Dilshan, 2 runs another short one, and a pull this time, ferociously latches on to it, can't time it well and picks up a couple to fine leg"
318,"Lee to Dilshan, no run short of a length, punched off the back foot"
319,"Bracken to Jayasuriya, OUT he's thrown it away, Jayasuriya charges down the track and tries to smack Bracken over extra-cover, can only get a thick outside edge, though, and pops a simple catch to third man. The fielder there is alert and nabs one of the most important wickets."
320,"Bracken to Dilshan, 1 run full and angled away towards the covers, brilliant stop by Symonds (who else?) and Hussey picks it up in a flash and tries to throw towards the non-striker's end, Dilshan would have had to go if that was a direct hit"

325,"Johnson to Dilshan, 1 wide rusty start there, big wide outside off from Johnson, he's bowling against the wind so he will need to get used to that"
326,"Johnson to Dilshan, no run full and tapped to cover, the crowd thinks it's a catch but that was actually a bump ball, Symonds fumbles initially and gets in a direct hit, no point running on a misfield to him"
327,"Johnson to Dilshan, OUT castled! 142kph from Johnson and that's a yorker length ball that swings in late, Dilshan goes for the expansive drive but is beaten all ends up, through the gate, door and kitchen onto the middle and off stump. That sound of ball hitting stumps (tling) i"

333,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs super shot, Lee digs it in slightly short but Jayawardene is upto the challenge, flicking his wrists and lifting over the slips for four, the third man is a bit too wide and he can't get to it. Good use of Lee's pace from Mahela that time"

337,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run defended down the ground, not much pace off the pitch, looks like a good one for batting"
338,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run full and on middle stump, Sangakkara walks across and whips it towards square leg. No single, though"
339,"Johnson to Sangakkara, 3 runs full and on middle stump again, Sangakkara is too wristy a player to miss out, smacks it towards midwicket for three"
340,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run loose drive outside off, that ball was bowled to induce that shot, Mahela not moving his feet there"
341,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run left alone, short of a good length ball outside off"
342,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run straight and accurate, pushed off the back foot back to the bowler"
343,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs dropped, by Ponting at second slip, Jayawardene flashes loosely, not much feet movement there and gets a healthy edge that flies towards second slip, Ponting lunges towards it but can only parry it away (goal-keeper style) to the third ma"

345,"Lee to Sangakkara, 3 runs full and on middle, clipped away towards midwicket for three, super shot again"
346,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run full and on middle and leg, fast one there, Lee is confident of the lbw appeal but the umpire is not convinced, Jayawardene indicates that he might have got an inside edge to that one, that looked close"
347,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs lazy and elegant and sensational, few batsmen drive better than this man and he's creamed Lee towards the covers for four"

364,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs outside off, dragged short and with plenty of room for him to latch onto a thunderous drive that races over the turf backward of point"
365,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs pushed across him once more, a touch of room and some width, again he goes square with a drive just in front of point now"
366,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT but he's gone now, just as he was getting set, the ball pushed across him making him play, hint of movement off the seam and with some late swing once he was committed to the shot, taking a step and thick-edging to second slip where Ponting ma"

368,"Bracken to Sangakkara, no run tight, ever so tight on off, forcing the front-foot defensive to a decent-length ball"
369,"Bracken to Sangakkara, no run left armer to left hander, pushed down straight outside off, Sangakkara waits and defends on the front foot"
370,"Bracken to Sangakkara, 5 runs nipped back fro outside off, pushed to mid-on and they get the single, Hogg has a go at the non-striker's end, it wouldn't have been out and the ball runs on for four overthrows"
371,"Bracken to Silva, no run defended on the front foot"
372,"Bracken to Silva, no run through him as he stabds a forward defensive and there's a cry from a noise as the bat hit the pad, certainly not the ball which leapt over the shoulder"

374,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run outside off, Sangakkara comes forward and almost yorks himself outside the line to defend"

376,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run down the channel again, more swing, the batsman is quick to shoulder arms and hold his bat high for a while making sure the ball has gone through. It had and then some"
