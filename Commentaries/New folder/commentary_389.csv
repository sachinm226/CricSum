54,"Chanderpaul the star with another hundred but this total was far from all him, there were very important contributions throughout the order. And Brathwaite, Edwards and Bravo will be disappointed they didn't take their excellent starts on to bigger numbers. Still a good effort and the Test set up well now for the hosts, they'd certainly do well to lose from here...the Australian innings in five minutes time..."
55,"And there is the declaration...so the Windies call it quits with a fine total on the board, it's taken a while but they have a very good total now with which to apply pressure in this mini session they will now have at the Australian top order."
56,"50 runs really isn't much to Australia, they need time to try and bowl the Windies out...but I suppose nine down the innings might end quickly anyway...change in the bowling and Fidel Edwards, can he wrap things up..."
57,"Edwards to Harris, no run catches Harris on the pad and given out! Harris goes upstairs... may as well...it might be a touch high perhaps, I don't think he's hit it, caught above the knee roll on the crease...it is high. Going over the top says Hawk Eye so Harris survives on review and the Aussie innings goes on"

59,"Edwards to Harris, no run length outside off and blocked into the off side"

70,"Edwards to Lyon, no run leg side, strikes the pad and well saved by Baugh tumbling to his left"
71,"Edwards to Lyon, 5 wide but there's no saving this, a short ball way way down leg and it's called as five wides"

82,"Edwards to Harris, 1 leg bye late in swing for Sammy, appeal for lbw, pitched outside off, hits the back leg in front, given not out. That's okay, but there was hardly any appeal at all. This ball is shown to be clipping leg by technology"
83,"Edwards to Lyon, 1 leg bye reversing into the pads again, keeps it out"
84,"Edwards to Harris, no run reversing towards off, Harris is solid and behind it, driving it to mid-on"
85,"Edwards to Harris, no run full, just outside off, tailing in, driven back to Edwards"
86,"Edwards to Harris, no run this one holds its line outside off, but matters little to Harris who drives it towards mid-off"

88,Innings Start
89,Even I keep glancing at the clock...the light seems to be holding at the moment after looking dodgy a while ago but it's disappearing behind that stand...
