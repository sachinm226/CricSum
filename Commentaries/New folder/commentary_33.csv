0,"12.30pm: South Africa win the toss and bat, they've included Janneman Malan and Kyle Verreynne for ODI debuts. Temba Bavuma is also fit to return, back in the No. 3 berth. Australia, meanwhile, have gone for something of a change-up in the middle order, with D'Arcy Short included as the spinning allrounder at No.7. That means no Ashton Agar, while Josh Hazlewood completes a Test-quali"
1,"Starc to Malan, OUT full and swinging, 143kph/89mph, did that hit him on the boot?? Nigel Llong immediately turned away from the appeal, but Finch reviews, and this could be a sensational start for Australia! Definitely hit the bat, but it looks as if it crashed into the toe first - and this is stone dead, if so. Yes, boot first, that's plumb, golden duck for Malan on debut! Sma"
2,"Starc to Bavuma, no run length ball, jumps a touch to hit Bavuma on the thigh pad, around leg stump"
3,"Starc to Bavuma, 1 run fullish and shaping back, flicked through backward square leg for the first SA run"

8,"Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run shaping away this time, not there for the drive and Bavuma leaves it be"
9,"Hazlewood to Bavuma, FOUR runs touch full, 134kph/83mph and skelped through extra cover once more! Not a half-volley, by any means, and some swing, too, but it shaped right into the meat of Temba's bat as he stepped out to drive"

33,"Cummins to Bavuma, no run fullish, comes across and punches to mid-off"

51,"Hazlewood to Bavuma, 2 runs dropped! Shanked over the on side, should be a simple take for Starc running back at mid-on, but he shells it! Coming over his shoulder but he was in position, got both hands to it, only to bar-of-soap it and give Temba a life!"

56,"Hazlewood to Verreynne, no run back of a length outside off, Verreynne taps the ball down"
57,"Cummins to Bavuma, OUT dragged on! Cummins strikes and this is already looking sticky for South Africa... Bavuma had been playing nicely but he's misjudged the bounce, maybe too close for the cut shot, too, and he cannons a thick bottom edge into his timbers. Off stump flat on its back, SA wobbling!"

82,"Short to Verreynne, 1 run on the stumps, Verreynne stays in the crease and clips with the spin"
83,"Short to Klaasen, no run flighted, skidding into the pads as Klaasen sweeps... Short liked it, but I thought it pitched outside leg. Finch, after some discussion, elects to review. Was that a googly? No, apparently the legbreak, and Hawk-Eye has it pitching just outside - umpire's call - and then spinning sharply past the wicket. So not a good review"

240,"Zampa to Miller, 4 leg byes tossed, outside leg stump and Miller sweeps, did he get bat on it? Zampa was appealing for lbw, but that was optimistic. Runs very fine and Cummins can't cut it off, goes down as leg byes, though"

255,"Short to Miller, no run dragged down and Miller rasps a cut in front of square, brilliantly cut off by the diving Smith at extra cover. Superb work"
256,"Short to Miller, 3 runs whipped leg sided, they push hard for two... and a misfield allows them to come back for a third, raising the 100 stand between this pair!"

258,"Short to Miller, 1 run shortish from Short, spinning away and cut off the back foot"

261,"Starc to Miller, 1 run full length and punched into the covers coming across"
262,"Starc to Klaasen, SIX runs short ball, top-edged on the pull... flies all the way to the unguarded fence at fine leg! Probably a good thing he didn't get it where he was aiming, as deep backward square would have been in the game"

270,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run slower-ball bouncer from Cummins, Miller is forward and then has time to think about four different shots before shovelling through midwicket for one - that's fifty for Miller, at almost a run a ball. Vital knock for his side"

272,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run tries to come down and swipes aggressively through the line to long-on"

275,"Starc to Klaasen, 1 run full and tailing away wide of the stumps, 142kph/88mph and squirted down to third man... on to 99 now, but Klaasen will want that all-important flake"

279,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run pitched up, slower ball on off stump and stroked down the ground"
280,"Cummins to Klaasen, 1 run shortish outside off, Klaasen clips through square leg and immediately clenches his fist... Maiden ODI hundred for Heinrich Klaasen, off comes the helmet as he celebrates with his team-mate. He's red as a beet, it's been hot, hard work, but he's dug SA out of trouble with a fine knock"
281,"Cummins to Miller, no run short ball, pace off and Miller swings hard, fails to connect"
282,"Cummins to Miller, no run length, another cutter going away from Miller, who swipes and misses again"
283,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run full ball, pace on, 139kph/87mph and Miller chops an inside edge past his stumps"
284,"Cummins to Klaasen, SIX runs smeared down the ground! Klaasen nails Cummins at last, creaming a baseball blow over long-on, picked the offcutter and got plenty of bat on it. SA still brawling"

290,"Hazlewood to Miller, 1 run on the stumps and whipped into a gap leg side - again just the one boundary off the over"
291,"Cummins to Miller, FOUR runs Miller time! At last... Picks the slower ball, smokes it down the ground! Just bounces in front of the rope, a good start to the over for SA"
292,"Cummins to Miller, OUT short ball, follows the batsman as he goes across... flapped to the keeper! Miller looking to get cute with the ramp but ends up inside-edging a simple catch to Carey! Been a bit of a struggle at the death, but still an important innings after the strife SA were in"
293,"Cummins to Phehlukwayo, no run short of a length, another offcutter and Lucky is bamboozled, dangling his bat out but can't connect"
294,"Cummins to Phehlukwayo, OUT moves across, exposing all three stumps... jabbed into the leg side and Klaasen wants on, Phehlukwayo is going to be short here! Brilliant from Cummins, fielding in his follow-through to his left, turning and throwing down the stumps with the batsman nowhere!"
295,"Cummins to Klaasen, 2 runs punched through the off side, they'll come back for two"

300,"Starc to Maharaj, OUT timber! Torpedoes off stump! Outta the ground and Maharaj is outta there... Having struck with his first ball, Starc has to wait until his 57th to pick up a second wicket with a classic yorker"
301,"Starc to Nortje, 1 run full outside off, sliced towards backward point and they scamper through"
302,"Starc to Klaasen, 2 runs full and straight and he miscues a slog, straight up over the keeper... but Carey can't get there running back! Bit of luck for Klaasen, but he's earned that today"
303,"Starc to Klaasen, 2 runs short of a length, slower ball to finish and pulled down the ground... Anrich Nortje will scramble back to the danger end for a second, Klaasen completing a very respectable salvage job for SA"
304,"A cracking effort from Klaasen, who more than doubled his previous ODI best of 59. That total is certainly much more competitive than looked likely when SA were 48 for 3, with Klaasen and the debutant Kyle Verreynne in the middle. But that partnership helped light the way, before a stand of 149 from Klaasen and Miller gave them plenty to bowl at. Australia have some firepower of their"

329,"Ngidi to Finch, OUT no foot movement, flashes at it outside off stump, and feathers an edge behind! Finch departs early, throwing his hands at a back-of-a-length ball in the channel. Bit of extra bounce perhaps, struck the top edge as he look to flay a cross-batted shot through cover point, and the gleeful de Kock takes the catch!"
330,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run cutter outside off, Smith shuffles across and works into midwicket via the inside half of the bat"
331,"Ngidi to Warner, FOUR runs outswinger on a length, thick edge from Warner looking to steer through point and it flies away for four! The man from slip had moved into the covers, and it races away to the fence"

355,"Ngidi to Smith, no run hard length outside off, pressed to short cover on the bounce"
356,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run Smith shuffles across, nudging to mid-on and setting off immediately for a scurried single. Puts the fielder, Malan, under pressure, and he can't gather cleanly"
357,"Ngidi to Warner, OUT chipped to the man in the covers, who takes a low catch and celebrates! Warner isn't going anywhere in a hurry... we're going upstairs, but the soft signal is out, which is so often important. Verreynne is the catcher... looks like he's jammed his fingers underneath the ball to me. These things always look worse in slow-motion. We're onto our second angle, w"

369,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, no run cutter, sliding down the leg side, clips him on the pad as he shuffles across. Phehlukwayo lets out an ambitious, vociferous appeal, but that's surely very unlikely... hang on, de Kock reviews!
