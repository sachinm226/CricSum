228,"Johnson to Iftikhar, 1 run on the pads, turned away for a single"
229,"Johnson to Fawad Alam, 1 run slower ball, played in front of his body, manages to get it wide enough of Johnson"
230,"Johnson to Iftikhar, no run another one takes it in the helmet - Rao, after Malik and Sarfraz - this is a sharp bouncer, Rao gets in line to fend, but realises it has got big, and takes his eye off and presents it the helmet"
231,"Johnson to Iftikhar, no run backs a way a touch, Johnson bowls full and wide, Rao misses"
232,"Harris to Fawad Alam, no run takes off from foot marks, it's full and straight, and Haddin does well to recover and collect it head high"
233,"Harris to Fawad Alam, FOUR runs good shot, straight over mid-off, backs away, gets under a length delivery, and hits it smack over mid-off, 200 up - didn't look likely after the first 13 overs"
234,"Harris to Fawad Alam, no run short and sharp, hurries him up into the pull shot, beats him"
235,"Harris to Fawad Alam, 1 run length ball, crashed down the ground, gets a single"

239,"McKay to Iftikhar, OUT Ponting picks this one late, and then virtually flies across to hold onto this one. McKay goes fast and follows a backing-away Rao, and gets out a limp shot, lobbed towards midwicket where Ponting does the rest"
240,"McKay to Fawad Alam, OUT Yes he can! Alam gets too much under this length delivery and can't clear mid-on"
241,"1610hrs From 2 for 0, and 3 for 16, Pakistan have done well to reach 212, thanks again to Umar Akmal and Fawad Alam, and Shoaib Malik. Will this be enough to prevent a whitewash? Seems unlikely, but the pitch is cracking up, so can't completely count Pakistan out. Join us for the chase in half an"
242,"Three overs each left for Rana and Rao, will they prove to be the weak link for Pakistan, or will they stand up here and surprise Australia? Rana to bowl - 37 off 36. Mid-on and mid-off up"

244,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run length ball, pushed across Hussey, he gets a thick edge towards third man"
245,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Johnson, OUT and what a time for Rana to strike, loose shot really, shortish, angled across him, Johnson cuts without getting close to it, the edge is snapped by Sarfraz, and Pakistan are in a huddle, they can feel it, they can sense a win around the corner"
246,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run good delivery first up, back of a length, around off, defended off the back foot"
247,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run nice inswinging yorker, that's the delivery that pays most of his bills, Hauritz can't do much with that"

251,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, FOUR runs Rao bowls short and wide, and Hauritz has cut it absolutely smack off the middle of the bat, wide of cover-point, what a shot for a No. 9 to be playing in this situation"
252,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run slower ball, early into the shot, uppishly hit, but wide of Rao, mid-off keeps them in their creases"

254,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 wide slower bouncer goes wrong, down the leg side"

258,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run Hussey steps down again, doesn't get any room, Hussey drops and runs, Butt at short third misses again, Hauritz was a goner had he hit"
259,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run superb delivery, back of a length, bounces extra, holds its line, beats him"
260,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, FOUR runs smart shot, third man is square, and he deliberately opens the face on a length delivery, all along the ground it goes, and bisects the slip and the third man"
261,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run slower ball, too straight, helped away to short fine for a single"
262,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 run fulltoss, yorker goes wrong, hit down to mid-off for a single"

264,"Iftikhar to Hussey, 1 run full, on off, pushed down the ground to long-off, gets a single"
265,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run Hauritz back away, Rao follows him with a short delivery, cramps him, Hauritz has to get the glove in the way to protect his ribs, priceless dot"
266,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, 2 runs inswinging yorker, digs it out, Hussey is always going for two as it limps towards long-on, and comes back easily, helped by a wide throw from Alam"
267,"Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 run slower short delivery, gets on top of it, runs it down to third man"
268,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 2 runs Pakistan could have done without the overthrow, Alam - who has been fantastic in the field today - shies from backward point but Hauritz has made it, and there is nobody backing up either"
269,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run full, gets a single to midwicket, helped by a fumble by Butt"

273,"Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, FOUR runs he can't, he just drops it short. And he hates being called Mr Cricket, that's what he has been tonight, gets under the short delivery, pulls it between fine leg and deep square leg, and pumps his fist"
274,"Iftikhar to Harris, 2 runs Harris can't do no wrong, don't shake his hand if you are in Perth, you might just turn to gold. He just saw a length ball, and swiped it over midwicket, gets two, scores level"
275,"Iftikhar to Harris, (no ball) it's a beamer, what drama, surely yorker gone wrong, lobs straight to mid-off, Afridi catches and appeals, but Asoka calls it a no-ball, just above waist, so fair call. Just wondering if the modern fashion of wearing trousers low would help getting such call"
276,"Adam Gilchrist hands over the winners' trophy to Ricky Ponting and delighted Australia team. Time for me, Sidharth Monga, to say good bye."
277,"What a match we have had, the best of the lot in this series. One of the best ODIs of late, just goes on to prove what fun a low-scoring close ODI can be. Better than a 414 v 411 for me. And as usual Hussey saw Australia home here, despite Pakistan putting up their best 50 overs of the series in"
