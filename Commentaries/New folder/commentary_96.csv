8,"Tye to Roy, OUT battered high in the air, and Hazlewood circles at mid-on to gather a steepling miscue! The knuckleball does the trick, Roy was deceived by the change of pace, was through his shot too soon, and an aggressive if at times streaky innings comes to an end"

46,"Starc to Bairstow, SIX runs short ball, 145kph/90mph... and helped on it's way over the third man boundary! Bit of a wafty uppercut, Zampa was down there but never in the game"
47,"Starc to Bairstow, no run rapped on the pads, there's a shout for lbw - but Smith indicates it was maybe high and they don't review"

54,"Starc to Bairstow, OUT bowled 'im, YJB deflects the ball on to his stumps! Starc makes the breakthrough, pace and zip off the pitch and Bairstow prodded with a wonky bat, trying to run it behind point but only getting an inside edge on to leg stump"

65,"Maxwell to Hales, no run prodded back to the bowler"
66,"Starc to Root, 3 runs slightly full on the pads, swinging in as Root flicks across the line and sends the ball racing away into the vacant green acres - though we might get another all-run four there, but Root slipped slightly coming back for the third"
67,"Starc to Hales, 1 run drops short, Hales opens the shoulders and carves the ball square, Maxwell does well to get fingertips on it to keep them to one"
68,"Starc to Root, no run rising off a length, 139kph/87mph and pushed into the covers"

95,"Zampa to Hales, 1 run pushed through outside off and cut for a single to the sweeper"
96,"Marsh to Hales, OUT short ball, Hales tries to wallop it over square leg... but skews a top edge to point!

120,"Marsh to Buttler, 1 leg bye Buttler tries to come down, another short ball and it ricochets off his shoulder behind square on the off side"

133,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run slashed out through the covers, quite high on the splice and in the air for a while"
134,"Tye to Root, no run climbing into the pull and thumped under the ribcage! Ouch, that's going to hurt. No dissimilar to Pietersen's cracked rib against McGrath in the 2006-07 tour. Hopefully no lasting damage on this occasion"
135,"Tye to Root, 1 wide off line"
136,"Tye to Root, 1 run dabbed into the off side and through they jog. Root can rest up at the non-striker's end for a moment"

138,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run tapped into the off side, Root was slow getting going, and Maxwell's shy slides past the stumps! A direct hit would have been very, very tight"

147,"Tye to Root, no run tapped to cover, riding the extra bounce"

149,"Tye to Root, 1 run swinging into the toes, and tucked behind square. A bread-and-butter single"
150,"Tye to Buttler, OUT full, and Buttler holes out to mid-off! That's a critical breakthrough for Australia, Warner back-pedals to complete the catch, and once again, Tye's slower ball draws out the miscue from a well-set batsman"

167,"Zampa to Root, no run onto the front foot, meeting the fuller length, and steered into the covers"
168,"Zampa to Root, 2 runs delicate flick over the shoulder from Root, reversing the hands to ramp-sweep the ball. Gathered with a slide by the chasing gully"

179,"Zampa to Root, 1 run hauled out through square leg"
180,"Zampa to Ali, OUT that's a very soft dismissal from Moeen! Down the track, losing his shape, a wellied drive in the air to cover, and England's hopes of their habitual 300-plus total are looking bleak all of a sudden"

197,"Hazlewood to Rashid, 1 run pounded out to deep point"
198,"Hazlewood to Root, FOUR runs short and wide, slapped high and hard, and just eludes third man! The ball ricochets off the spreadeagled fielder and over the rope, and that is Root's fifty as well."

200,"Hazlewood to Rashid, 1 run tapped through third man"

205,"Tye to Root, 1 run nudged off the hip"
206,"Tye to Rashid, OUT run out! Stabbed to point, and just the minutest hesitation does for Rashid, as a screaming shy from point plucks out the non-striker's poles!"

216,"Tye to Root, 1 run bottom-handed biff to mid-on"
217,"Tye to Willey, OUT a mow over the leg side, and another catch in the deep! And was that another Tye slower ball? Certainly looked as though Willey was through his shot early, flapping the ball much squarer than he might have intended.

230,"Tye to Ball, OUT well bowled! And that is five for Tye! Yorker, straight and true, rattles the timbers, and England's innings has come to an ignominious end"
231,"2.55pm So that's the end of that. England have a decent total on the board, but significantly less than they would have envisaged at 151 for 2 in the 26th over. But Andrew Tye's exceptional variations unpicked their set batsmen, and failed to let the new ones settle. After looking all at sea at 3-0 down, Australia are suddenly well placed to finish the series on a high. Back in 30 for the chase."
232,3.15pm: It's been a good half an hour for Andrew Tye - he's just been sold for $1.1m in the IPL auction
233,"Right, shall we tango? England have more than they made in Adelaide to defend, but fewer than they would have wanted, given the start they made... David Willey, who knows his way around Perth, will start off to David Warner. Two slips in"

239,"Willey to Head, no run curling away in the channel, an encouraging start for Willey, left alone"
240,"Willey to Head, FOUR runs full, swinging and clubbed to the rope! Head reaches out and batters Willey through the covers for the first four of the day, to beery cheers around the Perth Stadium... So much for encouragement"
241,"Tom Curran to Warner, 2 runs over the wicket, pitched up a touch too straight, 136kph and helped off the pads past mid-on for a couple"
242,"Tom Curran to Warner, 3 runs full outside off, shaping in a fraction but Warner just bullies it on the up, crunched past the dive at cover point for a couple"

244,"Tom Curran to Head, no run short and wide, slashed and he gets a thick edge - but Bairstow drops it at first slip! A dolly drop and Head gets a life, he was maybe distracted by Buttler moving across to his left but still should have held it"
