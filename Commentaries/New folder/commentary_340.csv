217,"Maxwell to Hales, 2 runs another juicy full toss, swung through the leg side and this time deep midwicket gets around"
218,"Faulkner to Wright, 2 runs full at leg stump, flicked in the air through midwicket"

220,"Faulkner to Morgan, 2 runs he's away this time, cuts this through backward point and places it wide of third man"

225,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run driven straight to mid-off...Morgan felt he had to get the dive out"
226,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, (no ball) 2 runs bonus for England, this is a no-ball which Hales flicks high in the air to split deep midwicket and long-on"
227,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, 2 runs can't really make the most of it, gets another length ball but Hales' bat twists in his hands and the shot lobs between fielders on the off side"
228,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, FOUR runs backs to leg and carves this over backward point, wrong length again...into the 90s"
229,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 run gets inside the line and pulls but picks out short fine-leg"
230,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 2 runs wide outside off, driven high over the covers but the sweeper is able to cut off the boundary...productive over"
231,"Faulkner to Hales, 1 run full outside off, driven to long-off"

233,"Faulkner to Morgan, no run good delivery, yorker at middle stump, he can't beat midwicket"
234,"Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run excellent again, speared in towards middle and leg, they scamper one to midwicket this time"
235,"Faulkner to Hales, 2 runs missed out, really, on a big full toss as he clubs it straight down the ground for a couple"
236,"Faulkner to Hales, OUT still no hundred for England...gets another low full toss which he clouts towards the bottom of the bat and is well taken, low at long-on"
237,"Fawad to Buttler, OUT well bowled! lovely delivery from Ahmed, bravely flighted up. It grips and spins past Buttler's prod as he just tried to dab it into the off side"
238,"Fawad to Bopara, 1 run swept off leg stump out to deep square"
239,"Fawad to Morgan, SIX runs all the way...Morgan connects cleanly with a slog-sweep and that was always heading into the crowd"
240,"Fawad to Morgan, OUT gone this time, with a googly, Morgan hits it firmly but without the height or distance and picks out deep midwicket"
241,"Fawad to Root, 1 run confidence of youth...reverse sweep first ball but it goes straight to backward point"
242,"Fawad to Bopara, no run fired in outside leg, but Bopara has moved so far outside the stumps that when he misses it goes inside his body. Dot ball to finish"
243,"Australia have managed to keep England under 200. Good last over from Ahmed. But England played well. Hales and Lumb laid the platform with a hundred stand. So, can Finch knock these off? Join Alan in a few minutes to find out."
244,"Hello everyone. A decent total from England, though, with Aaron Finch in their rearview mirror, they won't be too comfortable - and he doesn't need any help in looking big. However, Australia have only once chased anything like this total, during Mike Hussey's match against Pakistan in the 2010 World Twen"

252,"Broad to Finch, FOUR runs pitched up outside off, not a half-volley but hit cleanly on the up over mid-off for four"
253,"Broad to Finch, OUT swats across the line, top-edged and the ball loops tamely to mid-on! England have slain the beast!

261,"Finn to Watson, OUT superb bit fielding from Morgan, a direct hit from backward point and Watson is gone for all money!

265,"Broad to Warner, no run bit of width, stays back and cuts a length ball into the ground to point"
266,"Broad to Warner, FOUR runs short and wide again, gets this away behind square with a vicious thrash of the hands, excellent bat speed and the ball flies to the boundary"
267,"Broad to Warner, no run Broad continues to bowl wide of the stumps, Warner clatters the ball to point again"
268,"Broad to Warner, 1 run fires it wide of the off again, steered through backward point, third man covers it"

351,"Dernbach to Maxwell, no run beaten first up, basically he missed his drive at a length delivery"
352,"Dernbach to Faulkner, OUT what a catch! Superb from Morgan at backward point. It was a very sharp bouncer, Faulkner was in a horrid tangle as he tried to pull. Comes off the shoulder of the bat and it appeared it would fly just over Morgan, but he turned then pulled out a big leap to hold the catch"

England and Australia will then lock horns in five ODIs starting next Friday. We'll bring you all the action as always. For now, though,"
491,"England win by 27 runs and it was a very efficient all-round display. Batted powerfully, mostly bowled with verve and the fielding was solid. That means the series is shared 1-1. I really wish these one-day legs of tours were three matches of each length (20 and 50) because often these T20 series are draw"
492,England won by 27 runs
493,"Player of the match is Alex Hales, ENG"
