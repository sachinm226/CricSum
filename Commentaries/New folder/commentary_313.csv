0,"News from the 'G' is that Australia have won the toss and asked Sri Lanka to bat first. It's the first time in seven limited overs matches that the tourists will bat first, if I'm not mistaken. They have built each of their three victories on bowling first, so it will be interesting to see how they react to having to set a score, and indeed, how A"
1,"Maxwell to Dilshan, no run fullish in middle stump from around the wicket, driven to mid on"
2,"Maxwell to Dilshan, 3 runs dropped second ball! Terrific effort though. Dilshan goes aerial over mid on, and Ben Laughlin runs around from cow corner, to try to take the mishit stroke, but can't complete the catch on it despite having put in a big dive"
3,"Maxwell to Perera, no run tossed up wide and spinning sharply away, Perera misses"
4,"Maxwell to Perera, 1 run flighted on off, driven to long off"

8,"Starc to Dilshan, no run angled wide again, on a length. Dilshan drives away from his body, but straight to cover"
9,"Starc to Dilshan, no run bouncer on off stump, Dilshan shapes to hook but ends up leaving it"
10,"Starc to Dilshan, 1 run full and angled across, Dilshan drives again, but with no timing, the batsmen scamper one into the off side"

13,"Starc to Perera, 1 wide wide again, down full and down the leg side"

15,"Starc to Perera, no run length on the stumps, defended on the front foot."
16,"Faulkner to Dilshan, 1 run full and on off stump, Dilshan drives it straight, but can't time it again. They take one as mid off comes around to field"
17,"Faulkner to Perera, 1 run shortish and wide, cut aerially, but in between the fielders. There's a lot of Jayasuriya in that shot. long leg runs around to field"
18,"Faulkner to Dilshan, no run slower ball on a length, Dilshan is too early on the drive and misses"
19,"Faulkner to Dilshan, 4 leg byes poor bowling, fine leg in the circle, but Faulkner bowls this on leg stump and it takes a deflection off Dilshan's thigh pad and rolls to the boundary"
20,"Faulkner to Dilshan, OUT slower ball again, and this time he bowls him! Dilshan tried to pull that one, but it didn't bounce as high as he expected. It takes an under edge and clips off stump. I think the slowness of the ball did him in there."

22,"Starc to Perera, no run shortish and outside off stump, cut hard, but straight to backward point"
23,"Starc to Perera, no run almost a run out! Fullish on the stumps, Perera pushes that straight to mid on, and calls no early, but Chandimal has scampered a couple of metres down the pitch. He turns, but a direct hit would have beaten his dive"

25,"Starc to Perera, no run slower ball, pushed back to the bowler on the front foot"
26,"Starc to Perera, 1 wide way down leg, and Wade dives well to stop that from being only one wide"
27,"Starc to Perera, FOUR runs dear me that is a fine shot. Is that you Sanath? Fullish and outside off stump, Perera gets his front foot across and creams that through cover on the up. That flew off the bat."
28,"Starc to Perera, FOUR runs and he's wise enough to deal with the variation as well. Slower ball outside off stump, a little short. Perera drags that behind square on the leg side for four. Another good shot"

34,"Faulkner to Perera, no run leg cutter, 113 kph. Breaks a little off the surface and evades Perera's push. Terrific over"
35,"Laughlin to Chandimal, FOUR runs slower ball to start, but Chandimal isn't fooled by that one. Plays a lovely cover drive to an overpitched delivery and pierces the infield"
36,"Laughlin to Chandimal, no run length outside off stump, cut hard into the square, but David Warner fields that at backward point"
37,"Laughlin to Chandimal, OUT that is an awful looking shot. Short outside off stump, Chandimal tries to heave that over mid on with a cross-bat shot, but is too late on the stroke, and ends up scooping it to Bailey at mid off. Didn't look too comfortable, despite the boundary"
38,"Laughlin to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run short outside off stump, glides it down to third man"

43,"Maxwell to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run tossed up outside off stump, defended into a gap on the off side"
44,"Maxwell to Perera, OUT well caught, running back. Perera is down the track, but beaten in the flight by Maxwell and he hits that high. Bailey runs back from cover to take a difficult catch over his shoulder. Perera perishes again, having promised much early on. Sri Lanka need a partnership here though."

65,"Doherty to Jeevan Mendis, no run full and flat, defended with a straight bat"

73,"Doherty to Jeevan Mendis, FOUR runs short, on leg stump, and Mendis swings that behind square on the leg side for four. Doherty might have bowled shorter because Mendis was looking like he'd shuffle down the pitch"

81,"Laughlin to Jeevan Mendis, 1 run oh deear! Laughlin just had to pick up the ball, and he would have had Mahela out. Mendis gets bat on a slower ball, and it dribbles down past his feet.

110,"Starc to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs trouble for Sri Lanka, but he might just be safe. Mahela opens up and drives that past cover, but they take off for a risky second. The throw comes to Perera's end, but he's just made it."

127,"Good innings by Mahela, to hold things together after three wickets fell quickly. Perera played a blinder, as Australia's bowlers shied away from bowling yorkers at the death. But the good start for Australia means that 161 is probably just about par."
128,We'll be back in a mo with Australia's reply.

209,"Malinga to Bailey, FOUR runs beautifully played Bailey. You sensed it was coming. He moves towards the off side and plays the over the shoulder scoop. Absolutely middles it. Pressure on Malinga now."
210,"Malinga to Bailey, FOUR runs four more! Malinga misses his length by a foot and a half. Bailey picks that up from deep in the crease and lofts it over square leg for four."
211,"Malinga to Bailey, 2 runs full and wide of the off stump, Bailey drives that just wide of the cover sweeper and there is time for two, particularly as the return is no good"
212,"Malinga to Bailey, 1 run Bailey sets himself for another scoop, but Malinga goes really wide this time, almost pitching it off the cut strip. Bailey can only get an inside edge and the scramble one"
213,"Malinga to Marsh, FOUR runs what a shot! Best of the day there! Malinga overpitches again, and Marsh backs away to drive that hard to the cover fence. Hit it into the square, and it bounced over the cover fielder. Australia have a sniff here."
214,"Perera to Bailey, 2 runs full and outside off stump, hit into a gap on the packed offside field and they just scamper two"
215,"Perera to Marsh, (no ball) 2 runs waist-high full toss, and that is hit almost all the way. Kulasekara takes it on the boundary, but has to let it go lest he fall over the boundary. It's a no-ball, so there's still four balls remaining, and an extra run."
216,"Perera to Marsh, 1 run yorker on leg stump, Marsh can't get hold of it. Dribbles back to Perera on the pitch. He shies at the stumps, but Australia decide against the overthrow"
217,"Perera to Maxwell, FOUR runs full outside off stump, Maxwell gets low and slices it over point for four. Australia are still in it. Great shot first up."
218,"Perera to Maxwell, FOUR runs another one. Full toss outside off stump again, and that's carved over point for a second time. The crowd is going nuts at the MCG. What a super hand from Maxwell."
219,"Perera to Maxwell, 1 bye swing and a miss! Sri Lanka sneak through! The ball was there for Maxwell. Wide again, and slightly overpitched, but he makes room and misses it this time. Chandimal collects cleanly and runs forward jubilantly."
220,"Tempers are really flaring here. Looks like Maxwell is riled up about the extra time that Sri Lanka took before the final ball, and there are about four or five Sri Lankan players who are right in there, arguing animatedly with him. That's about as irate as I have ever seen Mahela, and Dilshan seems pretty worked up as well. Matthew Wade getting s"
221,Thisara Perera has been adjudged man of the match for his 35 off 15 and 1 for 25 from three overs.
222,"In the end, you've got to say Sri Lanka deserved to take it out. The D/L recalculation made things a touch tougher for them, but they gritted it out well, even with a damp ball. A valiant effort from Marsh and Bailey, but Australia just gave away too much ground in the early overs."
223,"That's about it for our coverage for this cracker of a match. Glad you could be with us. So Sri Lanka finally have something to take away from the tour, even if it was just in the Twenty20s. Until next time, ciao!"
224,Sri Lanka won by 2 runs (D/L method)
225,"Player of the match is Thisara Perera, SL"
