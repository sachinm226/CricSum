18,"10:15pm Another comprehensive defeat for the hosts then, two in a row and suddenly we are primed for a series decider. It was a tricky pitch to bat on and New Zealand didn't find a single phase in the innings where they'd figured out run-scoring. Australia built the pressure early on, took the pace off when they had to and snuck in extra spin overs from Maxwell too to completely bully New Zealand in chase. Once again, the hosts were left with no chance."

He's such a dynamic player (Maxi), he always wants to be in the action - he's a great player to balance out your side. We've been trying to be a bit more aggresive with the batting but when you lose wickets, it gets tougher, so we looked to take it deeper [today] and got some good momentum going into the"
