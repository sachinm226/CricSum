,Data
0,"Santner to Warner, no run slides a short ball across the batsman, cut away but straight to point"
1,"Santner to Warner, FOUR runs just short of Neesham at short third man. Too full for the cut, Warner still went through with it and managed to get a thick edge that raced past the man there for a boundary"
2,"Santner to Warner, no run gets to the pitch of the ball and hammers it straight to Williamson at cover"
3,"Santner to Warner, no run this is much better, slower through the air and lands it at length on middle, Warner stretches forward and blocks"
4,"Santner to Warner, no run flatter one on middle and leg, worked with the spin to midwicket"
5,"Santner to Warner, 1 run worked off his hip to square leg. Warner's just played a series of dots. Wow"
6,"Southee to Warner, 1 run"
7,"Southee to Finch, 1 run length ball that slides into middle and leg, worked to mid-on as they sneak in a single. Warner trusted his partner's call and took off in a jiffy"
8,"Southee to Warner, 1 run digs a short ball into the body, not alarming bounce, neither was the pace that threatening. Warner gets on top of the bounce and deflects it wide of square leg"
9,"Southee to Finch, 1 run half-volley on the pads, flicked with the angle to deep fine leg. The fielder there didn't have to move an inch"
10,"Southee to Warner, no run back of length delivery on off stump, he hops back and bunts it to short cover"
11,"Southee to Warner, FOUR runs superb hand-eye coordination. Picks the length so early. Stayed back in the crease, waited for it and flayed it behind point. Those wrists. Superb. Square third man was a mere spectator."
12,"Santner to Finch, 1 wide drifts this back into middle and leg, Finch attempts a sweep and manages a glove. The keeper fluffs a relatively simple chance. Wide called"
13,"Santner to Finch, no run tossed up on middle, he gets forward and pats it to the off side"
14,"Santner to Finch, OUT so the dropped chance didn't cost them much. Finch looks to play a predetermined sweep. Was across a long way even before the ball was delivered, so he was in no position to sweep that full delivery. He swung through way too early as well as the ball sneaked through to crash into"
15,"Santner to Smith, no run some purchase off the pitch. This one turn's away from off stump, but Smith is half forward as he defends"

20,"Southee to Smith, no run short of length delivery around the sixth stump outside off, Smith watches it through to the keeper"

22,"Southee to Smith, no run gets across and squeezes this full delivery to Williamson at cover"
23,"Southee to Smith, no run this is too full, he doesn't get underneath it. Jams his bat down to keep that out though"

34,"Southee to Smith, no run this is superb from Southee. This one's pitched up. The ball deviates away a wee bit, and Smith watches it through to the keeper"
35,"Southee to Smith, no run shapes to cut but realises the ball's too full for him to slash, lets it go instead"
36,"Southee to Smith, 1 run gets half-forward and bunts it towards cover, which is a little deep, and they get a single easily"
37,"Santner to Smith, 1 run eased with the spin to long-off, too full from Santner on that occasion"
38,"Santner to Warner, no run steps out but this one drifts away to beat the flick and hit him on the right thigh. Excellent from Santner. That's more like it."
39,"Santner to Warner, no run gets to the pitch of the ball and dabs a tossed up delivery back down to the bowler"
40,"Santner to Warner, no run quicker one on middle and leg, tucked to square leg"
41,"Santner to Warner, 1 run slow turn back in, Warner was standing outside leg in anticipation of a full ball, just works it wide of square leg this time"
42,"Santner to Smith, no run shaped to drive but ended up defending solidly once he realised he was beaten in flight"
43,"Southee to Warner, no run low full toss, Warner could have actually swung across but instead waits and waits for it and ends up nearly yorking himself as he digs that out"
44,"Southee to Warner, no run mistimes an attempted drive to short cover. Pressure building? This has been an excellent comeback. Warner's timing has suddenly gone awry"

49,"Santner to Smith, 1 run eased with the spin to long-off as they jog the single"
50,"Santner to Warner, FOUR runs sweeps and gets a bottom edge which is enough to beat short fine leg. Half-century for him, not a typically robust innings but he'll still take it. Coming back to the fielding effort, it could have been a better one from Trent Boult. Shouldn't have been more than two."

52,"Santner to Smith, 2 runs short and wide, he rocks back and cracks it into the gap at deep point"
53,"Santner to Smith, no run gives it generous amount of flight on off, Smith gets forward and blocks"

152,"Boult to Warner, no run too full outside off, squeezed to cover"
153,"Boult to Warner, FOUR runs low full toss on the pads, tickled into the fine leg boundary. Buffet bowling this, as Geoff Boycott would say. All he had to do to get a boundary was a faint deflection, which he did."

170,"de Grandhomme to Head, FOUR runs Head's time to come to the party. Backs away and slaps that over the infield. The width was there and he muscled that away."
171,"de Grandhomme to Head, SIX runs clean strike and a massive hit! Bleeding runs suddenly. Too full and angling into middle, Head stays inside the crease and slugs it over midwicket. Short boundary that side too"

173,"de Grandhomme to Smith, 1 leg bye"
174,"de Grandhomme to Head, FOUR runs backs away and hammers it down the ground. The ball had passed the bowler even before he could react. Mid-off was inside the ring, so once it went past the bowler, it was four all the way. Sparkling batting this from the new batsman"
175,"de Grandhomme to Head, no run cuts, but finds backward point"
176,"Southee to Smith, OUT as easy as they come for Santner. This was a length ball outside off, Smith went across to play an agricultural heave but only managed to get the outside part of the bat to slice it to deep point. Not even the possibility of another century deterred him from playing his shots. End"

178,"Southee to Head, 1 run gets a thick edge this time as he looks to cut, on the bounce to third man"

183,"Henry to Head, FOUR runs full and outside off, Head clears his front leg and hoists it down the ground, straight of long-off. Neesham over-runs the ball to his left, and concedes a four. Another example of sloppy fielding from NZ"

211,"Boult to Head, 1 run full on middle, belted to Williamson at mid-off"

235,"6.20pm Australia have plundered 126 runs in the last 10 overs to run up 378 for 5, the second-highest total at the Manuka Oval. Warner, who struck his sixth ODI century of the year, and Smith, who made 72, set a strong base for the hosts. Head and Marsh then launched from there, scoring brutal half-centuries."

237,"Starc to Guptill, no run starts off with a high full toss on middle, pushed to the off side"
238,"Starc to Guptill, no run big appeal for lbw. Possibly, pad first? They decide against a review. The ball bends back in to beat him on the forward prod. The line was good, but there was some bat involved too. Good decision from Kumar Dharmasena"

264,"Starc to Latham, no run firm push but straight to cover"

273,"Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 run whipped off his hip towards the man coming in from deep square, the throw went to the wrong end, but overthrows at the bowler's end means there's no damage done. Williamson was nearly halfway down the pitch when he had to turn back"
274,"Cummins to Guptill, no run starts off with a yorker length delivery outside off, squeezed to cover"
275,"Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs has he broken his bat? It was full and he crashes that past mid-off. Geez, that was nowhere near the middle but it still travelled"
276,"Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs just a hint of width and he's hit that on the rise again. Free flow of the bat as it comes down nicely. He's really timing them sweetly"

This one was full, it came back in from wide of the crease and then held its line as Guptill's poke took the thinnest of edges on the way through to Wade. Special ball that."
