604,That's it from us at Cricinfo today. Thanks for the mails and the company. Do joins us again on Monday for the Mohali game.
605,"""On this wicket, I think everybody bowled well. I'm really happy. If there was no dew 220-230 could have been difficult to chase. The pitch was looking really ugly. All in all, it was a great team effort."""
606,"""The ball change was the best time to score (when Aus were batting) but we lost a bit of momentum there. India outplayed us today. It was definitely a better batting surface earlier in the day. We have lost two games in a row, hopefully we'll get a few more runs"
607,Post-match presentation:
608,"Yuvraj and Dhoni made the difference today. A 148-run stand in a low-scoring game was too much for Australia to overcome. They fought till the end though, but just couldn't get the breakthrough they needed. India were certainly nervous after Gambhir was dismissed"
609,India won by 6 wickets (with 10 balls remaining)
610,"Player of the match is Yuvraj Singh, INDIA"
