0,"""You've never posted any of my comments but hopefully this one makes it through. On this tour India have won 3 of 13 tosses in all internationals, Aus 9 of 13 and SL 4 of 6. This tour has confirmed my view of the failings of using a random activity to decide such an important part of each game. I think there should only be one toss at the start of each series. The winner chooses for the first game and then it alternates. This way there is at least"
1,"Praveen to Warner, no run full swinging ball, lands on middle and straightens down the line. Warner defends off the front foot."
2,"Praveen to Warner, no run 125.5 kph, but the ball again straightens nicely from a full length outside off. Warner defends to point with an opened face."
3,"Praveen to Warner, no run Warner gets a little too far across as he defends another ball that straightens from middle and off."
4,"Praveen to Warner, no run back of a length, PK is getting the ball to angle in and go straight. Warner defends."
5,"Praveen to Warner, no run goes further short, but no width - generally good lines. Warner defends to cover."
6,"Praveen to Warner, no run top start from PK. After getting five of them to go away, he bends one in drastically and catches Warner unawares. The ball bursts through to hit his pad as he looks to work to leg from the crease."
7,"Pathan to Watson, no run swing for Irfan now. The ball yo-yos back into Watson from outside off, and he defends cautiously with bat and pad thrust forward."
8,"Pathan to Watson, no run 133 kph, fuller and swinging down the line. Watson gets the front pad across and plays a tad around it, to the leg side."
9,"Pathan to Watson, no run Watson defends with very soft hands as Irfan swings it in again. Played so softly that it spun back, but didn't go near the stumps."
10,"Pathan to Watson, no run this is a good start from India. Ten balls on the money. Irfan again looks for the lbw with a pleasing shape into the right hander. Watson inside-edges the front-foot defensive onto his pad."
11,"Pathan to Watson, 1 run Australia are away. Watson is away. Short of a length outside off, he stays back and chops it to Umesh at third man."
12,"Pathan to Warner, FOUR runs too short, but gets it to swing again. Warner stays back and gets a thick edge as the ball deviates away from his clam-fisted steer. The edge flies over the heads of the slip fielders down to the third man boundary."
13,"Praveen to Watson, no run back of a length to Watson, he defends after getting half forward. Soft hands again, very typical of Watson."
14,"Praveen to Watson, OUT If you remember the CB Series final from 2008, this is almost exactly how PK got rid of Ricky Ponting. Back of a length, a hint of wobble away from the batsman. Watson goes back and looks to bang it over the leg side, but miscues it, perhaps because of the deviation away from the bat, and the pull loops gingerly to mid-on. India have struck early, Watson goes back after a short-lived comeback."
15,"Praveen to Forrest, no run PK continues to swerve it away from the right hander, but this is too wide of off stump to trouble Forrest."
16,"Praveen to Forrest, no run makes him play with a fuller length ball. Forrest plays the line cautiously. Defended to the off side."
17,"Praveen to Forrest, no run back of a length, Forrest pokes it to the off side from the crease."
18,"Praveen to Forrest, 1 run Forrest is away, as PK bowls his first ball that's not on target. On the pads, nudged cautiously in front of square leg for one."
19,"Pathan to Forrest, no run PK curls one in from outside off and Forrest is caught pushing tentatively inside the line... India are abuzz here."
20,"Pathan to Forrest, no run straighter, swinging in towards middle and off, and it is defended to the on side."
21,"Pathan to Forrest, no run stays crease-bound and blocks a length ball to cover."
22,"Pathan to Forrest, no run Forrest stays in the crease and defends to the off side again. He does play a generous number of dot-balls this man. Though, this is still early days in his innings."
23,"Pathan to Forrest, no run the sucker ball, Irfan gets it to hold its line as it angles across. Forrest wisely lets it go."
24,"Pathan to Forrest, no run pins him in the crease yet again with a length ball that straightens. Forrest blocks to mid-on. Maiden for Irfan now."
25,"Praveen to Warner, 1 run Warner pushes a single into the wide mid-off region as PK keeps it on a length outside off."
26,"Praveen to Forrest, no run PK gets so close to the stumps from over the wicket that he knocks the bails off. (No, he wasn't attempting the Mankad.) Forrest defends from the crease to point."
27,"Praveen to Forrest, 1 wide PK slants one too far down the leg side and it is called a wide. First really poor ball of the day."
28,"Praveen to Forrest, 1 run short of a length outside off. Forrest opens the face and dabs to point for a single."
29,"Praveen to Warner, 1 run the big curve-ball from PK that bends in drastically from wide of the crease, round the stumps, and restricts Warner's scoring ideas through the off side. This came in too far, and Warner tucked it to the leg side for one."
30,"Praveen to Forrest, no run and this one comes in sharply the other way. Can you believe India have been benching this man through the series? Forrest manages to keep this one out."
31,"Praveen to Forrest, no run straighter this time, Forrest can't work the ball away cleanly off the pads."
32,"Pathan to Warner, 3 runs top timing from Warner. He sets up a solid base as he shuffles across and punches hard wide of mid-on. Gambhir's the man there, and he chases it down and slides to pull it in."
33,"Pathan to Forrest, FOUR runs finally some release for Australia. Irfan drifts the indipper onto the pads, and Forrest smartly gets inside the line and helps it along to fine leg. Easy runs."
34,"Pathan to Forrest, no run over-pitched outside off stump, Forrest makes a proud front-foot press and drives to mid-off."
35,"Pathan to Forrest, 1 run edgy, but safe. Stays back and goes at a short ball angling across with hard hands. There's no one at gully to catch it."
36,"Pathan to Warner, 4 leg byes Irfan's fluffed his lines in this over. This one goes too far down the leg side as he attempts a yorker, and it goes off Warner's boot to fine leg as he attempts the flick."
37,"Pathan to Warner, 1 run hard hands again. 132 kph, Irfan swings it away from Warner, who edges it through gully which is vacant once more. 13 off the over."
38,"Praveen to Warner, 3 runs jabbed away. PK drops marginally short, Warner falls back in the crease and whips efficiently through wide mid-on. Gambhir is again the man chasing, and the fielding wasn't too shabby. Three runs taken though."
39,"Praveen to Forrest, OUT PK does it again. Slower ball from PK, he rolled the fingers over and got it to stop on Forrest and go away. Forrest tries to push to the off side, but gets a thin inside edge that drops onto the stumps."
40,"Praveen to Hussey, no run angled across Huss from over the stumps. He stays in the crease and shoulders arms."
41,"Praveen to Hussey, no run back of a length this time, Hussey stays in the crease and defends compactly."
42,"Praveen to Hussey, no run pitched up wide of off stump and it straightens down the line. Hussey doesn't try to play it."
43,"Praveen to Hussey, no run sharp slant away from the left hander. PK has made a strong comeback to the India side. Hussey lets this one go."
44,"Pathan to Warner, 2 runs Warner seems to have got the measure of Irfan at the moment. Back of a length again, the ball straightens into the middle of Warner's bat as he punches between point and cover."
45,"Pathan to Warner, no run fuller length, draws Warner forward and gets him to block to mid-on."
46,"Pathan to Warner, FOUR runs rubbish ball, carved away with intent. 134 kph, pitched well up and swinging, but it was about two feet wide of off stump. Warner did well to reach it despite not moving the feet and just slashed it over the covers."
47,"Pathan to Warner, FOUR runs Warner's toying with Irfan now. Over-compensates with a short of length offering, Warner jumps back - he seemed to expect that - and whips gloriously through midwicket for four more."
48,"Pathan to Warner, no run another poor ball, this time he escapes. Warner hacks a short and wide ball without timing to short cover."
49,"Pathan to Warner, no run and again. Over-pitched on the pads, that was asking to be swiped through midwicket, but Warner finds the fielder. 23 from 2 very average overs from Irfan, after a strong start."
50,"Praveen to Hussey, no run PK continues to drop on a good length and angle it across the left hander. Hussey leaves."
51,"Praveen to Hussey, no run shapes away after angling across towards off stump. Another leave from Hussey."
52,"Praveen to Hussey, no run full length ball on off stump, Hussey reaches out to cover the line and blocks to cover."
53,"Praveen to Hussey, no run pitched up wide of off stump, Hussey lets another one go."
54,"Praveen to Hussey, 1 run edged, but safe. Hussey was looking to swing what seemed to be a short ball angling across him to the leg side, but the ball swing away devilishly to take a top edge. It flew high but didn't have the legs to carry to third man. And third man (Ashwin) surely didn't have the legs to get anywhere near it. Landed at least 10 yards away."
55,"Praveen to Warner, no run short of a length to Warner, he stays in the crease and defends to the off side."
56,"Pathan to Hussey, no run full length from over the stumps, and Hussey defends."
57,"Pathan to Hussey, no run Irfan surely prefers having Warner at his end. Hussey leans out and defends to point again."
58,"Pathan to Hussey, 1 run Hussey drives a full swinging ball to mid-off and sets off for a quick single. Gambhir fields, the ball is following Senior No. 3 today."
59,"Pathan to Warner, 1 run angled into Warner's pads and he whips behind square for a single."
60,"Pathan to Hussey, 1 run another single for Hussey, who presses forward and pushes into the covers."
61,"Pathan to Warner, 1 run Warner's turn now to push a length ball past short cover for another single."
62,"Praveen to Warner, no run that swung in from wide of the crease. PK must love this two new-balls rule. Warner stays back and defends to the off side."
63,"Praveen to Warner, 1 run shorter and straighter. Warner goes back in the crease and forces through wide mid-on for a single."
64,"Praveen to Hussey, FOUR runs PK is hit for a four at long last. Hussey gets a fractionally shorter ball outside off and guides it expertly through cover point for four. Timing at its best."
65,"Praveen to Hussey, no run back of a length again, but no width. Hussey defends to the off side."
66,"Praveen to Hussey, no run back of a length outside off from round the stumps. Hussey stays in the crease and chops to point."
67,"Praveen to Hussey, no run angled in from wide of the crease. Hussey defends towards mid-on."
68,"Ashwin to Warner, no run tossed up outside off, Warner lunges out confidently and drives to mid-off."
69,"Ashwin to Warner, no run straighter, that drifted in towards the pad and Warner defends."
70,"Ashwin to Warner, no run tossed up on middle and leg, and straightening. Warner plays it back to the bowler."
71,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run on the pad, Warner works it behind square for a single."
72,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run tossed up on Hussey's pads, he turns it straight to midwicket."
73,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run good start from Ashwin. Flighted outside off and Hussey leans out to defend to the covers."
74,"Praveen to Warner, 2 runs inside edged, but past the stumps. Short of a length ball outside off, Warner tries to cut despite having no room and chops it past the stumps. He hustles back for the second. Top running this."
75,"Praveen to Warner, 2 runs on the pads this time, and Warner plays that punchy whip for the nth time today. Two more through midwicket, and the 50 is up. Most of them, courtesy Irfan Pathan."
76,"Praveen to Warner, no run pushes Warner back with a 125 kph ball. Warner stays back and defends to the leg side."
77,"Praveen to Warner, no run angled into the pads once more. Warner tucks it straight to midwicket."
78,"Praveen to Warner, 1 wide slow bumper at 124 kph. The leg umpire calls it a wide as Warner lets it go."
79,"Praveen to Warner, 1 run onto the pads again. PK is not swinging it much any more. Warner tucks it square for a single."
80,"Praveen to Hussey, 2 runs what delightful running from Hussey and Warner! Back of a length and on the pads, Hussey turns it to square leg dexterously and sets off. Jadeja had acres to cover before he could get ti it, and that allowed a couple more to be added."
81,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run slow, high and loopy on the stumps. Warner presses forward and drives through mid-off for a single"
82,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run, OUT a youngster misfields, and it results in a run-out. Maybe, MS Dhoni has a point. Tossed up on off stump, Hussey leans out and drives it straight through Raina at short cover. The single is taken, as Irfan runs around from wide long-off to field it. They decide to go for the second even as Irfan lines up his throw. And then Warner sends Hussey back. No chance. Good throw, straight to Ashwin, who whips the bails o"
83,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 wide slips this one down the leg side."
84,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run flighted outside off, Warner drives to Irfan again, and this time Irfan fumbles a couple of times. No harm done."
85,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run spin and bounce, and an appeal for a bat-pad chance. DJ was looking to flick and missed. It went off pad to the leg side and Dhoni ran across to pouch it."
86,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run DJ is away, the ball spins in towards the pads and is tucked towards the leg side for one."
87,"Ashwin to Warner, 2 runs too short. Warner hacks it square for a single ... PK misfields now and they come back for the second. Whoa, PK nearly throws the stumps down from 50 yards away, but DJ seemed safely in anyway."
88,"Yadav to Hussey, 2 runs Praveen misfields again. Short of a length outside off, punched into the covers and his misfield allows the second."
89,"Yadav to Hussey, 3 runs over-pitched to DJ, who drives superbly through mid-off. The dive is in vain, and Tiwary runs back towards the boundary to pull it in."
90,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs short ball from Yadav, shoddy start from him, and Warner's looking increasingly comfortable. He skips back and heaves easily off the hips through backward square leg for four more.,"
91,"Yadav to Warner, no run goes very full now, he isn't trying the in-between lengths at all. Warner drills it straight to mid-off."
92,"Yadav to Warner, no run 146 kph, but Warner is still early on the push-drive. He nearly scoops it straight to mid-off, but it drops short ..."
93,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run angled into the pads now, Warner slaps it from the crease through backward square leg for a single."
94,"Ashwin to Warner, no run drifts in from back of a length, and Warner defends to the leg side."
95,"Ashwin to Warner, no run short of a length, but no width for Warner as he tries to cut. Can't time it and it is fielded at cover."
96,"Ashwin to Warner, no run three dots to start the PP. Tossed up on the stumps and played back to the bowler."
97,"Ashwin to Warner, 2 runs Warner gets the score going again, worked off the pads through wide mid-on. Gambhir is the man on the boundary and they take a two. He hits the stumps, but DJ is well in."
98,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run short to Warner, he hacks again and PK puts in a tumble to field it in the covers."
99,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run full and straightening from the off stump line. Defended off the front foot."
100,"Yadav to Warner, no run over-pitched on the pads, Warner drills it straight to mid-on. That was a boundary ball."
101,"Yadav to Warner, 2 runs another shoddy delivery, angling helpfully onto the pads and Warner clips it through midwicket for a couple."
102,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs Warner at his best, and he has a 50 at long last! Over-pitched once more by Umesh, who is looking out of depth in this format. Warner sets himself up strongly in the crease, waits to get under the ball and bangs it away through the covers for four."
103,"Yadav to Warner, no run on a length outside off stump, chopped without much timing to point."
104,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs Dhoni should make a note in his scratch pad. Gambhir has conceded two runs with his sloppiness on the third man boundary. Umesh delivers a short slower all wide of off stump at 115 kph. Warner cracks it away through point, and Gambhir doesn't bend low enough to stop it on the boundary. India are slackening alarmingly."
105,"Yadav to Warner, no run better ball. Good length at good pace on the stumps, and defended to the leg side."
106,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run tossed up on the pads, worked with the angle to the leg side for one."
107,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run Ashwin lets one through now, though DJ unintentionally may have made it tough for him. Full ball on the stumps, pushed past Ashwin for one."
108,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run there's a single for DJ every single ball if he wants it. Ashwin tossed up on the toes, DK tuns it to the leg side for one. Easy."
109,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run Warner punches to the leg side for one now."
110,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run short of a length, same line and angle. DJ gets yet another single with a nudge to leg."
111,"Ashwin to Warner, no run tossed up on the off stump, Warner leans out and drives to cover. Dot ball after five singles."

113,"Jadeja to Warner, 1 run back of a length on the pads, Warner turns it square for another single."
114,"Jadeja to Hussey, 1 run loopy ball that curves in from wide of the crease. DJ presses forward and drives through mid-off for one."
115,"Jadeja to Warner, 1 run flatter and on the pads, easy single for Warner to the leg side."
116,"Jadeja to Hussey, 1 run good line and a hint of inward drift. DJ has no problem driving it through extra cover for one."
117,"Jadeja to Warner, 3 runs short ball at long last. Warner thumps it away wide of mid-off and Ashwin labours after it before pulling it in on the boundary. Bollywood actors run faster than that in slow-motion sequences."
118,"Ashwin to Warner, FOUR runs listless bowling this. Ashwin drops another one short and Warner knifes it away into the covers for four more."
119,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run fuller, Warner leans out and pushes to long-off for a single."
120,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run tossed up outside off, and are my eyes playing tricks on me, or did DJ miss out on a single scoring option? Played back to the bowler."
121,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run DJ goes back in the crease and works a single to the leg side."
122,"Ashwin to Warner, no run Sehwag makes up for some of Gauti's shoddiness. Dives away at square leg and stop s a Warner pull."
123,"Ashwin to Warner, no run edged, but lands safe. Ashwin gets the ball to bounce on Warner who goes hard at a cut and gets a thick top edge. The ball loops up and lands just short of Tendulkar at short third man..."
124,"Jadeja to Hussey, 1 run back of a length outside off, DJ pushes through the covers for a single."
125,"Jadeja to Warner, no run full ball at 91.5 kph on the stumps. Warner defends to the off side."
126,"Jadeja to Warner, no run on the pads, Warner turns it square and Raina intercepts."
127,"Jadeja to Warner, 2 runs flighted generously, Warner drives through wide mid-off for two. Ashwin's throw comes back as slowly as he runs in the outfield."
128,"Jadeja to Warner, no run short of a length, Warner has no room to cut and finds point."
129,"Jadeja to Warner, OUT Australia lose one, India might have lost two. Full ball from Jadeja, Warner looked to sweep it with the turn, and got a top edge that took off into the Sydney sky. Raina runs back from square leg. Irfan runs in from deep fine leg. Like a silent movie, there was no calling between the two men, both transfixed on the orb in the sky. Irfan belatedly saw Raina hurtling towards him, and his eyes popped out in shock, but th"
130,"Ashwin to Wade, no run tossed up on the stumps, defended to the off side."
131,"Ashwin to Wade, 2 runs Warner is away, he leans out and defends to the off side. India's fielding continues to swing one way and another. A sloppy effort concedes the second."

133,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run pitched up on DJ's off stump, and he turns it to mid-on for one."

136,"Jadeja to Wade, 1 run Wade steals a single, leans out and defends to point for one."

138,"Jadeja to Wade, 2 runs short of a length and wide of leg stump. Wade slaps it down to fine leg instead of encashing the wide."

146,"Ashwin to Wade, no run fuller, Wade leans out and defends to the off side."
147,"Ashwin to Wade, 1 run Is history being made here? Dhoni has appealed for DJ's wicket for the batsman obstructing the field. What's with India captains and run outs! DJ could be in trouble here. Full ball on off stump, Wade drives to Raina at short cover for a quick single. The throw was heading towards Dhoni, DJ was unintentionally in the way as he ran a straight line from his crease. He puts his right hand out to stop the ball from hitting"

167,"Sehwag to Wade, no run full ball on the leg stump line, defended back to the bowler."
168,"Sehwag to Wade, 1 run good work from Umesh, but he throws to the wrong end. Wade was gone for all money as he ran back half the way for the second run, but Yadav had flung it to Dhoni's end. Dhoni's relay to the bowler's end missed. Ahem, Wade deliberately came in the way this time. Does anyone know the rules? I suspect I don't!"

205,"Sehwag to Hussey, no run back of a length on the stumps, DJ nudges with the turn to the leg side and misses out on another single."
206,"Sehwag to Hussey, FOUR runs he's made up for the two dots with a murderous pull as Sehwag drops hopelessly short. DJ pranced back in the crease and pulled resourcefully through midwicket."
207,"Sehwag to Hussey, 1 run tossed up to end the over, driven to mid on and it is drinks."
208,"Jadeja to Hussey, FOUR runs boy, what a horrible ball. Drops it in his half, Hussey jumps back and thrashes him through square leg for another four."
209,"Jadeja to Hussey, no run better line, full on leg, worked straight to one of those two fielders."
210,"Jadeja to Hussey, 3 runs too straight now, DJ calmly flicks it down towards fine leg. Tendulkar runs back and saves the fourth run."
211,"Jadeja to Wade, FOUR runs but of course, short of a length wide of off stump. India have burnt the script and drowned the ashes. Wade stays back and opens the face to steer a four to third man., Easy as they come. MSD has a word with Jadeja."
212,"Jadeja to Wade, 1 run on the pads, Wade goes back and whips a single to square leg."
213,"Ashwin to Wade, 2 leg byes Ashwin's turn to bowl down the leg side now, and Wade gets some pad on it as it trickles down to fine leg for runs."

217,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run stops on Hussey from a length and he plays it back uppishly, but it lands well short of Ashwin."
218,"Ashwin to Hussey, no run good end to the over. Full ball on off stump, DJ looks to dab square but can't beat point."
219,"Praveen to Hussey, no run well done by PK on his follow through. Full length ball, pushed down the ground, and PK dives full length to his right to field it."
220,"Praveen to Hussey, 1 run too full, too straight and DJ trumpets it away through midwicket. He manages to find Ashwin inside the circle at midwicket."
221,"Praveen to Wade, 1 run on the pads, works it easily through square leg for another single."
222,"Praveen to Hussey, 1 run DJ jumps out, Praveen sees him and keeps it full and straight on leg stump. DJ has no room to work with, and pushes a quick single to mid-on."
223,"Praveen to Wade, no run yorker, effective even at 124.8 kph. Wade digs it out to the off side."
224,"Praveen to Wade, 1 run another full ball, driven to Ashwin in the covers, who takes a while releasing the ball to allow the single."
225,"Yadav to Wade, 2 runs length ball at pace on the pads, Wade flicks behind square for a couple. Not the best line to bowl with fine leg inside the circle."
226,"Yadav to Wade, OUT Yadav has a wicket! He can't believe his luck, he turns back and appeals after getting a healthy edge to the keeper. A bowler with pace makes a different straight away. Wade tries to open the face and steer a length ball behind square on the off side. Extra pace and bounce, forces the edge straight into Dhoni's mitts."
227,"Yadav to Christian, no run short of a length outside off, Christian stays on the crease and defends to the off side."
228,"Yadav to Christian, 1 run thick outside edge once again as Yadav hustles Christian with a fast ball outside off. It bounds down to third man."
229,"Yadav to Hussey, 1 run Intentional dab to third man from DJ, who uses Yadav's pace to pick another single. His fifty is up, it looks like he's got a 50 every time he's come out to bat in this series."
230,"Yadav to Christian, 1 wide ah, blown it. Too short, too wide and it is called. Christian tries to carve it over the off side, but misses."
231,"Yadav to Christian, 1 run ends this over with a good length ball on the pads, that Christian works square for a single."
232,"Jadeja to Christian, no run good length, and a tight line. Christian defends."
233,"Jadeja to Christian, no run fired in again, Christian looks to work to leg and gets some pad on it."
234,"Jadeja to Christian, no run another dot ball, full ball outside off that is played down the track."
235,"Jadeja to Christian, 1 leg bye huge lbw shout turned down. Christian was across the stumps and looking to nudge to leg, the ball struck him in front of leg, but it was sliding down."
236,"Jadeja to Hussey, 1 run tossed up to Hussey, who pushes a single into the covers."
237,"Jadeja to Christian, no run excellent finish from Jadeja, keeps Christian in the crease with a full ball that is blocked into the covers."
238,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run thrown up on the stumps, DJ works it through mid-on for a single."
239,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run full ball on leg stump, Christian drives now through long-on for one more."

241,"Ashwin to Christian, no run carrom ball lands outside leg and straightens, Christian ticles to the leg side."
242,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run flighted on the stumps, Christian drives to long-on for one. It goes through DJ at the non-striker's end, admittedly quite low. But Hussey jumps over to let it go. Doesn't use his hands. Just saying."
243,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run good finish from Ashwin too as Australia wind up for a bang. Back of a length on the stumps, whipped through midwicket for one. In three games against Australia in the CB series, Ashwin has 0 wickets."
244,"Yadav to Hussey, OUT Yadav is on a roll. He's brought India back into this game with a twin-strike. Bowling your fastest bowler seems to be a good idea after all. Short of a length, hustled by the pace, DJ goes for the pull but the ball is through him very quickly. Another edge, straight to Dhoni, even as DJ loses his grip on the bat.. Yadav smiles, this is the first bit of good news he's had in a long time."
245,"Yadav to McKay, 1 run short of a length outside off, dabbed behind point for a single."
246,"Yadav to Christian, no run short of a length on the stumps, Christian jabs it down the track."
247,"Yadav to Christian, FOUR runs another short ball, this time the batsman sees it and plays the pull shot early. He strong-arms the pull shot through midwicket for four. Good timing, it went in front of square."
248,"Yadav to Christian, no run tries the yorker this time, tails in to Christian who is late coming forward, but he keeps it out."
249,"Yadav to Christian, no run slower ball at 116 kph, Christian defends sedately."
250,"Sehwag to Lee, no run full ball on the stumps, Lee looks to sweep and is hit on the pad."
251,"Sehwag to Lee, 2 runs slipping down the leg. Lee slaps it round the corner, and Gambhir puts in the slide on the fine leg boundary and a relay throw to keep them to two."

253,"Sehwag to Lee, no run another dot ball, as Lee nudges with the spin straight to square leg."
254,"Sehwag to Lee, no run another superb over for India. Lee works a length ball straight to square leg."
255,"Yadav to Christian, no run full ball tailing in late, Christian digs it out down the ground and Yadav parries it away."
256,"Yadav to Christian, no run Australia are getting stuck now. Full length ball comes in towards the pads and Christian works it straight to Sehwag at midwicket."
257,"Yadav to Christian, 1 run slower ball at 113 kph, drops it fractionally short and Christian pulls. There's protection at deep midwicket, and it is one of the honorary members of the SCG."
258,"Yadav to Lee, no run back of a length outside off stump, Lee can't get any power on the square drive and it goes straight to point."
259,"Yadav to Lee, no run 136 kph on a lifting short ball that gave Lee absolutely no room. He tried to upper cut from beside his face, and made no contact."
260,"Yadav to Lee, 1 wide the slower ball goes down the leg side and is called a wide."
261,"Yadav to Lee, no run another big curve ball that comes in at pace. Lee can't get it away. Bright phase this for India."

263,"Sehwag to Lee, no run Lee leans out and works a full ball to mid-on."
264,"Sehwag to Lee, 1 run Gambhir is the one man having a wonky day. Length ball on the pads, worked behind square leg and Gambhir over-runs it but it doesn't cost a second."
265,"Sehwag to Christian, 1 run on the pads, tucked square for a single."
266,"Sehwag to Lee, no run pitches this one up, and Lee pushes it back down the track."
267,"Sehwag to Lee, no run Lee tries to sweep a full ball on the stumps, but it hits the pad. India appeal for the lbw, but it is not given. Pitched outside leg."
268,"Praveen to Wade, no run short of a length outside off from round the stumps. Steered to point."
269,"Praveen to Wade, no run back of a length again, Wade looks for the dab behind point but finds the fielder. Single denied once more."

271,"Praveen to Wade, 1 run short ball now, Wade sets up nicely and pulls hard, but there's protection in the deep."
272,"Praveen to Hussey, 1 run PK slips down the leg side and DJ glances down to fine leg. They want two, but Tendulkar has the strongest arm in this side. He fires in a howitzer throw, and Wade wisely abandons ideas of the second."
273,"Praveen to Wade, 1 run on the pads now, Wade whips and sprints for a single."
274,"Ashwin to Wade, no run back of a length, Wade tries to force to the leg side but can't get it away."
275,"Ashwin to Wade, SIX runs Ashwin's turn now to bowl an ugly long-hop and Wade has shredded it with a visceral pull over midwicket for six. That's his 50, and he's been allowed to play really well here."
276,"Ashwin to Wade, 1 run fuller length, pushed in front of square for one."
277,"Ashwin to Hussey, 1 run on the pads to DJ, who whips it into the midwicket for a single."
278,"Ashwin to Wade, no run fuller on the pads, Wade leans out and works it to the leg side."
279,"Ashwin to Wade, no run back of a length, Wade tries to nudge square but can't get the gap. Two dots to end another Ashwin over."
280,"Yadav to Christian, no run Yadav does extremely well to make that look like a chance. Christan blasts a length ball straight back down the track and Yadav gets his hands to it, but it doesn't stick. Thankfully, the fingers don't fall off."
281,"Yadav to Christian, 1 run short ball now, Christian bunts for a single."
282,"Yadav to Lee, 1 run slower ball to Lee, who laboriously drags it through wide mid-on for a single."
283,"Yadav to Christian, no run slow legspinner, stops and sleeps on Christian who hacks to the off side. Raina rumbles in to cut off the single."
284,"Yadav to Christian, FOUR runs yorker misses the mark by an inch or so, and at Yadav's pace that's all it takes. Christian flicks it expertly through midwicket and the ball disappears through to the ropes."
285,"Yadav to Christian, 1 leg bye that nipped in at pace, Christian couldn't get the bat on it and it goes off the pad to the off side for a leg bye."
286,"Sehwag to Christian, 1 run short ball, Christian pulls it hard but there's protection at deep midwicket, so he gets only one."
287,"Sehwag to Lee, no run flat and fast outside off, Lee goes back and hacks straight to Irfan in the off side. The momentum is gone."
288,"Sehwag to Lee, OUT and now Lee is gone. Having fired a couple through, Sehwag slows this one in the air and holds it back to hoodwink Lee as he charges out of the crease. He ends up swinging his swipe across the line, and the ball goes straight to Kohli at deep square leg."
289,"Sehwag to Christian, 1 run length ball on the pads, Dan C goes back and works a single behind square."
290,"Sehwag to Doherty, no run drift outside off stump, Doherty mistimes the cut to point."
291,"Sehwag to Doherty, no run another one curls in out of Sehwag's fingers. Doherty chops it listlessly to point. Boy, how fast the tables have turned since Yadav came back on!"
292,"Praveen to Christian, 1 run full and straight at the toes as Dan Christian chips out of the crease. Only a single available as the ball dribbles to the off side."
293,"Praveen to Doherty, no run full length ball squeezes past Doherty's outside edge as he tries to drive through the off side."
294,"Praveen to Doherty, 1 run super tight lines. Doherty advances and moves to the leg side as he does, and PK follows him. Straight on the boot, squeezed to the leg side for a single."
295,"Praveen to Christian, 1 run India somehow seem to have fielders everywhere now. Horror ball from PK, full toss down the leg side, and Christian manages to swing it straight to Irfan on the boundary behind square."
296,"Praveen to Doherty, 1 run full length to Doherty at 123 kph, he drills it into the ground and PK leaps to parry it to mid-off. Single taken."
297,"Praveen to Christian, 2 runs PK's lack of pace means Dan Christian's well-executed ramp shot doesn't go for four. 120 kph on a full length delivery outside off. Christian shuffles across and laps it over short fine leg and gets a couple as fine leg comes around to field."
298,"Sehwag to Doherty, 2 runs Full ball, tossed up outside off and Dohertly slogs laboriously to long-on for two."
299,"Sehwag to Doherty, 2 runs tossed up outside off, and sparks fly 20 yards from the cover fence where Kohli pulls off a magical save. He ran across fast to his left and dived full length to save a sure four."
300,"Sehwag to Doherty, SIX runs ah, the Sehwag magic is fading in the last over. Doherty goes down on a knee and heaves a length ball miles over the midwicket boundary."
301,"Sehwag to Doherty, 1 run over-pitches a slow and full ball well wide off off stump. Doherty carves it over the covers for one."
302,"Sehwag to Christian, 2 runs poor throw from Gambhir allows Christian to pinch a second. Length ball, he skipped out to slam it over the leg side, but mis-hit it through square leg. Gambhir ran in from the deep and his throw came through slowly, bounced twice and was a good two yards off the stumps. Christian was in by the time Dhoni could break the stumps."
303,"Sehwag to Christian, OUT another wicket for Sehwag. Australia have made only 47 in the last 10 overs, and that despite 13 runs coming in this over. Christian skipped out, got to the pitch and muscled this strongly down to long on, but he didn't have the elevation to clear the boundary. Well held in the deep, and there are smiles on the Indian faces as the trot off."
304,"A thoroughly engrossing session of play, with all the ebbs and flows that make ODI cricket fun to watch. Swing from Praveen to start off, early damage to Australia, followed by a tempered 50 from Warner. His dismissal was pivotal to the course of the game, as it put Irfan out of commission, even as it took Warner out of the equation. India had to bowl part-timers to make up the over-rate and Irfan's quota. That allowed Wade and DJ Hussey to settle"
305,"Dan Brettig has it all in his innings report. You guys read that, or Sid Monga's explanation of the DJ Hussey controversy, while I check out the entire transcript of the Dhoni presser chronicles. See you on the other side of the break."
306,"""MS Dhoni logs into FB account. 1 Notification. 'Sehwag and Dhoni are now friends'."" Thanks for the update, Sheedh."
307,"Sehwag is out there with the bat now, and he's there with Tendulkar. India's best opener in the series will bat at No. 3 again. Lee to bowl. Will Sehwag line up the upper-cut straight away? Two slips."
308,"Lee to Sehwag, 1 wide you almost saw that coming. Short and wide of off stump, Sehwag goes after it, but it was so wide that even he couldn't reach it. Third man is square, and is licking his lips."
309,"Lee to Sehwag, no run beaten outside off. Back of a length outside off, good carry and some away movement. Sehwag tries to jab it away, and misses."
310,"Lee to Sehwag, no run this time he lets one go outside off. 139 kph, short and lifting nicely outside off stump. Sehwag weaves away."
311,"Lee to Sehwag, no run beaten by a purler. Lee pitches this up on off stump and gets it to dance away from Sehwag as he fumbles to cover the line. Can't get closer to the outside edge, or the off stump, without making contact."
312,"Lee to Sehwag, no run rub your eyes in disbelief. Sehwag has shouldered arms to a back of length ball outside off stump. Ian Chappell says this is rare footage."
313,"Lee to Sehwag, 1 run here comes the carve over the off side, but Sehwag doesn't try to hit it out of the ground. It skims through to third man after a couple of bounces."
314,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run A short ball to Sachin first up, 141 kph and jumping away. Tendulkar stays out of harm's way."
315,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run short of a length outside Sehwag's off stump, he gets into a good position to steer to the off side."
316,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run superb bouncer from Hilfy, pitches it perfectly to trouble Sehwag as it goes close to his face. He was going back in the crease, but had to yank the head and bat away at the last moment."
317,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, FOUR runs thundered through the covers. Back of a length from Hilfenhaus, Sehwag had enough width to go back and thrash it on the up. He played it in the air, but found the gap in the covers."
318,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 wide slips down the leg side, Sehwag can't get the glance away and it is a wide."
319,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run short of a driving length. Sehwag goes back and punches to mid-off."
320,"Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run short of a length again, Sehwag stays back, feet stationary, and punches to the off side."
321,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run short of a length outside off stump and seaming away. Tendulkar shoulders arms."
322,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run another leave outside off from Tendulkar, he sees the short of length ball and lets it go."
323,"Lee to Tendulkar, 4 byes the ball somehow evades Wade. Good stuff from Lee, gets this to jump in off the seam as Tendulkar left, and then it started curling in sharply after passing the stumps. Wade didn't have a chance."
324,"Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run Sachin's away with an edged single through backward point as he looks to cover the line to a length ball outside off."
325,"Lee to Gambhir, 4 leg byes over-pitched on the pads, Gambhir misses the flick, but his pads deflect the ball to fine leg. Lee keeps appealing for an lbw, but that was sliding harmlessly down the leg side."
326,"Lee to Gambhir, 1 run back of a length on the stumps, Gambhir takes a quick single to mid-on to open his account."
327,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run short of a length on the off stump, the sort of ball Gambhir has routinely poked to the slips off the edge. He defends assuredly this time."
328,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run good bumper, only 136 kph but the perfect length. Gambhir ducks in a hurry."
329,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run back of a length and angling across. Gambhir hops and defends with an open face to the off side, before playing an air shot with a straighter bat"
330,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run fuller length outside off, Gambhir strokes it into the covers off the front foot."
331,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run presses forward and drives straight to mid-off now."
332,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run back of a length on the stumps, Gambhir defends staunchly down the track."
333,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run barring the one that went for four legbyes, Lee has bowled exclusively short. Sachin hops behind the line and defends to the off side."
334,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run zippy short ball at 140 kph, Sachin arches back and lets it go without a second thought."
335,"Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run direct hit would have had Gambhir gasping. Short of a length outside off, Sachin drops it to point and takes off. Hussey runs in and under-arms, but misses the stumps. Gambhir would have been gone."
336,"Lee to Gambhir, no run short of a length outside off, Gambhir sees it through to the keeper."
337,"Lee to Gambhir, no run Mike Hussey is on fire in the covers. He leaps and pounces to his left to parry a fluent cover drive from Gambhir."
338,"Lee to Gambhir, no run length ball at 142 kph to end the over, Gambhir defends solidly down the track."
339,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, FOUR runs Sachin pulls out the upper cut, and gets it away fine. I doubt if the fine-ness was entirely intentional. Hilf got this one to cut in from back of a length, and Sachin was cramped for room as he forced it away. It hit the edge of the top half of the bat."
340,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, 1 wide this one goes the other way, Sachin lets it go and it is a wide."
341,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run fuller length and nice shape away from the right hander. Tendulkar watches it go through."
342,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run another leave outside off, Sachin's looking determined to get them to bowl at him today."
343,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, FOUR runs blazing stroke through point. This was short and seaming away to give him the width. Sachin was hopping back even as he ripped at it with a cut shot of finesse and ferocity."
344,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run fuller and a touch wider of off stump, Tendulkar leaves it."
345,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, 3 runs and the off drive now. Doesn't overhit the over-pitched ball, just leans across towards the line and meets it with a perfect push of the straight bat. Beats mid-off and picks up three."
346,"Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run back of a length, Sachin stays back and steers backward of point for a single."
347,"Lee to Gambhir, 4 leg byes aha, Lee has burst a bumper right through Gambhir here. He was hopping and ducking, with the hands in front of his face and the eyes looking down as the ball took off from short of a length. The ball kisses the gloves and goes just past Wade as he leaps high and gets his glove-tips to it. Bowden signals legbyes. Gambhir was telling the umpire he gloved it. Pretty sure he wouldn't have, if Wade had held it."
348,"Lee to Gambhir, no run fuller length, Gambhir works it efficiently to mid-on."
349,"Lee to Gambhir, no run a subtle drop in pace, Gambhir is early into the front foot drive, but controls it and keeps it down towards mid-off."
350,"Lee to Gambhir, no run everyone gets away with something. Over-pitched on the pads, Gambhir works it straight to short fine leg, but nearly on the full. Forrest then hurls the stumps down needlessly at the bowler's end, but escapes without conceding overthrows."
351,"Lee to Gambhir, OUT this is going to get very nasty. Tendulkar is run out, but Lee was in his way as he ran through. Back of a length outside off stump, Gambhir drops it to point and Tendulkar responds for a single. Lee ran across the pitch towards the ball, and then stopped to observe as Warner ran in from point and under-armed it. Lee needn't have been there, but he was. And he wasn't there intentionally to block Tendulkar, but he did. Ten"
352,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 run short of a length outside off stump, Gambhir steers it through backward point for a single."
353,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, 2 runs Kohli is away with a princely tuck through midwicket as Hilfenhaus angles into his pads."
354,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run short of a length outside off, Kohli defends to the off side."
355,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run back of a length outside off stump, defended to the off side again."
356,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run pitched up and seaming into the pads, Kohli whips it straight to midwicket."
357,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, FOUR runs Kohli punches beautifully through the off side. Hilfenhaus pitched this up outside off, Kohli leaned out and stroked it without effort past mid-off for four."
358,"McKay to Gambhir, 1 run back of a length outside Gambhir's off stump, he plays it finer than point this time for the single."
359,"McKay to Kohli, 2 runs full ball, angling into the pads and Kohli flicks languidly through backward square leg for a couple."
360,"McKay to Kohli, (no ball) lets a length ball go through outside off as it hits the seam and darts in close to the stumps ... No-ball, free hit to come."
361,"McKay to Kohli, FOUR runs Kohli's carted the freebie for four. Short ball angling into the batsman's body isn't a good idea when you are bowling a free hit. Kohli cashes in, pivoting on his back foot and rolling the wrists to send it packing through midwicket."
362,"McKay to Kohli, no run another one darts in off the seam, and Kohli lets it pass outside off stump."
363,"McKay to Kohli, no run Kohli leans across and drives to mid-off off the middle of the bat."
364,"McKay to Kohli, no run jaffa to end the over, beats Kohli with one that hits the seam outside off stump and swerves away. Kohli pushes forward and feels for it."
365,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run short of a length on the stumps, worked off the hips to the leg side."
366,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 wide bouncer over the leg stump line, Gambhir tries to swat it away and misses."
367,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run they are saving fours for a living, are the Husseys. David now at short cover, holds a bullet as Gambhir leans out and drives hard into the off side."
368,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 wide slips this one well down the leg side and it is called a wide."
369,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run Hilfenhaus gets the ball to seam in, Gambhir inner edges a drive onto the pads."
370,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run another dot ball as Gambhir opens the face and steers a full ball straight to point."
371,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, FOUR runs Gambhir produces some top-class timing with the cut shot. Back of a length outside off, not that wide, but it was enough for Gambhir to latch onto with a cut behind point."
372,"Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, FOUR runs ah, Hilfy has lost the plot a touch. Full toss wide of off stump now, and Gambhir was almost apologetic to lean across and flash it through the point area. Two fours and two wides ruin the over."
373,"McKay to Kohli, no run short of a length outside off from McKay, Kohli blocks to point."
374,"McKay to Kohli, no run fuller length, again that proud forward press from Kohli who punches hard to mid-off."
375,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run clipped uppishly, but Kohli had that gap at midwicket in his sights as the full ball tails into him. McKay goes down on his follow through, some footing problems for the Aussie seames."
376,"McKay to Gambhir, no run on Gambhir's pads, he works it neatly straight to midwicket."
377,"McKay to Gambhir, no run full ball on off stump, Gambhir defends off the front foot to mid-off"
378,"McKay to Gambhir, no run Gambhir plays across the line to a full ball, and inside edges onto the pad. It carries a fair way to the leg side too, but drops short of the fielder."

380,"Hussey to Kohli, 1 run this time Kohli uses the wrists to turn it behind square for a single."
381,"Hussey to Gambhir, 1 run back of a length on the stumps, Gambhir nudges it to the leg side."
382,"Hussey to Kohli, 1 run short ball on the stumps, Kohli turns it with the spin for one more."
383,"Hussey to Gambhir, no run fuller, straightens from off stump line. Gambhir doesn't get too far forward but defends."
384,"Hussey to Gambhir, 1 run short ball on the pads, turned to square leg for one more."
385,"McKay to Gambhir, 1 run pitched up outside off, Gambhir leans out and guides it into the covers for a single."
386,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on the pads, worked through square leg for one."
387,"McKay to Gambhir, no run angled across at 132 kph, Gambhir shoulders arms."

389,"McKay to Gambhir, no run pitched further up, Gambhir digs it out straight to mid off."
390,"McKay to Gambhir, FOUR runs edged but safe. Gambhir drawn out by a full length ball that was angling across. He gets the outside edge and it flies to the left of slip. It was dying on him too. Watson was the man at lone slip, and he was making a good effort."

410,"McKay to Gambhir, no run angled across Gambhir once again, and he lets it go to the keeper."
411,"McKay to Gambhir, 1 run several run out chances there, but all safe. Gambhir drilled a full ball back, McKay got a finger on it and it hit the stumps, but Raina was in. Gambhir then wanted the single, and Raina responded eventually and bounded in, in time."

421,"Lee to Dhoni, no run another bumper outside off stump, Dhoni watches it closely as it goes to keeper."
422,"Lee to Dhoni, no run Dhoni didn't know which way to go there. 138 kph on a full ball outside off that then seamed away. Dhoni should have gone back and across, but he did neither and was beaten."

424,"Lee to Dhoni, no run again on the back foot, but this time Dhoni potters across to cover the line and defends to the off side."

441,"Watson to Dhoni, no run short ball outside off, another maiden from Watson to Dhoni as he punches into the covers."

443,"McKay to Dhoni, no run on a length, Dhoni defends from the crease."
444,"McKay to Dhoni, no run Dhoni dropped in the slips. Watson is the culprit again, and the ball seems to be following him. This one hit the seam and straightened outside off as Dhoni went at it with hard hands. It was dying on Watson, but if he'd held, that would have been the game."

447,"McKay to Jadeja, no run angled across Jadeja from over the stumps and he lets it go."
448,"Watson to Dhoni, no run Christian is like a wall in the covers.. Nothing's going past him. Dhoni absolutely murders a length ball to short cover, and Christian puts out his left hand to stop it."
449,"Watson to Dhoni, no run eight saved off two balls. Over-pitched outside off, Dhoni lashes the off drive, but Hilfenhaus moves quickly and slides to his right to stop it."
450,"Watson to Dhoni, 2 runs over-pitched this time on the pads, and Dhoni flicks to deep square leg. They could have had three, but Dhoni stops Jadeja as McKay's relay throw comes in. First runs off Watto after 18 balls."
451,"Watson to Dhoni, no run again he drives into the covers and Christian intercepts."
452,"Watson to Dhoni, no run action replay. Full pitched outside off, Dhoni drives fluently to Christian in the covers."

480,"Christian to Dhoni, 1 run Dhoni punches a single to deep cover from the crease. He now has 10 off 38 balls."
481,"Christian to Ashwin, 2 runs top timing from Ashwin, but some sluggish running. Angled into the pads, Ashwin whips it sumptuously to square leg. Hilfenhaus slid and cleaned up in the deep, and India didn't show enough intent for the third."

502,"Hilfenhaus to Ashwin, no run back of a length from Hilf, Ashwin defends from the crease."
503,"Hilfenhaus to Ashwin, FOUR runs steered intentionally, but it went uncomfortably close to the fly slip. Short and wide of off stump, Ashwin delicately opened the face to glide it fine, and Watson went flying to his right at slip, but this was out of his range."

538,"Lee to Pathan, SIX runs Irfan is summoning his inner Ganguly now. He's smoked Lee over long-on for a monster six. Good juicy length ball, Irfan leaned out and banged it through the line with a straight bat. That was thumped, Praveen was taking cover the moment Irfan made contact."

548,"The wheels have come off this Indian team. MS Dhoni and Duncan Fletcher will be looking at the last couple of weeks and wondering how they managed to spiral to such ignominious lows after delivering that nerve-shredding tie against Sri Lanka. At that point, SL were without a win in the tournament. Since then, India have been as abject as Sri lanka have been good."
549,"As always, India fans have some scraps of hope to hold onto. If India win with a bonus point on Tuesday, and if Australia beat Sri Lanka in the last league game (make those big IFs, with salad dressing on top), India can still sneak into the final. At the moment, they don't deserve to. A win without a bonus point in Hobart won't do for India. They will then end up on 14 points, and Sri Lanka already have 15."
550,"Right then, that completes our live coverage of this game. Here is Dan Brettig's report of the day's play. We'll soon have plenty of analysis and opinion from Sid Monga in Sydney. I'll be back on Tuesday to bring you India's last league game, perhaps India's last game on this disastrous tour. Sri Lanka will start off as favourites, and will only need to deny the bonus point to confirm their spot in the finals. Until Tuesday, on behalf of the ESPNc"
