31,"Flintoff to Ponting, 2 runs high high - very high - and Lewis at mid-on waited an age and made a complete hash of it. It was right down his throat and he seemed far too casual, it bounced out of his hands and he couldn't grab the rebound. Numpty, as Mr Miller loves to say"

60,"Dalrymple to Hussey, 1 run tossed up again, swept single to the man on the 45"
61,"Dalrymple to Ponting, SIX runs checked drive, no follow through at all, and it still has enough legs to go over the head of long-off"

70,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs good start, pushed off the legs to a wide long-on"

108,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 leg bye slower ball, strays down leg and Symonds can only get a leg on it as it goes to the man up at fine leg"
109,"PD Collingwood to White, SIX runs clattered over midwicket and Dalrymple has a one-handed attempt to leap up and get that but it goes over him and just clears the rope.

121,Martin will be back to take you through the next ten overs.
122,"Now let's see if Australia's bowlers can wipe the smile off his face though - their batsmen certainly had a good go. If this is any consolation at all for England, Australia's total isn't a record for all Twenty20 matches ... Somerset made 250 in 2006."
123,"England didn't help themselves with some average fielding at times, including two gaffesque drops. Vaughan's return as captain, though, was strangely encouraging - he was upbeat and seemed to be enjoying himself out there and his field placements were decent - for what they were worth, Australia often"

150,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run, OUT turned behind square on the off, Pietersen calls for a second and Harwood scores a direct hit to leave him a foot short ... had he not hit then Pietersen would have made it. The Australians think they have their man straight away - plenty of high tens - and the t"
