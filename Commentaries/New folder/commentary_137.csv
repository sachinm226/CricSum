0,"10.15am Drama is not usually far away when these sides meet, of all variety! Here are five of the best contests between Australia and South Africa drawn up by Liam Brickhill."
1,"South Africa lost their warm-up match against the PM's XI in Canberra, but have been ticking over nicely in one-day cricket of late with an away series win in Sri Lanka and a home cleansweep against Zimbabwe. However, they still have some questions to answer before the World Cup. One man firmly back in the frame is Dale Steyn. But former captain Graeme S"
2,"10.30am Australia's ODI form was dire before all the problems struck. They have been poor for almost two years now and look a long way of being to defend their World Cup title. But they do have some guns back with the ball for this series, although need much more from their batsmen as well."
3,"10.40am Ten minutes until the toss. We know that Marsh is out and Short is in. What will the balance of Australia's attack be? The fast bowling of both sides should be a feature of this series: Starc, Cummins, Hazlewood, Steyn, Rabada, Ngidi. Tasty."
4,"South Africa Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram, Reeza Hendricks, Faf du Plessis, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Imran Tahir"
5,"Australia Aaron Finch, Travis Head, D'arcy Short, Chris Lynn, Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood"
6,"Finch says he would have bowled first as well, but he's not too disappointed. He doesn't think the pitch will change"
7,South Africa have certainly battled trying to replace Jacques Kallis in both ODI and Test cricket. As any side would with a player of such incredible value. He was one of a kind and virtually three cricketers in one.
8,11.00am So a lot of fast bowling on both sides. No specialist spinner for Australia and an interesting batting order. Klaasen and Phehlukwayo didn't play the warm-up game for South Africa.
9,"The Australia selectors, Justin Langer and Greg Chappell, were understood to be set to pick Zampa and leave Cummins out. But the expected pace and bounce in the wicket changed their minds. Aaron Finch said at the toss they liked the way D'Arcy Short bowled in the T20 series in the UAE and they were comfortable to rely on his left-arm wrist spin as the al"
10,He hasn't played an ODI since February. He didn't play against either Sri Lanka or Zimbabwe and played domestic cricket in October instead.
11,11.10am The players are coming out for the anthems.
12,11.18am We're almost ready for the first ball. Travis Head and Aaron Finch are out there. Head will face the first ball from Dale Steyn. Two slips in.

27,"Steyn to Head, OUT edged and caught behind! This was almost a half-volley, across the left-hander, Head's feet were stuck in cement on the crease as threw the hands at a drive and got a thin edge through to de Kock and he gleefully accepts the simple catch. Great start for the great Dale Steyn."
28,"Steyn to Short, no run 142kph, back of a length across the left hander and he leaves awkwardly as it flees to the keeper"
29,"Steyn to Short, OUT edged and what a catch by du Plessis at second slip! Another full ball across the left hander, he launches into a drive, again not a big forward stride, thick edge, flies high to the skipper's left and he jumps and takes a superb catch flying up with two hands above his left shoulder! Great bowling and catching from South Africa"
30,"Steyn to Lynn, 2 runs onto the pads, 138kph, he clips this away nicely through midwicket, timed well enough to get a couple"
31,"Ngidi to Finch, no run 137kph, wide of the crease, back of a length, angling back into the right hander, he shoulders arms and it flies through to the keeper"

40,"Steyn to Lynn, no run 138kph, beats him with a cracking outswinger! Wow, what a delivery, good length, swings away, he fends and misses."
41,"Steyn to Lynn, no run 138kph, similar line and length and Lynn wisely lets it go outside off"

46,"Ngidi to Finch, no run 139kph, booming attempted drive and miss from Finch. This was wide but not a half-volley, extra bounce flies past the flashing blade"
47,"Ngidi to Finch, OUT LBW! Finch walks off. No review! This was a good length wide of off, nipped back sharply and hits above the knee roll, and Aleem Dar gives it! He was on his toes on the crease. There is a lot of bounce in this track. Hawkeye had it going over the stumps! How did they not review that! There has been a lot of pace and bounce. That"
48,"Ngidi to Carey, no run 138kph, short into the hip and he defends into midwicket"
49,"Steyn to Lynn, no run beaten again sparring outside off! Another pure outswinger that zips away past the edge"

59,"Rabada to Lynn, no run back of a length outside off, he's defending and it hits the sticker of the bat hard"
60,"Rabada to Lynn, 2 runs 139kph full toss, into middle and he works this cautiously wide of mid but times it well enough for a couple"

109,"Phehlukwayo to Lynn, no run full at off stump from over the wicket, defended to mid-off"
110,"Phehlukwayo to Lynn, OUT another one goes! Appeal for caught behind, given not out and South Africa review straightaway. It sounded like a bottom edge. A delivery with some width, Lynn went after it, and there's a clear noise as the ball passes the bat. There's also a spike on Snicko. Lynn is almost off the field...he's basically walked! Umpire sa"
111,"Phehlukwayo to Maxwell, FOUR runs off the mark first ball with a boundary, but good job he hit that! Walked right across his stumps to a length delivery and tickles it to fine leg"

113,"Phehlukwayo to Carey, no run round the wicket, good length at off stump, Carey defends coming forward"

117,"Ngidi to Carey, 1 run round the wicket, short outside off, cut hard square of the wicket and there's an excellent stop by Markram as he dives at point. The throw at the non-striker's stumps clips one of the zing bails and it doesn't fall off! (Batsman was well home)"
118,"Ngidi to Maxwell, FOUR runs touch too full this time and put away straight down the ground with a lovely straight drive"
119,"Ngidi to Maxwell, no run full at the stumps, strongly punched to mid-off"
120,"Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run ouch! That has spat at Maxwell from short of a length and hammered his bottom thumb. He's in some pain here. Vicious delivery"
121,"Phehlukwayo to Maxwell, OUT caught at mid-on! It goes from bad to worse for Australia, although Maxwell is standing his ground to see if it's carried. He came forward into a drive, a bit early on it, couldn't keep the ball down. It's dripping on the way Klaasen. Soft signal was out, and third umpire says he's happy the fingers are under the ball"
122,"Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, 1 wide slips this down the leg side and it's called wide"
123,"Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, no run been given caught behind, a wonderful diving catch from de Kock but Stoinis has reviewed. It's been given for the catch, rather than lbw the umpire says. That appears quite a long way from the inside edge as it nips back off the seam, and is outside the line for lbw. So he'll survive. Not a great on-field decision th"
124,"Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, 2 runs full, slips into the pads, clipped off his toes through square leg...Australia reach fifty"

139,"Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, 2 runs width outside off, carved through point and good running makes it a second"
140,"Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, OUT oh dear! What was that?! Stoinis has just clubbed it to mid-on. A length ball, he tried to drive through the line, didn't even look as though he was trying to keep it down. Simple catch"
