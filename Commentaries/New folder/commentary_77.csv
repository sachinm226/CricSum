Cottrell circles around running 20 yards left but takes a very poor angle and is on the verge of over-running the chance.

234,"Russell to Coulter-Nile, no run An LBW appeal but he might have got an inside edge. Not out is the call. It was angling down and might have been too high"

278,"Nurse to Coulter-Nile, 1 run dropped! Hetmyer shells it! Quicker ball lands short on middle, flat pull by Coulter-Nile didn't get the elevation to clear Hetmyer at deep midwicket. He comes in 12 yards from the rope and slides on his knees to cushion the take but it ricochets out. His body wasn't balanced as well as it could've been."

284,"Thomas to Smith, FOUR runs full outside off, lofted drive over wide mid-off. Elegant!"
285,"Thomas to Smith, OUT Cottrell with a screamer! No turf trolls eating him up this time at long leg! Fullish length on a fifth stump line. Smith shuffles across once more to flick this high over backward square, Cottrell made an absolute mess of a chance on 26 in an identical slot, this time sprints along the rope 20 yards moving left at full speed and stabs at it with his left hand, knifing it out of the air, then flicks it up before stepping over the rope before reclaiming it after reestablishing himself inside the field of"
286,"Thomas to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide wide yorker, too wide to play at."

293,"Cottrell to Cummins, 1 run fullish length angled into off stump, chopped off the back foot to third man."
294,"Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs dropped! Very harsh but it did ricochet off Brathwaite's hand at deep square leg and then hit the rope on the full for six. Shortish length on off stump, Coulter-Nile laces a scorching pull toward Brathwaite at deep square leg, just evades his grasp running to his left and sliding at the last moment. After the take that Cottrell just had in the previous over, the fans and teammate's must be wondering why Brathwaite couldn't match him! But it was 10/10 on the degree of difficulty scale."
295,"Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs highest score now by a No. 8 in a World Cup! In the slot outside off, drives through the line 15 yards into the stands over long-on."
296,"Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, 1 run short outside off, slapped to long-off."
297,"Cottrell to Cummins, 1 run fullish length outside off, pushed to extra cover, good stop by Nurse moving left to keep it to one."
298,"Brathwaite to Cummins, OUT slower bouncer, Cummins struggles keeping his hands back going to pull, skies it to deep square leg, Cottrell settles under it 10 yards in from the rope. This was 3/10 on the difficulty scale compared to the absurd one-hander he took to dismiss Smith."
299,"Brathwaite to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs full and very wide, dips the back knee to get under this and carve it over extra cover. Exquisite."

305,"Thomas to Coulter-Nile, no run full and wide, thick edge driving but it doesn't carry to Hope."
306,"Thomas to Coulter-Nile, 1 run another wide yorker, dug out off the toe to long-off. Coulter-Nile checks the toe of his bat to see if it has 10 more runs in it to take him to a maiden ODI ton."
307,"Thomas to Starc, no run short on the body, goes to pull, off the glove before bouncing short of Hope. Does well to save four."
308,"Thomas to Starc, 2 runs very full on the legs, clipped behind square, relay comes in from long leg running right."
309,"Thomas to Starc, 2 runs full and wide, driven in the air toward Hetmyer at mid-off, he dives right to knock it down but not cleanly enough to prevent a second run. It means Coulter-Nile will be on strike for the next over."
310,"Brathwaite to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs full and wide, Coulter-Nile misses a drive, but Hope fumbles the take. Universe Boss makes a galaxy sprint from short third man to relay back in. He's holding his left hammy now. Given as runs by the umpire instead of byes."
311,"Brathwaite to Coulter-Nile, OUT Coulter-Nile falls four short of breaking the record for a No. 8 in ODIs! It was in the slot outside off, he went for glory trying to clear Holder at wide long-off but got under it just a bit too much. The bat turned on connection too so wasn't timed as well as he wanted. In the air for awhile before coming down to the West Indies captain three yards inside the rope."
312,"Brathwaite to Starc, no run slower bouncer, Starc is early trying to pull at 78 mph."
313,"Brathwaite to Starc, FOUR runs another short ball, this time Starc crunches it sweet through midwicket."
314,"Brathwaite to Starc, no run bouncer on the body, late hooking. No wide called on the line down leg. Ball passed over leg stump."
315,"Brathwaite to Starc, OUT Brathwaite rewarded for pitching it up again, in the slot on off, Starc tried to heave it over Holder at wide long-on but didn't get under it enough and the tallest man on the field has no issues claiming this one roving left a few yards inside the rope at chest height."
316,"In spite of that earlier misjudged chance by Cottrell, he made up for it later with this stunner to finally claim Smith at deep fine leg. Watch Sheldon Cottrell's sensational catch on the boundary. It came after Smith and Alex Carey initially led Australia's fightback to dig out of a major hole at 79 for 5. Watch how Smith and Carey put Australia back in the game (UK, IRE, AUS only)."
317,"2.18 pm Australia end an over short, but a brilliant fightback nonetheless led by Smith and Coulter-Nile. West Indies paid for some inconsistent fielding though. Smith arguably should have been caught at deep fine leg on 26 but Cottrell misjudged the chance and Coulter-Nile was also grassed on a much simpler effort by Hetmyer on 61 at deep midwicket. The wides were also costly too, releasing the pressure after West Indies had Australia under the pump. Can West Indies chase this down? See what our MatchDay studio panel has to say."
318,Gayle and Lewis walk out to open the chase. Starc over the stumps to Gayle with two slips in place.
319,"West Indies were favorites on the UK high street oddsmakers from the fifth wicket through the majority of the rest of the innings, but that Coulter-Nile rearguard has put Australia at 4/5 at the start of this chase to defend 288, for people into that kind of thing...."

330,"Cummins to Hope, no run full on the legs, whipped straight to Coulter-Nile at midwicket. Gimme ball and couldn't put it away."
331,"Cummins to Hope, no run stays low and nearly bowled! Good length ball pitching on about fifth stump and angled in, Hope goes back and it doesn't bounce as much as he thought it would at 86 mph, the ball coos into the ear of off stump. No kissing though..."
332,"Starc to Gayle, no run good length on off, defended to cover."
333,"Starc to Gayle, no run nearly a catch! Short and wide, Gayle rocks back to cut, it was in the air for awhile, but Stoinis is a bit too square at cover for the chance, he dives right to knock it down at the very least on the short hop."
334,"Starc to Gayle, no run short outside off on fourth stump, Gayle goes to pull and plays over the top of it."
335,"Starc to Gayle, FOUR runs another one clips the edge but goes safe over Carey! Rip-snorter from Starc! Short ball angled into the body from off stump, Gayle tries to get the hands behind it on the back foot and it climbs sharply , clips the shoulder of the bat and takes off over Carey's leaping effort to the rope."
336,"Starc to Gayle, no run given out but Gayle reviews immediately! Fullish length on fourth stump angled in, Gayle is late driving as there was a definite noise when it passed the stumps... because the ball has in fact shaved off stump. A little peck! The baby smooch! Not a full pucker to dislodge the bails though. Incredible!"
337,"Starc to Gayle, 1 wide short and wide outside off, too wide to play."
338,"Starc to Gayle, no run yorker nails Gayle on the toes and he's given out but Gayle challenges umpire Chris Gaffaney's judgment once more with a review! It was tailing in and hits him on the front pad ricocheting to the back foot, initial impact was showing it was tailing down leg. Sure enough ball-tracking shows the impact was outside leg stump and continuing to go down. Gayle survives again."
339,"Cummins to Hope, no run good length ball defended to point."
340,"Cummins to Hope, 1 run fullish length on middle, clipped to long leg."

348,"Starc to Hope, 1 run full on the legs, clipped to long leg."
349,"Starc to Gayle, 2 runs yorker on leg stump, stabbed out behind square and they come back for an easy pair as deep square leg who was quite fine circles around to relay it in."
350,"Starc to Gayle, OUT stone dead this time around! Starc couldn't pierce Gayle with the yorker on the previous ball but this time around Gayle is late getting the bat down on an 86 mph delivery pitching very full and hitting him low on the shin in front of middle. After waiting 12 seconds while chatting with Hope, Gayle finally calls for the review.... Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg-stump on umpire's call. Three strikes (on DRS) and you're out! West Indies retain their review though."

391,"Maxwell to Hope, 1 run full on the legs, clipped through square leg."

555,"Starc to Russell, OUT Russell's fiery cameo ended by Starc! And a brilliant take by Maxwell too! Russell continues backing away from leg stump for a mow over midwicket, Starc targets leg stump and Russell gets a leading edge skier over point. Maxwell runs out from the circle taking this over the shoulder a third of the way to the rope. Sensational grab, 8/10 on degree of difficulty but it was bog standard for Maxwell. Whatever Holder said to Russell at the start of the over to have him rein in his aggression failed to produ"
