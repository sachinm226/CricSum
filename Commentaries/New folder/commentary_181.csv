122,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run how can a team display such good awareness one ball and then not even try the second run next ball? Raina was happy to sacrifice his wicket on the fifth ball of the over, but on the last ball - and this is a criticism of perhaps every team in the world - batsmen don't risk hurting their average. This is hit to Maxwell at long-on again, Maxwell has had to collect it with his left hand, but India"
123,"That pet peeve for not running that extra run put side, India seem to have done well especially after the ball moved around and beat the bat early on. There are three bowlers who have gone for under eight an over, but India have cashed in on the others. Shilkhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli all crossed 40 and scored at a quick rate. Do they have enough? In Adelaide 187 was enough. What happens at MCG will soon be"

207,"Yuvraj to Watson, 1 run on a length, middle and leg, driven to long-on"
208,"Yuvraj to Finch, 2 runs full, middle and leg, bunted into the leg side for a two. Jadeja is quick and surprises them a little, but the batsmen make it eventually"
209,"Jadeja to Watson, 2 runs he has Malinaged this round arm. Would have been a wide had Watson not swept this hard and in the air towards Yadav at deep square leg. Yadav goes for the catch, but it reaches him on the half-volley. He has got his body behind it, and keeps them down to just two. This is good fielding"
210,"Jadeja to Watson, OUT if Yadav's fielding last ball was good, this is nothing short of sensational. Watson has absolutely drilled this right back at the umpire's head. All eyes on the ducking umpire and the boundary but Jadeja gets both his hands in the air and takes this fuss free. It takes a brave man and an excellent fielder. Jadeja is both. Watson is impressed with Jadeja's effort. He is bemused but he is impr"

213,"Jadeja to Wade, 1 run another single down the ground"
214,"Jadeja to Finch, no run another roundarm delivery. This is shortish, quick and outside off, Finch makes room, and then leaves it alone. Perhaps not short enough to be cutting"

216,"Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 run dropped into the leg side for a single. Wade is in trouble, but Yuvraj has got himself into a tangle and lets him take the single"

218,"Ashwin to Faulkner, no run flatter delivery, Faulkner looks to go behind square on the off side, and is beaten by the skidding delivery"
219,"Ashwin to Faulkner, no run Ashwin dives to his right, and as he gets a bad bounce, he bunts it towards short midwicket. Saves one run, and also keeps Wade on strike"

222,"Jadeja to Wade, 1 run this is a wide down the leg side until Wade sweeps it straight to short fine leg for a single"
223,"Jadeja to Faulkner, SIX runs Faulkner flickers. Takes a flat length ball from outside off and slogs it over midwicket for a six. They will need five more such hits if they are to win, though"
224,"Jadeja to Faulkner, 2 runs this will do for Australia. Full and straight, nearly a yorker, and off the inside edge it goes for a couple"
225,"Jadeja to Faulkner, OUT a freak stumping to make up for the one he missed earlier in the evening? Wide round-arm delivery, Faulkner looks for the big slog, inside-edges it into Dhoni's pads, and the ricochet goes on to the stumps. The third umpire is brought in, and the replay from square on shows his back foot has dragged out of the crease. Dhoni's gloves are close to the stumps when the ball hits the wicket, but"

229,"Ashwin to Wade, SIX runs down the wicket tp chip this length ball over midwicket for a six. Too late? Too little?"
230,"Ashwin to Wade, no run cleverly bowled by Ashwin. Sees Wade back away and bowls a quick one just inside the tram line. The little Wade can't reach it. Is beaten"
231,"Ashwin to Wade, no run same line wide outside off but this time slower in the air. Wade just toe-ends this back to Ashwin"
232,"Nehra to Hastings, 1 run full and wide, driven to long-on for one"
233,"Nehra to Wade, 1 run yorker, on off, dug out for a single to extra cover"
