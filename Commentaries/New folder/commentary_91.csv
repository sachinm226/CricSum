0,6.40pm Pakistan won the toss and bat (after a little bit of confusion) and have named an unchanged XI
1,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run starts with a full toss! It's straight, pushed to the on side"
2,"Starc to Babar Azam, 1 run short, some width outside off, he drives off the back foot and it flies in the air wide of backward point to third man"
3,"Starc to Zaman, no run almost a run out! Was full and straight, off the pad into the leg side, Azam wanted the run and has to turn around quickly. The dive would have just saved him"
4,"Starc to Zaman, no run tucked off the pads to square leg"
5,"Starc to Zaman, 2 runs back of a length outside off, angled wide of backward point to third man and there's good running to make the second"
6,"Starc to Zaman, no run a strangled appeal for a catch down the leg side, was speared in at leg stump, just glances the pad through to Carey. Starc searching for early swing"
7,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs lovely shot, full outside off, into position and drives elegantly wide of mid-off...perfect timing"
8,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs that's even better! Richardson dragged the length back, Azam punches it through the covers off the back foot. The outfield is rapid!"
9,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, no run banged in back of a length, nips back and takes an inside edge into the pads"
10,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, 2 runs short of a length, straight, whipped through midwicket"
11,"Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, 1 run short outside off, he crunches a pull but picks out short midwicket who parries it away"
12,"Kane Richardson to Zaman, no run full outside off, not much footwork as he drives square to point"
13,"Starc to Babar Azam, FOUR runs and again! That's a cracker. Short of a length outside off, stand and deliver from Azam as he stands tall and drives through the covers"
14,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run that's timed nicely as well, driven square but this time picks out cover"
15,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run short outside off, driven from the back foot and finds short cover who has just been moved into position"
16,"Starc to Babar Azam, FOUR runs that's another brilliant stroke, he's flying, as Starc drops short on his hip and it's a whip-pull to deep square leg"
17,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run there's the yorker, at off stump, dug out to point and that just shaped back a fraction"
18,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run short of a length outside off, square drives to point and Azam lets out a scream that he didn't find the gap. It's coming off the middle so far"
19,"Cummins to Zaman, no run over the wicket, full at the stumps, 137kph, defended to the bowler"
20,"Cummins to Zaman, OUT finds mid-off! So another failure for Zaman as he tries to get going. Stayed leg-side of a full delivery, sliced across the delivery, sends a pretty straightforward catch to Warner"

29,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, 2 runs full outside off, Sohail drives high over cover, not perfectly timed but it's wide of the sweeper"
30,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, OUT he's done it again! Another ugly swipe sees the downfall of Sohail. Back of a length, he swings to the leg side, takes a big top edge and Richardson settles under the simple catch"
31,"Cummins to Babar Azam, 1 run full at off stump, push and run towards mid-on...tight, but think he was safe. Takes him off strike again"

44,"Agar to Rizwan, 1 run full at leg stump, flicked off the toes to deep square"
45,"Agar to Babar Azam, 1 run tucked round the corner to short fine leg"
46,"Agar to Rizwan, 1 run there he goes! Skips down the pitch and drives inside out over cover, but long-off keeps it to a single"

56,"Agar to Babar Azam, FOUR runs short on the pads, paddles this wide of short fine leg...doesn't quite get hauled back in by McDermott running from deep square. He actually got there, but flicked it into himself"

58,"Agar to Babar Azam, 1 run short of a length, worked to long-on"

239,Australia win by seven wickets with nine balls to spare. That was a clinic from Steve Smith. That's why he's in this team. Nervy chases when they lose early wickets are his bread and butter. He took control and picked Pakistan apart. He didn't get much help but he didn't need it. Pakistan lost this with the bat in reality as 150 was nowhere near enough.
240,"That's it from Canberra. Smith too good and Australia go 1-0 up. Both sides head to Perth for the final match of the series on Friday at Perth Stadium. On behalf of our team, hope you can join us then."
241,Australia won by 7 wickets (with 9 balls remaining)
242,"Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS"
