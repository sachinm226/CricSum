,Data
0,"Anderson to Watson, no run what a leave! That didn't pitch too far outside off and swung in, Watson raised his bat out of the way to leave but that really didn't miss the off stump by much"
1,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run this one goes the other way, squirting off the outer half of the bat down to third man, and Watto's away"
2,"Anderson to Paine, no run seems a good pitch this, good carry through to the keeper. Nice wheels from Anderson too, as Paine raises his bat up and watches one go by outside off"
3,"Anderson to Paine, no run dead on target, zoning in on off stump, and Paine is forward and right behind it to defend. Good pace again from Anderson"
4,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run just too straight this time, and Paine works one off his pads down to fine leg"
5,"Anderson to Watson, no run good ball to finish the over, full and straight. Watson defends, and that's a good, tight first over from Anderson"
6,"Bresnan to Paine, no run there's the Bresnan we got to know in Bangladesh this winter, bang on target on off stump straight away and giving the batsman nothing"
7,"Bresnan to Paine, no run spits off a length! Paine is struck on the glove and immediately pulls it off the bat. That must've hurt. Good ball on a length on off stump, just reared up at him"
8,"Bresnan to Paine, no run metronomic from Bresnan so far, on a length on off and defended"
9,"Bresnan to Paine, no run ah, Paine's lost his trust for this wicket. This was an identical ball to the last, on a length on off, but he didn't trust the bounce and defended awkwardly"
10,"Bresnan to Paine, no run a touch straighter, pushed to midwicket but no run"
11,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run flashing drive from Watson, but it's well cut off by a diving Eoin Morgan at cover - he's saved runs there"
12,"Anderson to Paine, no run on a length and slightly wide of off. Not wide enough for a cut, though, and Paine leaves well alone"
13,"Anderson to Paine, no run identical ball to the last, and Paine reacts with a confident leave once again"
14,"Anderson to Paine, 2 runs shorter this time, and Paine swivels quickly into a pull. He went aerial but really didn't get a good connection on that, the ball lobs over midwicket though"
15,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run on a length outside off, and Paine runs the ball of the face of the bat down to third man"
16,"Anderson to Watson, no run fuller, wider, and left alone"
17,"Bresnan to Paine, 2 runs first hint of width from Bresnan, and he's cut away towards point. The ball was hit very hard into the ground and bounced up and over the fielder there"
18,"Bresnan to Paine, no run fuller, and driven firmly into the covers"
19,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs first boundary, and it's a good one! Bresnan fired one down full and straight and Paine presented the full face of the bat to drive down the ground. He hit the ball in the air, but firmly and dead straight, so not really any chance for the caught-and-bowled"
20,"Bresnan to Paine, no run Bresnan reverts to a better line and length, banging in a 'heavy ball' that jags up into the splice"
21,"Bresnan to Paine, no run and same again, he seems to have found his radar again"
22,"Bresnan to Paine, no run and again! Nice stuff from Bresnan, he's found a good length on this pitch and doesn't give any width either"
23,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run on a length, and jammed down to third man off an open face"
24,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run slightly shorter, Paine rises with the ball and sends it down to third man"
25,"Anderson to Watson, no run fuller, Watto again looks for the one to third man but this time the ball goes to Pietersen at second slip. On the bounce."
26,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs smeared across the line to midwicket! The ball was full, just outside off and he just drilled it through midwicket. Luke Wright was close in at midwicket but he barely had a chance to stop that. Was it a chance? Well, it almost took his head off it was so hard"
27,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs four more! Width from Anderson this time and Watson slashes up and over the slips and down to third man. Purposefully hit."
28,"Anderson to Watson, no run much better ball to finish, seaming in just a touch and full of length. Watson defends and the ball squirts off the inside edge to the leg side"
29,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run short, not quite the bouncer but it got up to chest height. Paine plays the ball one-handed towards square leg and they set off for a quick single"
30,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs easy, easy runs. Fine leg had just been brought up, Bresnan slipped one down towards leg stump and all he had to do was get bat on it."
31,"Bresnan to Watson, no run Watto is struck in the midriff! The ball wasn't that short but he went for an almighty swipe to midwicket. The ball rushed on to him to beat the shot"
32,"Bresnan to Watson, no run half an appeal from England as Bresnan gets a fuller one to seam in a little and strike the pad. He appeared to get some bat on it though. Woud've hit the top of middle."
33,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run jammed down just behind point and they charge through for a tight single"
34,"Bresnan to Paine, no run tight finish, on a length and zoning in on off stump and Paine defends"
35,"Anderson to Watson, no run tight lines, on off stump and defended"
36,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run a touch of width given, and the ball is run down to third man without drama"
37,"Anderson to Paine, no run full again, and defended"
38,"Anderson to Paine, FOUR runs where has that come from? Paine moved across to off stump and played a flamboyant one-legged flick over midwicket. He nailed it, really confident shot - and so it should be, there's not a lot on offer for the quick bowlers in this wicket"
39,"Anderson to Paine, no run punched defensively to the off side"
40,"Anderson to Paine, no run short and wide outside off, Paine goes for a full-blooded cut but can't get anything on it as the ball scoots past the outside edge"
41,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs well-played, he punched the ball square, just behind point, and picks up a couple as third man runs round"
42,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs aggression from Australia's openers! Bresnan runs his fingers over a slower one that ends up as a half-volley on off stump. Watson picked it early and slammed him up and over mid on. Strong shot!"
43,"Bresnan to Watson, no run Watto's struck again! He was going for that swivel-pull, but again the ball wasn't quite there to be hit and he's struck in the stomach. Doesn't flinch though..."
44,"Bresnan to Watson, no run on a length but wide, Watson goes for the slash to third man but the ball flies past the bat - no connection"
45,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run run down to third man, just the one"
46,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs well, after such a solid start Bresnan is beginning to lose it here. He bangs one in short but it's misdirected down the leg side and Paine has no trouble pulling the ball down to fine leg. He rolled his wrists over the ball nicely, keeping it down and finding perfect placement"
47,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs not a great start, Broad dishes up a juicy half-volley on leg stump and Watson flicks down to fine leg. The fielder is slight up in the circle there, so anything hit past him is runs"
48,"Broad to Watson, no run better, starting outside off and just tailing in a touch. Watson is nicely behind it to defend"
49,"Broad to Watson, no run sharp yorker from Broad, and England appeal for the lbw! Watson was struck on the toe, and then the bat as he jammed it down, but the umpire's not interested. That was mighty close, struck just outside off stump but that was hitting off."
50,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs good riposte from Watson, as he thrashes a full ball drifting in to the pads wide of mid on and down to the boundary"
51,"Broad to Watson, OUT Watto falls! Oh, he is utterly disconsolate as he walks off. Broad fired down a bumper, Watson was quickly into the pull - but perhaps too quick on the shot. The ball struck the leading edge - or possibly even the back of the bat - and looped ever so gently back towards Broad, who tumbled over in taking a good caught-and-bowled"
52,"Broad to Ponting, no run full on off stump, Ponting defends"
53,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run just a touch of width outside off, and Paine sends the ball down to third man to give his captain the strike"
54,"Bresnan to Ponting, 1 wide good pace from Bresnan, but mis-directed down the leg side. Ponting tried to hit it, but nothing on it and that's a wide"
55,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run on a length and straight, Ponting works him straight to midwicket off the back foot"
56,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run slipping towards leg stump, Ponting shapes to leg glance but is struck on the pad. Going down the leg side, though, so no appeal"
57,"Bresnan to Ponting, FOUR runs well, they need to get Ponting out early, but they're not going to get him like this. Attempted bouncer, but Ponting is back and across in a flash and pulls him down to fine leg for an easy boundary. The fielder was back on the rope, but is quite square"
58,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run fuller, clipped to midwicket"
59,"Bresnan to Ponting, no run punched out to point, no run"
60,"Broad to Paine, no run Broad starts it well, landing on a length and line on off stump, drawing nothing but careful defence"
61,"Broad to Paine, no run touch of in-drift here from Broad, very early for reverse-swing I'd have thought, met with the fullest of faces, from the fresh-faced Paine"
62,"Broad to Paine, no run another good straight ball meets another good straight bat, patted back to the bowler"
63,"Broad to Paine, 1 run touch shorter from Broad, allows Paine to swivel and pull carefully out to deep midwicket for a single"
64,"Broad to Ponting, 1 wide Broad digs one in short, and it's fairly quick, Ponting tucks under it and rises to see the umpire calling it wide, much to Broad's annoyance"
65,"Broad to Ponting, no run this is turning out to be a good over from Broad, on a length and line and Ponting nails a very solid defence"
66,"Broad to Ponting, no run slightly slower ball, and fuller too, Ponting check-drives back to Broad, who fields in his follow though and throws the ball back past Ponting to the wicketkeeper"
67,"Bresnan to Paine, no run long spell from Bresnan here, his sixth over, jumps wide of the crease and angles it in, Paine defends"
68,"Bresnan to Paine, 2 runs ooh! Pretty close, Paine tickled a fullish ball round the corner, and called for two, a touch of misunderstanding means Paine has to dive in as he completes the second, the throw from fine leg is a fraction wide so by the time Kieswetter has the bails off, Paine is safe"
69,"Bresnan to Paine, no run much quieter this delivery, just on off stump and defended back to the bowler"
70,"Bresnan to Paine, no run Paine looking to work Bresnan with the angle into the leg side, but Bresnan is mixing up his pace nicely, and Paine can't quite connect"
71,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run much more width on this, lures Paine into having a bit of a slash outside off stump, gets the inside edge and squirts away for a single"
72,"Bresnan to Ponting, 1 run Bresnan is probably lucky to get away with this, it was short, angling down the leg side, Ponting accepted the invitation to pull, but couldn't quite connect firmly and collected a scrappy single towards square leg"
73,"Broad to Ponting, no run tidy start to the over here, fullish on off stump and Ponting strides out and defends"
74,"Broad to Ponting, 1 run touch of drift into the legs and Ponting helps himself to a single out to deep midwicket"
75,"Broad to Paine, no run Broad, who has spent the last month in the gym, is trying to be aggressive here, fielding the ball and aiming a throw at Ponting at the non-strikers end"
76,"Broad to Paine, no run good tight bowling and Paine is happy to give nothing away, blocking away diligently"
77,"Broad to Paine, no run much shorter here, and quick too, zipping well past Paine who pulls out the way of the bouncer"
78,"Broad to Paine, 1 run dropped by Anderson, and what a catch it should have been! Paine tried to break the shackles, swiping across the line at Broad, but it was mistimed towards mid on where a diving Anderson got two hands to it but could not hold on"
79,"Wright to Paine, no run carefully defended this time by Paine"
80,"Wright to Paine, OUT gone this time! The mistake doesn't cost England as Luke Wright strikes. It was a touch slower, outside off, Paine aimed a cut shot but it found the inside edge, went on to his boot and on to the stumps"
81,"Wright to Clarke, no run oooh, almost added a third duck to his tour, this ghosted past the outside edge as Clarke hung his bat tentatively"
82,"Wright to Clarke, no run much more solid this time, meeting a full straight bat with a broad straight bat and patting it back to the bowler"
83,"Wright to Clarke, no run dug in a fraction shorter, and there was some width outside off, Clarke thought about a cut but opted to leave alone instead"
84,"Wright to Clarke, no run Wright completes an excellent over with another ball bang on target, Clarke tried to work it into the leg side but couldn't connect"
85,"Broad to Ponting, 1 run Ponting looks at ease among all the action, just turning this off his legs for a single to midwicket"
86,"Broad to Clarke, no run good stuff from Broad, full and attacking the stumps with a touch of inswing, Clarke carefully pushes it away"
87,"Broad to Clarke, no run Clarke yet to score but this is a well-played defensive shot, full-faced bat taps it back to the bowler"
88,"Broad to Clarke, 1 wide well, he's still on zero but only because Clarke couldn't reach it, very short and called a wide"
89,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run off the mark now, pushed delicately to point where a quick single becomes comfortable thanks to a needless fumble"
90,"Broad to Ponting, FOUR runs lovely shot, really top shot this, made it look so easy. Broad landed a slower ball a fraction wide outside off, Ponting got on his toes and caressed a back-foot drive through cover for four"
91,"Broad to Ponting, 1 run fuller ball this time, Ponting tickles it for a single and that ends the bowling Powerplay"
92,"Wright to Ponting, no run Ponting really strides into this forward defence, he's really bristling around the crease, busily patting down patches"
93,"Wright to Ponting, 2 runs little bit of width allows the batsman to open the face and guide this for a couple to third man"
94,"Wright to Ponting, no run fuller and straighter from Wright, Ponting pushes it firmly to mid on"
95,"Wright to Ponting, no run nicely bowled, Wright holding his nerve and landing it full on off stump, Ponting full-faces into the covers"
96,"Wright to Ponting, no run once again it's carefully defended, pushed into the cover region"
97,"Wright to Ponting, FOUR runs well, what was going to be a very good over has been undone in an instant. Ponting leant into a crisp drive, playing it on the up, to send it careering through the covers for four"
98,"Broad to Clarke, no run good stuff from Broad once more, landing it on and around middle stump, just short of a length, Clarke defends"
99,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run touch fuller from Broad, Clarke tucks it to mid on, and scampers a swift single"
100,"Broad to Ponting, 1 run quicker from Broad and a touch short, Ponting swivelled on a pull shot, placing it carefully down to fine leg for a single"
101,"Broad to Clarke, no run Clarke is pushing at the ball a fraction, which happens when you're out of nick, it means it comes off an inside edge flying into his unmentionables"
102,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run more comfortable here from Clarke, working it round the corner for a single"
103,"Broad to Ponting, 2 runs neatly played, just short of a length, Ponting worked it gently in front of midwicket to collect a couple"
104,"Wright to Clarke, 1 leg bye Wright lands this down the leg side, thuds off Clarke's thigh for a single"
105,"Wright to Ponting, OUT How about that!? Ponting has gone! Really gifted his wicket away there, it was short and angling down the leg side, Ponting tried to help a routine pull shot on it's way, but got under the ball, sending it in the air towards fine leg, where Broad ran around to his right and slid to take an excellent catch with both hands. Massive breakthrough for England"
106,"Wright to White, no run White gets a good yorker first up, and defends it very comfortably"
107,"Wright to White, 1 run good ball this, aggressive stuff from Wright, banged in and reared up at White, who got in an awful position and it came off the shoulder of the bat"
108,"Wright to Clarke, no run Wright really bounding in, finding decent pace and a decent line, Clarke defends"
109,"Wright to Clarke, no run good ball to finish the over, he's bowled very well so far today, good length and good line, defended watchfully"

111,"Yardy to White, no run slung in of off stump again, White content to watch carefully and defend"
112,"Yardy to White, no run just drifting on to middle stump, later in his innings White might have had a heave at, but here he blocks"
113,"Yardy to White, no run this just grips and sticks in the wicket a fraction, draws a slightly false defensive shot from White"
114,"Yardy to White, no run tidy stuff from Yardy, just restricting White, nothing fancy, on off stump and defended"
115,"Yardy to White, no run maiden over! Good on Yardy, White treating him with utmost respect. For now."
116,"Wright to Clarke, 1 run neatly done from Clarke, just pushing a good-length delivery into a space at cover for one"
117,"Wright to White, no run tight stuff from Wright again, on off stump, the batsman happy to defend"
118,"Wright to White, no run Wright has such a happy run-up, really bounds in like a puppy, the ball is less adorable though, forcing White into a hurried defensive block"
119,"Wright to White, no run White content to play himself in, defending diligently on off stump"
120,"Wright to White, FOUR runs and that's why. Too short, plenty of time for White to roll his thunderous arms over the ball and send a pull shot running away for four down to square leg"
121,"Wright to White, no run"
122,"Yardy to Clarke, no run Clarke hurries into a defensive block to cover"
123,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run for some reason mid off is deep, allowing Clarke to milk a gentle single"

127,"Yardy to White, 1 run single taken into the leg side"
128,"Anderson to White, no run left alone outside off stump to start"
129,"Anderson to White, OUT gone! Anderson changes ends and picks up a wicket, as White tries to force the ball through the covers off the back foot but gets an inside edge which cannons into his stumps! England continue to chip away at the Australian batting line-up, and a great deal now rests on Clarke and Hussey"
130,"Anderson to Hussey, no run is that a touch of reverse swing from Anderson? Surely too early for it, but this ball snaked away from Hussey sharply, and late too! Defended though."
131,"Anderson to Hussey, no run tapped defensively into the covers"
132,"Anderson to Hussey, no run good lines, starting on leg stump and just tucking Hussey up a touch as he shapes to clip to midwicket"
133,"Anderson to Hussey, no run fuller this time, and Hussey dead-bats it back down the wicket with the straightest of bats. Wicket maiden for Anderson!"
134,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke shuffles across to off and bunts down to long-on for one"
135,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run Hussey rocks quickly onto the back foot to force down to long on, and he's off the mark"
136,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run twinkle-toed use of the feet from Clarke, as he comes down the track and clips through midwicket"
137,"Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs nice placement from Hussey, as he sends the ball down towards third man. Picks up two, he didn't try to hit it too hard, just getting it past the man there"
138,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run easily worked down to long-off"
139,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run quicker one speared in to Clarke's pads, and he works the ball out to deep midwicket"
140,"Anderson to Clarke, no run punch-drive. Firmly hit, but straight to mid off."

143,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run tip-and-run from the batsmen, as Clarke drops the ball close in on the off side and they set off"
144,"Anderson to Hussey, no run Anderson has kept things very tight to Hussey so far, and this ball is no exception. Full and aimed at the stumps, and Mr. Cricket defends"
145,"Anderson to Hussey, no run angling across the left-hander, who taps the ball towards point and looks for the single. No runs on offer though, as the fielder charges in"
146,"Wright to Clarke, 1 run nice and straight to start, Clarke punches to mid on, where Pietersen fluffs a simple stop and they take a single as a result"
147,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run hmm, a few little fielding errors creeping in here. Hussey drives straight to Anderson in the covers, the ball slips under his hands and they take another single from a misfield"
148,"Wright to Clarke, 1 run on a length, punched just to mid-off's left and the call for a single comes straight away. Good running, no hesitation at all."
149,"Wright to Hussey, no run Hussey tries to clip to midwicket, but the ball takes the inside edge, bobbles off the pad and lands at his feet. He thinks about the cheeky single, but the England fielders quickly converge"
150,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run sliced down to third man for one"
151,"Wright to Clarke, no run driven hard along the ground to mid-off's right, where the fielder makes a good, tumbling stop. No run"
152,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run tapped between point and short third man and they set off for a sharp single"
153,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke comes down the track but can't get to the pitch, so instead thrusts his pad and bat out at the ball. Big turn from Swann, and bounce"
154,"Swann to Clarke, no run again he uses his feet, but can't get a good connection"
155,"Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs stays deep in the crease this time, Swann slips just a little short and he's carved away behind point for four. Intelligent batting from Clarke there, he had come down two balls in a row and then stayed right back"
156,"Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs four more, off the edge of the bat this time. Clarke went to drive down the ground but the ball went on with the arm, taking a thick edge and running down to third man"
157,"Swann to Clarke, no run punched into the leg side"
158,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run angling across Hussey from over the wicket, and the ball is easily worked down to third man"
159,"Wright to Clarke, no run back of a length, on or around off stump, and Clarke goes back and across to defend with a straight bat"
160,"Wright to Clarke, no run short, and wide of off but Clarke follows through with the pull. The ball was far too wide for the shot though, and it goes absolutely nowhere, trickling to mid on"
161,"Wright to Clarke, (no ball) FOUR runs classical shot! Wonderfully driven on the up through the covers by Clarke, all along the turf. What's more, Wright has over-stepped and that's a no-ball"
162,"Wright to Clarke, 1 run short, and pulled off the toe of the bat to deep midwicket"
163,"Wright to Hussey, 1 run short, and rearing up into Hussey's ribs. He rode the bounce admirably, however, dropping the ball on the leg side and Clarke immediately calls him through for one"
164,"Wright to Clarke, 1 run driven on the walk by Clarke, who gets a good connection but can't quite beat a tumbling mid off"
165,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke dances down the track, Swann sees him coming and pulls the length back and he's defended"
166,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run down the track again, gets to the pitch this time and drives him out to cover"

172,"Wright to Clarke, no run driven straight to mid on"
173,"Wright to Clarke, FOUR runs and, just as that comment comes through, Wright slips short and is pulled away to the square leg boundary by Clarke. There are two men out there, but he found great placement with a well-controlled pull"
174,"Wright to Clarke, no run much fuller this time, Clarke comes down the track and drives on the walk back to Wright, who picks the ball up and sends the batsman scrambling back to his crease"
175,"Wright to Clarke, FOUR runs confident shot! Very full again and Clarke swings through the line and nails a superb straight drive down the ground. Aesthetically pleasing, to say the least."
176,"Wright to Clarke, no run full again, but not quite there for the drive and Clarke defends out into the covers"
177,"Swann to Hussey, 2 runs just too full from Swann, Hussey drives out through the covers and the sweeper on the boundary has to run to his left to cut it off, allowing them to get back for two"
178,"Swann to Hussey, no run much better length, and Hussey defends off the front foot"
179,"Swann to Hussey, no run again, floated up nicely and on the right length, Hussey stretches forward to smother the spin"

182,"Swann to Clarke, no run defends off the front foot with the full face of the bat"
183,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run driven hard out square on the off side by Hussey, but there's a boundary fielder to cut it off"
184,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run just a touch short from Yardy, and Clarke stays deep in the crease, punching down to long on for one to bring up the fifty partnership"
185,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run dragged down short again, Hussey is quickly back into a powerful pull, but straight out to the fielder"
186,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run tapped into the covers, a touch of hesitation in the running! The throw comes in, fairly softly it must be said, and they appeal for the run out but he was easily in."
187,"Yardy to Hussey, no run Hussey looks to chop the ball down to third man but he's cramped for room and can't get it away"
188,"Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs width given this time, and Hussey slashes him down behind square for a couple"

206,"Swann to Hussey, 3 runs ovely bowling this, and if there was a slip this would have been out, looped up outside off, spinning away, Hussey drives, it comes off the edge and Morgan has to run down to the third man boundary, and slides well to keep it to three"
207,"Yardy to Hussey, OUT the ball change, the drinks, and Michael Yardy have done the trick! Hussey has gone! Really nothing dismissal that, outside off, skidded on a touch with the newer ball perhaps, got a faint outside edge, and Hussey walked"
208,"Yardy to Hopes, no run starts well enough, blocking out a darting yorker"
209,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run oh dear, mid off back to the new batsman, how very needless, Hopes doesn't mind, he pushes to long on for a easy single"
210,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 wide oops, darted well down the leg side from Yardy and he'll have to bowl another"
211,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke trying to give himself room to squeeze out a cut shot, but can't collect one"
212,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run single here though, repeating the shot, connecting well enough for a single to cover"
213,"Yardy to Clarke, no run"
214,"Swann to Hopes, no run Swann landing it on a decent line and length and Hopes blocks"
215,"Swann to Hopes, no run more good stuff from Swann, Hopes happy to dig in for a while"

217,"Swann to Hopes, 1 run single this time, full and pushed into the covers for one"
218,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke can't get one here, defending carefully off the front foot"
219,"Swann to Clarke, no run good end to a good over, Clarke blocking away diligently"
220,"Yardy to Hopes, no run good again, darting it into the batsman, who can do nothing but defend"
221,"Yardy to Hopes, no run very nicely done again from Yardy, building pressure"
222,"Yardy to Hopes, no run nothing for the batsman to latch on to, very accurate stuff"
223,"Yardy to Hopes, no run quietly blocked once again"
224,"Yardy to Hopes, no run still nothing for Hopes, all defence"
225,"Yardy to Hopes, no run neatly blocked to finish a maiden over"
226,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke collects a single straight away, skipping down the wicket and pushing to long on"
227,"Swann to Hopes, 1 run Hopes gets into the swing of things now, milking a single down the ground"
228,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke is doing this very well, working the ball around with ease"
229,"Swann to Hopes, 2 runs Hopes gets a touch of width and cuts past a diving point for a couple"
230,"Swann to Hopes, 1 run now he helps himself to a single, pushing down the ground"
231,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke brings up a very useful fifty. He was struggling for runs this tour, started slowly but has played the spinners superbly today"
232,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke continues his merry single taking, chipping down the crease and clipping a single down to long on"
233,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run Hopes follows the example set by his vice-captain, and dabs a single to midwicket"
234,"Yardy to Clarke, no run nothing for Clarke here, too quick from Yardy, hurries the shot"
235,"Yardy to Clarke, no run more good stuff from Yardy, Clarke given nothing to work with"
236,"Yardy to Clarke, no run good ball, quicker, flatter, Clarke defends"
237,"Yardy to Clarke, no run touch of extra bounce, Clarke dabs to short third man"
238,"Swann to Hopes, no run good stuff from Swann, changing his pace nicely, Hopes can't set himself so blocks"
239,"Swann to Hopes, no run defended once again, almost some pressure building here"
240,"Swann to Hopes, FOUR runs ah, that will do nicely. Really top shot this, Hopes comes down the wicket and chips very carefully, and times it nicely, into a gap at cow corner for a welcome boundary"
241,"Swann to Hopes, no run defended carefully"
242,"Swann to Hopes, 1 run clipped away for a single"
243,"Swann to Clarke, 2 runs good from Clarke, picking a gap and collecting a couple"
244,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run Yardy really darting them in, difficult to get away but Hopes manages to squeeze out a single"
245,"Yardy to Clarke, FOUR runs touch of width and Clarke takes full toll, skipping leg side of the ball and cutting well behind point for four"
246,"Yardy to Clarke, no run ooh, almost repeated the shot, but it skidded on a fraction and past the edge of Clarke's cut"
247,"Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs this time Clarke goes leg side, flicking round the corner for two"
248,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run back to milking mode here, edging down the wicket and pushing down the ground for a single"
249,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run Hopes bunts a single down the ground to finish the over"
250,"Bresnan to Hopes, no run good start - not traditional death bowling, back of a length, but nice and straight and there's nothing Hopes can do with that"
251,"Bresnan to Hopes, 2 runs errs in line this time, too much width and he's cut away very hard towards the point boundary. A superb sliding stop from Anderson cuts the ball off though"
252,"Bresnan to Hopes, no run back of a length again, Hopes can't seem to get it away when it's straight"
253,"Bresnan to Hopes, 1 run a touch shorter this time, Hopes aims a meaty pull out to deep midwicket where Morgan fields not quite cleanly, but they decide against what would have been a risky two"
254,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run too straight this time, and he's clipped down to fine leg"
255,"Bresnan to Hopes, FOUR runs short again, Hopes has his eye in now and he's slapped this very hard in front of square on the leg side! The bowling plan backfired a bit there... taking nothing away from a top shot from Hopes"
256,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run backs away, Anderson flings down an inch-perfect yorker which he jams the bat down on. The ball goes nowhere, but Hauritz immediately charges through, racing Anderson to the other end and winning"
257,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run punched to cover, they set off immediately for the single"
258,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run full again, but wide of off, and the ball is jammed out behind square on the off side"
259,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run sharp bouncer, and Hauritz wasn't expecting that! Really well-directed, nasty short ball, Hauritz took his eyes off it and is struck on the glove. The ball goes in to space down to third man and they take one"
260,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run full, straight and drilled down to long on"
261,"Anderson to Hauritz, no run slower bouncer to Hauritz this time, he seemed to pick it, waiting on the pull shot, but couldn't connect with the ball as it looped past his grille"
262,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run waist-high full toss, Clarke tries to paddle him to fine leg but straight to the fielder. Touch and go for the high no-ball"
263,"Broad to Hauritz, no run bouncer from Broad, not all that sharp but it's good enough to beat Hauritz's swipe as he backs away to leg and aims to flay over off"
264,"Broad to Hauritz, 1 run back of a length again, Hauritz backs away and drops the ball into the covers, they take a sharp single"
265,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run slow cutter, just short of a length, and it's flat-batted down to long on"
266,"Broad to Hauritz, FOUR runs well, Hauritz is finally coming to terms with this short-pitched attack. Another bumper, he backs to leg, setting himself, and lifts the ball up and over the keeper and away to third man"
267,"Broad to Hauritz, FOUR runs and again, mirror image to the last shot! A somewhat predictable bouncer from Broad, this time Hauritz didn't back away and just helped the ball very fine on the leg side. Four more valuable runs for Australia"
268,"Yardy to Clarke, no run good start, Clarke skips down the track and Yardy spears one at his toes, almost yorking him"

270,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run floaty - for Yardy - and he's driven down to long on"

272,"Yardy to Hopes, no run clipped straight to midwicket in the circle"
273,"Yardy to Hopes, 1 run stylishly driven down to long off to end Yardy's spell, and well-bowled!"
274,"Bresnan to Hopes, 1 run full, fast and straight, Hopes stays leg side of the ball and drives down to long off"
275,"Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs full toss on off stump, Clarke drives him out to the cover sweeper. He could have hit that anywhere, it was a strangely passive shot"
276,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run Clarke backs away to leg as Bresnan digs one in short. The ball is dropped softly into the covers, and they're across for a sharp single"
277,"Bresnan to Hopes, no run in the blockhole, Hopes jams the bat down on the ball to send it on to the leg side, but Morgan scoots across from midwicket to cut it off"
278,"Bresnan to Hopes, 3 runs going for the yorker again, but this one has slipped out as a half-volley on leg stump and he's firmly clipped wide of midwicket. Good running fetches them three as Wright sprints round to cut the ball off"
279,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run punched down to long on, and that brings up the fifty partnership between these two, which is good news for Australia - they haven't let the loss of Hussey slow their momentum too much"
280,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run full toss on leg stump, lifted out to deep midwicket but bouncing well short of any fielders"
281,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run another full toss on leg stump, clipped along the ground this time but out to midwicket again"
282,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke backs away but Anderson follows him with a slower cutter, just one run as Clarke slams him down to long on"
283,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run full and wide of off, Hauritz tries to drive through the covers but can't quite time it, the cover fielder cutting it off and just one run taken"
284,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run pinpoint yorker, Clarke jams his bat down to send the ball into the leg side and they take another one"
285,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 leg bye comical stuff, Hauritz shuffles right across to off and sets himself for the scoop over the keeper. The ball was well wide of off though, he re-adjusted but knocked himself off his feet as he does so. Recovered in time to complete the single and keep the strike though"
286,"Broad to Hauritz, 1 run full toss on middle, slapped down to long on"
287,"Broad to Clarke, 2 runs on a length outside off, punched down to long on where some sluggish fielding allows them to charge back for the second!"
288,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run backs away to leg and Broad follows him with a full ball. The ball takes the edge, cannons off the boot and loops to the off side. Clarke is disappointed he couldn't make more of that"
289,"Broad to Hauritz, FOUR runs another paddle-scoop from Hauritz, and this time he pulls it off excellently! He never took his eyes off the ball as Broad fired one down wide of off, getting a good connection to lift the ball up and over the field"
290,"Broad to Hauritz, OUT gone this time! Full toss on leg stump, and it's softly tapped straight to Strauss at mid off. He didn't even have to move! Still, Hauritz has done a good job"
291,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run just a single to finish as Clarke goes across to the off side, tries to flick to leg but gets another edge on to the pad which goes towards third man. Clarke is disappointed not to have capitalised once again, swinging his bat in anger."
292,"While the players take the mid-innings break, have a look at Brydon's bulletin. And do stay with us for England's chase, which will start at 6.45pm."
293,"So, Australia close on 267 for 7, which is a decent total and just about par on this pitch. Clarke did well to keep going when wickets fell, and played a role in the two biggest partnerships of the innings, for the fifth and sixth wickets with Hussey and Hopes. But he never really changed gear towards the end, and generally struggled to find the boundary. Six bowlers were used by England, and the stand-out performers were surely Yardy and Wright, the two allrounders, who generally kept"
294,"Just a quick reminder about the ESPN Player - you can watch this game live on the player, but unfortunately this service is only available in Europe (but not in the UK)."
295,"Bollinger will open the bowling, left arm over the wicket, two slips in place."
296,"Righty, the players are out there, England need 268. Andrew Strauss will open alongside Craig Kieswetter and will Ricky Ponting go with Josh Hazlewood first up? Amusingly enough, despite the blazing sunshine, the floodlights are on. These people know nothing about carbon footprints clearly."
297,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run starts with an energetic but misdirected ball, down the leg side, which Strauss can't quite tickle away"
298,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 wide ooop, Bollinger has got this all wrong. Quickish yes, but miles down the leg side"
299,"Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs this is the Strauss brand of 'Power Hitting', clipping a full half-volley on leg stump through midwicket for four. All along the ground"
300,"Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs and again! Strauss flying, nothing more than a gentle push through midwicket for another boundary, not a particularly great ball that"
301,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run Bollinger bustling in, and gets this one right, just outside off stump, Strauss leaves it alone"
302,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run ooh, first real test for Strauss, full and straight, drifting in a touch and rapping Strauss on the pads, would have uprooted middle but there was a faint inside edge"
303,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run ooh, play and a miss from Strauss to finish the over. Short and wide, Strauss, for once, misses a cut"
304,"Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run Harris straight into his stride, landing this in at 89mph, defended carefully for a single"
305,"Harris to Strauss, no run too short and pushed across Strauss, perhaps the batsman should have cut because the pull shot was mistimed to mid on"
306,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run swift bowling this, banged in short and wide, Strauss does cut this time, playing it nicely to third man"
307,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run good ball here, on a length and line, Kieswetter meets it with a very straight bat and defends"
308,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run touch shorter here, but good line again, Kieswetter stands up on his toes and defends"
309,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run good second half to the over that, bang on a line and length and Kieswetter once again, can only defend"
310,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run much better start from Bollinger to this over, fuller and straighter and Strauss pats it to mid on"
311,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run nudged neatly into the midwicket region for a gentle single, not much movement off the pitch or in the air here"
312,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run looks like an Australian plan not to go full to Kieswetter, everything has been back of a length, and once again it's defended"
313,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, FOUR runs touch of width here, and it does not matter what length you bowl if there's width, Kieswetter stands tall and crisply punches through the covers for four"
314,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run well, interesting leave that. Kieswetter staying leg side of the ball, showing all three stumps, and the ball bounces over middle"
315,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run another leave, very diligent from the young man"
316,"Harris to Pietersen, no run plenty of chat from the Aussie fielders, and why not, Pietersen though, defends very comfortably"
317,"Harris to Pietersen, no run ah, the full and straight attack at Pietersen, haven't really seen that since Steyn in South Africa, Pietersen digs out the yorker"
318,"Harris to Pietersen, no run good stuff from Harris, giving nothing away early, and Pietersen is forced into a hurried defence"
319,"Harris to Pietersen, no run good again from Harris, full and on off stump, Pietersen defends"
320,"Harris to Pietersen, no run beaten! Holding that off-stump line, Pietersen pushes a touch aimlessly at it, there was a faint faint sound, but nothing given. Plenty of chat from Australia, plenty"
321,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 run dug in short first up, Kieswetter leaps to cut it away nicely down to third man"
322,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run well, another one! Australia really sizzling now! It was down the leg side, massive appeal as Pietersen missed his leg-side nudge, this time there was no doubt in the decision but still there is plenty of noise from both the crowd and the fielders"
323,"Bollinger to Pietersen, (no ball) 1 run finally a calm single for Pietersen, pushed to mid off. Bollinger strained over the line, which means the next ball will be Free Hit time"
324,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, FOUR runs comical stuff this, Kieswetter ran miles outside leg stump, Bollinger pushed it across outside off stump, and somehow the batsman managed to reach for it and squirt it through for four to third man"
325,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run oh dear, horrid shot this. Kieswetter giving himself room again, before swishing hopelessly at it"
326,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run after all that excitement Kieswetter opts for a classic leave outside off stump"
327,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run another orthodox shot to finish the over, calmly defending a length ball on off stump"
328,"Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs lovely shot this time from Pietersen. Very simple, just leaning forward into a punched check-drive back past the bowler for four"
329,"Harris to Pietersen, no run fuller and angling down the leg side, Pietersen clips it firmly to midwicket and Harris has a massive lbw appeal, oddly"
330,"Harris to Pietersen, no run this time it's outside off stump and Pietersen leaves it well alone"
331,"Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen skips down the wicket, looking for a flamingo-clip through midwicket, but misses and it raps him on the pads"
332,"Harris to Pietersen, no run no fuss here, simple cricket, good ball just outside off stump, left alone"
333,"Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen just going at the ball a little hard here, full and outside off and driven off the inside edge to mid on"
334,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run good stuff from Bollinger, nothing for Kieswetter to work with, so the batsman defends"
335,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run Kieswetter looking for his favourite inside-out shot over cover, but he skips so far leg side of the ball that he can't reach it"
336,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 run this time Kieswetter plays from the crease and guides it to third man"
337,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run neatly done, Pietersen takes a big stride to a length ball, pushes it to mid off and takes a single"
338,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, FOUR runs lovely timing, really nicely done. Full and pushed across Kieswetter who leant forward and punched it through cover for four"
339,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 run single to finish the over, dabbed into the cover region"
340,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run Ryan Harris is full of chat, must be because he's bowling quite nicely, forcing a defence from Kieswetter"
341,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run good ball again, on a length and line and blocked"
342,"Harris to Kieswetter, FOUR runs give Kieswetter width and you will be punished. Short and wide outside off and Kieswetter threw everything at it, flashing it hard through point for four"
343,"Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run touch straighter this time, means Kieswetter can't flash it away, instead it's guided to third man"
344,"Harris to Pietersen, 1 run good running from Pietersen, happy to play second-fiddle for a while, pushing to mid on and scampering one"
345,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run very correct forward defence to finish the over"
346,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, FOUR runs starts with a nervy full toss outside off stump and Pietersen climbed into an off-drive between cover and mid off for four"
347,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, 1 run better ball this time, on a length, but the line is wrong and Pietersen tickles it round the corner for a single"
348,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run that's his best ball yet, fullish, on off stump and met with a careful forward defence"
349,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run settling down now, decent pace, not express or anything, on middle and clipped to midwicket"
350,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run ooh, inch-perfect leave, Kieswetter would argue, but it was very close to off stump"
351,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, FOUR runs ooh, almost a first ODI wicket for Hazlewood, Kieswetter skipped down the wicket and aimed a big drive down the ground, didn't quite time it, but got enough on it to clear mid off"
352,"Harris to Pietersen, no run more good, pacey stuff from Harris, fullish and Pietersen prodded it to mid on"
353,"Harris to Pietersen, no run similar ball, similar shot, full, angling in, Pietersen aims a drive but it skews off the inside edge to mid on"

355,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run good from Harris, angling into Kieswetter, not giving any space to free his arms"
356,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run another good ball, carefully defended once more"

359,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, 1 leg bye Pietersen skips down the wicket, trying to unsettle the youngster, but misses his attempted flick and it comes off his pads. An inexplicable overthrow allows one"
360,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, 1 run shorter this time, Kieswetter looks a touch unsure of the shot as he pulls down to deep square for one"
361,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, FOUR runs close again! Pietersen living dangerously here, big outside edge flies wide of first slip and down to the boundary for four"

364,"Watson to Pietersen, no run slammed to mid off, no run"
365,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run back of a length on middle, KP stays back and swipes him through midwicket. There's a man out there though"

368,"Watson to Pietersen, FOUR runs imperious! Harmless ball from Watson, and Pietersen just stood at the crease and thumped him through the covers"
369,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run misfield now! Punched straight to mid-off, who over-runs the ball and allows the batsmen an easy single"

372,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, 2 runs not all that short, but Pietersen sways back and pulls behind square. Didn't get all of that, and the fielder on the rope scoots round to cut it off"
373,"Hazlewood to Pietersen, 3 runs overthrows, and that's woken the crowd up! Hazelwood sent down a slow cutter just outside off, which was tapped into space in the covers.

374,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run pushed defensively towards point"
375,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run Kieswetter comes down to play the flyswatter, shuffling to leg and looking to go inside-out through the covers, but slams the ball straight to the man at extra cover"
376,"Watson to Pietersen, no run wobbling in just a touch through the air, Pietersen clips to midwicket"

386,"Hazlewood to Kieswetter, no run and he goes fuller, Kieswetter driving to mid off"

391,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run driven on the other side of the wicket this time, but again picks out the fielder"
392,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run beaten! It was more the perfect line and length than any movement by the ball, though, as Watto sent one down in the channel on off stump and Collingwood played inside it. Very close to the edge - and not far from off stump - but no harm done"
393,"Hazlewood to Morgan, 1 run Morgan off the mark straight away, running one off the outer half of the bat down to third man"
394,"Hazlewood to PD Collingwood, no run fuller, and quite wide. Collingwood drives, somewhat leaden-footed, and the ball rolls slowly to mid off"

396,"Hazlewood to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood still not off the mark, pushing the ball into the covers once again"
397,"Hazlewood to PD Collingwood, 1 run slips one in to his pads, and he's off the mark now in fitting style, nurdling one out to midwicket"

401,"Watson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs pushed out to deep cover off the back foot"
402,"Watson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Watto tries something different, banging one in halfway down, and Collingwood just pushes his weight back and pulls down to fine leg, where the fielder slides but can't cut it off"
403,"Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run driven into the covers off the front foot. Well-hit, but he can't quite pierce the gap"
404,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length, angling across Collingwood who pushes it to leg"
405,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run similar ball, this time he tries to go through the off side but the ball comes off the inside edge onto the pad. Morgan calls him through for a sharp single"

407,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run Bollinger charges in and sends down a well-directed bouncer! That was pretty sharp, but Collingwood buckled his knees to get underneath it in good time"

412,"Watson to Morgan, no run well, no great pace or danger from the ball, but Morgan just pulls his bat out of the way and watches it go past him. He's taking his time to play himself in, which is the right thing to do in the situation - what England need is a partnership"
413,"Watson to Morgan, no run Watto holds this one cross-seam, and it just seams away a touch after pitching. Pushed softly to cover"
414,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run slipping on to the pads, and he's worked away to fine leg"
415,"Bollinger to Wright, 3 runs that's just the sort of start he would've been hoping for - just a gentle full toss outside off stump and he crunches it out to cover. Quick running fetches him three"

426,"Hopes to Wright, 1 run this time it's nudged into the leg side to pick up a comfortable single"

454,"Hazlewood to Wright, 1 wide Hazlewood trying to repeat the line, but goes a little too far outside off and Wright leaves it alone"

470,"Hazlewood to Morgan, 1 run good running here, dropped into the off side and the batsman set off straight away for a quick single"
