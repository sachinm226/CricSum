550,Thanks everyone for all the mails through the day. Abhishek Purohit is frantically trying to capture all that happened in the game in his match report. I'll see you all in the fourth ODI - spend the interim pondering what changes India should/will make to their bowling. G'night.
551,"Oh boy, what a finish that was. India's death over bowling was always a concern, but Faulkner's 64 off 29 has exposed it totally. For years, the mention of Ishant also had people thinking of that Perth spell to Ponting, I think his over to Faulkner is going to reach (dis)similarly legendary status."
552,Post-match presentation:
553,"Anyone else feeling sorry for Dhoni. First a masterclass to save the side after most of the other batsmen muck it up, then to see the target chased down in this manner."
554,Poor Ishant is getting a barrage of unprintable mails. Even some calls for Agarkar to un-retire.
555,"Doubly impressive from Faulkner as he was taken apart in the final over by Dhoni, he's turned it around with the bat though, and how?"
556,Australia won by 4 wickets (with 3 balls remaining)
557,"Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS"
