17,"Starc to S Dhawan, OUT knocks out off stump with a trademark delivery! He's back. Starc is back. High 140s, outswinger starting middle and curving viciously towards off. Dhawan's got his front leg in the leg side and his stumps exposed as he creates room for the drive through cover. The late swing and the pace does him and it's a pretty sight as the st"
18,"Starc to Kohli, 1 wide full and very wide outside off. Searching for that swing, but this is past the tramline. Kohli lets it go"
19,"Starc to Kohli, 1 run full and just outside off, waits on that, gets into a crouch and opens the face to steer this to third man"
20,"Hazlewood to Kohli, 1 run good length on middle stump, shuffles and clips to deep square"

40,"Swepson to Rahul, 1 run short and turning away, wide outside off. Pulled along the ground to long-on"
41,"Swepson to Kohli, OUT balloons back to the bowler. The only thing going for Swepson this ball is that it has gripped.

102,"Henriques to Jadeja, 1 run short outside off, driven wide of cover but the sweeper keeps them to a single"
103,"Henriques to Hardik, 2 runs Abbott saves a six with a palm back! Almost a fantastic catch, but he couldn't flick it back up as we see so often now. Pandya launched it towards long-on, not quite with the distance needed. Abbott leaped on the rope and did very well"
104,"Henriques to Hardik, OUT high...very high, and taken at long-off! Pandya is cut off before he can really get going, gets all height on this one, low down on the bat, Smith has plenty of time to get underneath it"

112,"Starc to Sundar, no run a wide yorker outside off, Sundar plays over the top of it"

114,"Hazlewood to Jadeja, no run similar stroke, but the ball was a touch wider and he had to reach of it...picks out cover on the ring"
115,"Hazlewood to Jadeja, (no ball) 2 runs goes down on his back knee and slog sweeps over midwicket, superb work on the boundary as Smith gets across from long-on and keeps it in play...but it's a no-ball!"
116,"Hazlewood to Jadeja, 2 runs back of a length outside off, one hand comes off the bat as he swings to the leg side and it comes off a top edge...lack of timing allows a second"
117,"Hazlewood to Jadeja, SIX runs that's MASSIVE! Full outside off, Jadeja picks it up and swings it miles back over deep square leg. Almost onto the root of the stand"

125,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run gets the yorker in to finish, inside edge into the boot and they manage the single"
126,"Elsewhere, East Bengal - coached by Robbie Fowler, formerly of Brisbane Roar - are off to a poor start in their maiden season in the ISL. Can they turn their fortunes around? Read more here."

128,"That's a big finish for India, but we await to see how bad Jadeja's injury - which appears to be a hamstring - is and whether he can bowl. India's badly lost momentum in the middle of that innings against excellent spells by Zampa and Henriques. Starc and Hazlewood didn't quite get it right in the last couple of overs and Jadeja found his range. It has given"

167,"Chahar to Finch, 1 run dropped at backward point. Manish Pandey flying to his right. Gets two hands on it but loses it when he's on the way down. It's a length ball outside off, Finch slashes at that. You count on Pandey to hold on to these sort of chances, but it was a difficult ask"
168,"Chahar to Short, no run dropped at cover! Virat Kohli puts down a sitter. A short ball getting steep at a middle stump line. Short backs away and has a hack as it gets big on him. Skies it high. Kohli has ages to get under it. By the time the ball comes down, he's arching backwards and has the reverse cup. Bursts through him"

174,"Chahal to Short, 1 run good length outside, looks to hammer that through cover. Ends up slicing feebly to sweeper"
175,"Chahal to Finch, OUT oh sensational catch from Pandya! This will grate on Australia, no doubt. The concussion sub has a wicket. And it's a good ball. Lobbed up at off stump, full and dipping. Finch backs away looking to go over extra cover. Ends up slicing it because he's not to the pitch. Pandya then sprints some 20 yards to his left from long-off, co"

188,"Chahal to Smith, OUT Samson you stunner! Oh boy! We saw a good one from Pandya earlier but this was, by some degree, a harder one. It's flat, it's dipping, it's absolutely laced across the line. Samson runs in from deep midwicket, staying low at every point and then dives to pick it up low and in front of himself. That took so much hurried movement tha"
189,"Chahal to Maxwell, 2 runs just wide of long-off! A googly, good length and outside off. Maxwell checks his attempted drive and ends up lofting it gently"
190,"Natarajan to Short, 1 run driven into the covers"
191,"Natarajan to Maxwell, no run edged, just short of the keeper! Length ball, angled across, Maxwell pushes at it and gets a healthy nick but it lands just in front of the Rahul's gloves"
192,"Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT huge appeal for lbw! And Kohli has reviewed almost before the ball stops rolling away. Where did it pitch? Was smashing the stumps for sure. Maxwell playing back to a short of a length delivery. Beaten for pace. We have a small delay waiting for ball tracking. And now the pitch map is missing from the replay. Here it comes..."
