195,"Zampa to Jadhav, OUT gone, that's a soft dismissal. Full and wide outside off, perhaps too full to play the lofted drive over short extra-cover. Goes for it and hits it straight to the fielder"
196,"Zampa to Dhoni, OUT and he's gone first ball! Perhaps not short enough to cut, or wide enough, and it hurries through off the pitch. Dhoni rocks back and only manages a thick edge that is gobbled up brilliantly at slip by Usman Khawaja falling to his right. He wouldn't have had"

416,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run a little slower, on off stump, stays back to open his bat face and steer to deep point"
417,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run fullish on middle and leg, defended back down the pitch"
418,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run ooh, well bowled. Comes forward and looks to drive to long-off. Ball doesn't pitch as full as he thinks, and goes on with the arm. Plays it back to the bowler off the inner half of the bat"
419,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run a touch short, goes back to cut but the ball holds up off the surface and he has to adjust, wait, and stab to backward point"
420,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run massive turn. Goes back to a length ball, looking to work it with the spin. There's way more turn than he expects, though, pitches on off stump, raises a cloud of dust, and smacks him on the thigh pad"
421,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 2 runs tossed up slower, stretches out to paddle it gently into the fine leg region"
422,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run tossed up on off stump, swept once more to fine leg"
423,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run nicely flighted, dips onto a good length on off stump. Maxwell waits, reads the wrong'un off the pitch, and pushes to extra-cover"
424,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run another wrong'un, and Kuldeep beats Maxwell and causes him to overbalance. MS Dhoni appeals for a stumping... Nah. He lifted his back foot momentarily but he jammed it back down quickly. Lovely delivery, floated this wider than the previous one and Max"
425,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run fuller now, on middle stump, clipped down to long-on"
426,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run length ball angling into off stump, clipped into the leg side and midwicket dives right to stop it"
427,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run well bowled. Length ball straightening slightly after angling in towards off stump. Stays back and gets opened up slightly while punching into the covers"
428,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Gets on the back foot to push towards mid-on, who's deep enough to allow a scampered single"
429,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run back of a length, angling in towards middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball to try and manufacture a single into the off side, but extra-cover moves quickly to his left to cut it off"
430,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run full, close to off stump, gets on the front foot and drives straight to cover point"
431,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run back of a length, angling into the top of middle stump. Clipped watchfully to midwicket"
432,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run tossed up outside off, gets a good stride forward to drive but can't beat extra-cover"
433,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run back of a length outside off, punches it away but without too much power, and backward point moves a few steps to his right to stop it"
434,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, OUT a string of dots, Maxwell looks to force it, and Kuldeep gets a bit of inconsistent bounce off the surface to get his man. Shortish, maybe not short enough to pull, and he exposes his stumps as he opens up to do so. Keeps really low and sneaks under his b"
435,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, pitching just outside off. Worked with the turn through square leg"
436,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run tossed up slow outside off, stretches out to paddle it fine"
437,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, wrong'un, turns from leg to off. Stays back and whips to deep square leg"

439,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length, angling in towards top of off. Blocked back to the bowler"
440,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend into the off side"
441,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run length ball on off stump, and Vijay does very well to dive to his left and stop the ball at mid-off. A crisply timed drive, amounts to nothing"
442,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run fullish slower ball outside off, gets half-forward again and defends gently towards short midwicket, lets the ball hit his bat"
443,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs it into the point region"
444,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run beauty. Tossed up invitingly outside off, Stoinis barely gets a stride in to defend and ends up pushing at the ball, a long way in front of his body. Creates a big gap for the ball to spin through, and only the extra bounce saves him"
445,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run fuller now, clipped gently into the on side"
446,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run tossed up slow outside off, reaches out again for a tentative push back to the bowler"
447,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run length ball spinning in towards off stump. Presses forward to defend into the on side"
448,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run and he's immediately in action, Kohli the fielder, throws himself to his left after Stoinis presses forward and finds himself nowhere near the pitch of a big-spinning, bouncing stock ball, bat and pad close together. Pops off the outside of his pad, do"
449,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run fuller now, driven to sweeper cover"
450,"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run fired in flat on middle stump, presses forward and blocks into the on side"
451,"Jadeja to Stoinis, 3 runs a little slower, this length ball outside off. Turns away after stopping on the track. Stoinis opens his bat face to ease it behind backward point"
452,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run flat length ball straightening towards off stump. Good use of the bottom hand to shovel this standing sweep towards fine leg"
453,"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run flat length ball on off stump, stays on the back foot and punches to short extra-cover"
454,"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run again, stays back to a length ball and punches it to short extra-cover"

456,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run floated up slow on off stump, driven to long-off"
457,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run back of a length outside off, hardly any bounce. Makes a bit of room and punches towards extra-cover, where Dhyawan makes a driving stop"
458,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run back of a length again, punched to extra-cover"
459,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs tossed up extremely slow, angling down leg. Paddled away nice and fine to pick up a couple"
460,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run ooh, Dhoni nearly manufactures a wicket out of nowhere! Again it's slow, again the line is leg-stumpish, and again Handscomb looks to paddle. Off the glove, and Dhoni started moving to the leg side as soon as he began shaping for that shot. He's in po"
461,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run wider outside off this time, and the ball keeps low to sneak under the attempted sweep"
462,"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run flat, angling into the pads, nurdled gently into the square leg region"
463,"Jadeja to Handscomb, FOUR runs flat, angling towards leg stump, and Handscomb sweeps it away firm and hard to the backward square leg boundary"
464,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run full on off stump, driven to long-on"
465,"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run full on leg stump, moves his feet away from the line to drive to long-off"

467,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run flat length ball sliding on towards off stump, cramps him for room and he blocks to midwicket"
468,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run steps out but with Jadhav bowling so slow - and slinging it through so low - Stoinis can only knock it back where it came from"
469,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run good length ball outside off, beats his back-foot push as it curves away in the air"
470,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run"
471,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run keeps so low and Stoinis is just about able to whip it to midwicket. Jadhav's line - always attacking the stumps - is so dangerous on slow, unevenly bouncing pitch"
472,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 wide tries to work it away to fine leg but misses making contact"
473,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run short and wide, but even then, the lack of pace off the pitch means his cut shot only finds cover"
474,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run turns it towards square leg, searching for a single, but it's not there. Only the wide off that very quick over"
475,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run stays back to a good length ball, backing his skills with the cut shot, but even still he only escapes chopping on."
476,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 leg bye goes for the sweep the moment Jadeja's line is on the stumps, wanders off the pad behind square leg"
477,"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run steps out to turn a full delivery on the stumps into a full toss and thumps it down to long-on"
478,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run premeditates the sweep and that allows Jadeja to hang the ball outside the off stump, looking to beat the batsman and set up a stumping. No such luck, even though he does beat the batsman"
479,"Jadeja to Handscomb, FOUR runs sweep again and this one too is outside off - but the key here is Handscomb doesn't premeditate. He only reacts. He knows the ball is on a length. He knows he can get under it and hammer it away to the square leg boundary"
480,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run another measured sweep to end the over, single to square leg"
481,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run goes back to a length ball that sneaks through at ankle height on middle stump. Manages to clip it away into the leg side"
482,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run again he's on the back foot, again there's hardly any bounce. Just outside off this time. Makes room too, to cut. Can only jab it into the covers with a straight bat"
483,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs tossed up slow on leg stump, lovely use of the hands to reverse-paddle it into the fine third man region"
484,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run slow flight once again, outside off. Dhoni sees him shape for the reverse-sweep and moves a couple of steps to his right. And that enables him to deflect the ball away into the point region, off his pad. Could have gone really fine, possibly for four,"
485,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run length ball close to off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
486,"Jadhav to Stoinis, FOUR runs back of a length on off stump, makes room, and that's driven away brilliantly off the back foot, to the left of extra-cover. Didn't bounce much at all, but he watched it all the way and managed to swing freely through his shot"
487,"Shami to Handscomb, no run length ball, a bit of late swing in towards off stump. Shapes to drive through the off side initially. Checks his shot and it rolls to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
488,"Shami to Handscomb, FOUR runs full on middle stump, and that's a super shot from Handscomb, who's really showing off his 50-overs chops here. A step forward, and then he uses his wrists to flick it up and over midwicket"
489,"Shami to Handscomb, OUT what a glorious bit of fielding this is. Shami shortens his length slightly, gets it to tail back in slightly towards off stump. Handscomb presses half-forward, chops to the right of backward point, and calls his partner through for a quick single. Mistak"
490,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length outside off, slapped to the sweeper at deep point"
491,"Shami to Carey, no run very full, almost in the blockhole, on middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way and jabs into the covers"
492,"Shami to Carey, 1 wide back of a length, drifts down leg. Can't connect with the tuck off the hip"
493,"Shami to Carey, 2 runs length ball on middle and leg, and that's timed beautifully, clipped to the right of midwicket. Deep square leg has to run a long way to his right to stop that"
494,"Jadhav to Stoinis, FOUR runs flat, shortish, offers up some width, and Stoinis is really playing him well here. Steps back and across and slaps it between cover and extra-cover. Wrong line to bowl without a sweeper back on the fence"
495,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run flat length ball outside off, ends up leaving the batsman off the pitch - just carries on with the angle of drift. Slapped to extra-cover"
496,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length outside off, stabbed out to deep point"
497,"Jadhav to Carey, no run back of a length close to off stump, goes with the arm. Punched to short extra-cover"
498,"Jadhav to Carey, 1 run comes in with the arm again, cramps him for room as he goes back and across. Manages to punch it down the ground for a single to long-on"
499,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 2 runs dangled up super slow outside off. Stoinis is in position to reverse-paddle about two days before the ball arrives, and even Dhoni is in place, anticipating as always. Middles it nicely and picks up two well behind backward point"
500,"Bumrah to Carey, no run length ball angling in towards off stump. Gets half-forward and clips to mid-on"
501,"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run shortish outside off, nice wristwork at the top of the bounce to play that to the right of backward point, but Jadeja moves so quickly and throws himself at the ball, saves a couple more runs for his team"
502,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, punched back firmly to the bowler"
503,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run ooh, big angle in from Bumrah. Stoinis looks to stay leg-side of the ball and punch into the covers, only manages a thick inside edge into his pads. Rolls away slowly, square on the off side"
504,"Bumrah to Carey, no run back of a length, nipping in towards middle and off and cramping Carey for room. Defended towards short extra-cover"
505,"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run short, a bit of width, but deep point is in place and all Carey gets for his nice-looking cut is a single"
506,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run tossed up slow, turns from middle to off. Looks to sweep fine, but can only get some glove on it, and it rolls harmlessly for a few yards and stops"
507,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run bit of an appeal for lbw as he presses forward to defend this googly, bat and pad close together. Looks like pad first, but they don't review - not sure if it struck him in line"
508,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run wide stock ball, reaches out to stab it into the point region"
509,"Kuldeep to Carey, 2 runs tossed up slower and closer to off stump, swept away to deep square leg"
510,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run back of a length close to off stump, makes room and cuts it straight to backward point"
511,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run looped up on middle and leg, too full for the full-blooded sweep. Manages to drag it to deep backward square leg, off the bottom half of the bat"
512,"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, uses his wrists to whip it from off stump towards long leg"
513,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run full outside off, Stoinis plays a checked drive to short extra-cover"
514,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run length ball outside off, straightens off the seam to beat Stoinis' angled-bat drive. No footwork at all"
515,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length close to off stump, keeps a touch low. Defended into the covers"
516,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, angles this one sharply in towards leg stump. Extra bounce too, and Stoinis, looking to hurriedly jump and flick, is hit on the thigh pad"
517,"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run length ball close to off stump, stays back and eases the ball to the right of extra-cover"
518,"Kuldeep to Carey, FOUR runs shortish, spins away from off stump, rocks back and cuts it fiercely, behind square and a long way to the right of Vijay Shankar at sweeper cover. Big effort from the fielder there - a long sprint and a sprawling dive, but he can't quite keep it in"
519,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run again a touch short, this time the cut goes straight to backward point"
520,"Kuldeep to Carey, FOUR runs shot! Tossed up on off stump, and it's the stock ball. He clears his front leg and gets down low to slog-sweep it firmly, along the ground and against the turn, to the midwicket boundary"
521,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run short again, the amount of turn he gets forces him to reach for the ball, however, and hit it straighter than he'd strictly like. Slapped to the fielder at sweeper cover"
522,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, SIX runs shot! Australia needed a big over, and they're getting it against Kuldeep Yadav. Sees some flight and jumps down the track to launch this high and far, with the turn, over long-on"
523,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run tossed up full just outside off, too full to drive firmly, just about jabs it back to the bowler"
524,"Shami to Carey, 1 run shortish, cramps him with the angle in towards off stump. Chopped away to third man"
525,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, and some movement back in off the seam to beat Stoinis' inside edge as he looks to punch through mid-on/midwicket. Hits him on the back leg, and Shami goes up in appeal, but it's probably going over the top of the stumps, and definitely"
526,"Shami to Carey, 1 run full, angling into middle and off, clipped to long-on"
527,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, again gets some late movement, this time towards off stump, to cramp Stoinis. Pokes it into the cover point region to pick up one"
528,"Shami to Carey, 1 run short, sits up outside off, may have been the slower one. Pulled to deep midwicket"
529,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run low full-toss, tails in towards leg stump. Punched to long-on, shows the full face"
530,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs and he starts with a short ball dragged down outside off stump. Stoinis is seeing them very well here, and he cracks it away to the point boundary"
531,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, turns in towards the hip, worked away to deep square leg"
532,"Kuldeep to Carey, OUT he's conceding runs, but with Kuldeep Yadav a wicket is always round the corner. Wrong'un, floated up wide of off stump. Too full to sweep, and Carey only manages to drag it onto his stumps off the bottom edge"
533,"Kuldeep to Coulter-Nile, no run flighted ball pitching on middle stump and sliding on with the angle. Props forward and defends into the off side"
534,"Kuldeep to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs short outside off and Coulter-Nile slaps it up in the air, into the gap to the left of long-off"
535,"Kuldeep to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs flighted ball on off stump, Coulter-Nile goes for the big heave with the turn, and he doesn't connect all too cleanly but lands the ball in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket. Kuldeep ends with figures of 3 for 54."
536,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to steer towards third man"
537,"Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, OUT bowled him! Not the best shot from Coulter-Nile. He's been going after everything, and this is particularly risky, making room to try and cut Bumrah. That wicked angle does the rest, and there's no bat involved as the ball sneaks through and knocks ba"
538,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run full, angling in towards middle and leg. Keeps his pad out of the way and blocks it back to the bowler"
539,"Bumrah to Cummins, OUT lovely delivery, and there's a big appeal for a low catch behind. Dhoni thinks it's out. They're taking this upstairs, and the soft signal is out. Length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and it straightens off the pitch. Cummins pokes at it, gets a t"
540,"Bumrah to Lyon, no run back of a length, and again he angles it into the corridor and gets it to jag away off the seam. Lyon pushes at it and fails to put bat on ball"
541,"Bumrah to Lyon, no run ooh, again he gets it to straighten, this time from a fuller length and an off-stump line. Lyon is half-forward, and again he pushes inside the line, but gets a vital thick edge that sends the ball rolling down to third man"
542,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run full on off stump, clipped away to deep midwicket"
543,"Shami to Lyon, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to Jadhav at backward point. No run was available, and they weren't going for one, but Jadhav throws to the batsman's end anyway. Would have been okay if the midwicket fielder had backed up properly, but Rayudu fu"
544,"Shami to Stoinis, no run back of a length, nips back into off stump to cramp Stoinis for room. He simply blocks it back to the bowler"
545,"Shami to Stoinis, FOUR runs back of a length, and that's a super shot. Fifth-stump line, so not a particularly bad ball, but he waits, and uses his wrists brilliantly to open his bat face slightly and carve it to the left of the diving backward point fielder"
546,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, a little wider, chopped down to third man"
547,"Shami to Lyon, no run in the blockhole on middle stump, some late swing in as well - he's been getting the old ball to do that right through - and Lyon juuust gets his bat down in time to flick to long leg. Stoinis refuses the single, he wants the strike"
548,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run length ball angling in towards off stump, gets a nice stride in and defends it back down the pitch, solidly. Bumrah lets it run, willing Stoinis to take the single as mid-off ambles towards the ball. No way is Stoinis taking that single"
549,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended to extra-cover. Stoinis is doing the Dhoni thing here, rightly. The asking rate isn't all that steep even now"
550,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run in the blockhole, angling in towards off stump. Opens his bat face and squeezes it out to backward point"
551,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked solidly into the off side"
552,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run well, there's little he can do about this. The Bumrah special, angling into the corridor, pitching on a good length, straightening away, beating the outside edge as Stoinis presses forward, looking for a push into the off side"
553,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, angling into off stump. The one ball you might presume Bumrah might bowl. Stoinis shuffles across and nudges it away into the backward square leg region to retain strike. Once we know which way the result goes, this over could assume a"
554,"Shami to Stoinis, no run back of a length, angling into middle stump. Looks to make room to hit through the off side, can't find it. Punches it back to the bowler"
555,"Shami to Stoinis, 2 runs back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Steps across this time, whips it in the air, juuust out of reach of Kuldeep diving to his left and backwards at square leg, brings up his fifty"
556,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run length ball on off stump, shuffles across again to clip through square leg. Takes the single now, leaves Lyon three balls to keep out."
557,"Shami to Lyon, 1 run short outside off, makes a bit of room and slaps to deep point"
558,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run sees Stoinis looking to manufacture room and bowls a back-of-a-length ball angling into leg stump and cramping him for room. Swiped down to long-on, not much power on it"
559,"Shami to Lyon, FOUR runs full-toss, angling marginally down leg, and Lyon swings at it and gets a critical bit of bat on it. Fine leg was back, but he was too square, and this absolutely flies over the turf and gives him no chance"
560,"Shankar to Stoinis, OUT big appeal, and it's given! Immediate review too. Nowhere near short enough to pull, and not full enough to loft over mid-on, and he's caught between the two. It's angling in towards leg stump. Misses, and it hits him on the back leg. Looked out on first"
561,"Shankar to Zampa, 2 runs length ball on off stump, makes room and jabs into the point region. Backward point dives right and gets a hand to it, but it rolls away from him and they can run a second"
562,"Shankar to Zampa, OUT in the blockhole, and it's all over! He played a lovely innings at No. 5, and now he's bowled a great over under pressure. Full, straight, aiming at middle stump, and Zampa, making room to try and carve it away through point, fails to connect"
563,"9.28pm I may have mentioned this before, but what a match. T20 offers up a lot of tight finishes, but ODIs still give you room for these slow-burning thrills. It could have gone either way, and Virat Kohli could have gone either way - the low-slung offspin of Kedar Jadhav or the inexpe"
564,"9.45pm And that is that. India take a 2-0 lead in the series. Next up is Ranchi on Friday. Do join us for that, and keep sending in your comments. Until then, good night!"
