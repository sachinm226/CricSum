0,Toss Ricky Ponting has won the toss and decided to field. He reckons there is a bit of moisture in the pitch that will help his bowlers. A bit!
1,"Bracken to Tamim, no run Over the wicket, angling down leg, hint of swing, but that was just a loosener. Tamim tries to flick it but can't make contact. Slight appeal but that was going down leg."
2,"Bracken to Tamim, no run Starting from off this time. Again, not much swing. Tamim drives but can't get the timing right. Mistimed to mid-off"
3,"Bracken to Tamim, no run Slightly wide outside off, back of a length that time. Left alone"
4,"Bracken to Tamim, no run 82.1mph, good length this time, starting on off but ball not moving much yet. Tamim drives confidently but straight to Andrew Symonds at cover"
5,"Bracken to Tamim, 1 run This time on middle, fuller and Tamim doesn't hold back, goes for the drive and gets it past the bowler but Brad Hogg dives full length from mid-on and stops it. Keeps the batsmen down to a single"
6,"Bracken to Nafees, no run Back of a length and outside off, not that short but Nafees decides to go. Tries the pull but can't make contact. Bangladesh's openers have the energy about them. No fear, let's go"
7,"McGrath to Tamim, no run On the spot straight away. How does he do it? We've wondered that for many years. Left alone by Tamim."
8,"McGrath to Tamim, no run Oh! Back of a length and probing on off. Tamim pushes his front foot forward and watches as the ball clips the pad and goes through to the wicketkeeper. Caught in two minds there. McGrath thinks of an appeal but stops. Fine ball"
9,"McGrath to Tamim, no run Tamim tries to let loose. Back of a length but he's down the ground straight away. Meets the ball at a good length and lets rip a slash, can't find the gap and straight to cover."
10,"McGrath to Tamim, no run Hmm. Reckless or audacious? Down the ground again, starts too soon. Swings the bat and can't make contact. It's a good length ball outside off and Tamim missis it by a country mile"
11,"McGrath to Tamim, no run yorker. That was homing in on middle and leg. Tamim digs it out."
12,"McGrath to Tamim, 1 run slightly short from McGrath this time. Tamim gets on the back foot and clips it to the leg side for a quick single. Good start from McGrath"
13,"Bracken to Tamim, 1 run Full ball outside off, Tamim cover-drives but can't pierce the field again, slightly wide of cover and they manage a single"
14,"Bracken to Nafees, 1 run wide of off and back of a length, Shahriar has all the time to stay back and glide it to third man for a single"
15,"Bracken to Tamim, no run Back of a length, he tries to tip it to the off side and take off for a single. Woudl have been dangerous. Sent back"
16,"Bracken to Tamim, OUT Got 'em. Bracken takes the pace off the ball and drops it at a good length. Tamim on his knees and thinking of the slog sweep. Then he realises it's too wide and decides to go with the slap over the bowler's head. Can't get the timing yet again and only manages a tame catch to Brad Hogg at mid-off. One down."
17,"Bracken to Aftab, 3 runs Fine start, confident push down the ground. Classy start from Aftab. Full ball on off and he's balanced all the way, caressing it down the ground for three. Outfield expectedly slow. Hogg chases it down."
18,"Bracken to Nafees, no run Short ball and it's Nafees's chance to charge down the wicket. Gilchrist standing back this time. Nafees takes a massive swipe and misses. He seems to be missing his opening partner Tamim."
19,"McGrath to Aftab, no run Back of a length and outside off. On the money. Aftab pushes it to cover. Sensible so far but is it just a matter of time?"
20,"McGrath to Aftab, 1 run Straight and back of a length again. That McGrath length. Aftab gets a thick inside edge while trying to defend. The ball trickles to the leg side as they complete a single"
21,"McGrath to Nafees, OUT Touche! 132.3mph. That's No.55 for GD McGrath, equalling Wasim Akram's record for the most World Cup dismissals. Yorker homing in on middle stump. Too quick for Shahriar and was nailed all ends up. Plays all over it and loses his off stump. GD McGrath, take a bow!"
22,"McGrath to Shakib, 1 wide Has Halley's comet struck? A wide way down leg side from Mcgrath. Gilchrist dives full length and collects it."
23,"McGrath to Shakib, no run Rising bouncer this time. Left alone from Saqibul"
24,"McGrath to Shakib, no run yorker length outside off, driven to mid-off"
25,"McGrath to Shakib, no run back of a length and on the money. No Halley's comet, after all. Driven off the back foot to cover"
26,"Tait to Aftab, 1 wide Poor start. 146mph but full and swinging outside leg. Wide called. But he can pose a real threat with his pace"
27,"Tait to Aftab, no run Toe crusher this time. Swinging in from middle and into the block-hole for Aftab. He loses his balance after being hit on his feet. That was a scorcher"
28,"Tait to Aftab, FOUR runs Take that as a response. Back of a length and again drifting into leg, Aftab whips it in style and it races away behind square for a four. Now that's what I call a retort."
29,"Tait to Aftab, 3 runs Again, this time full and straight. Aftab swishes it over the infield. The outfield is desperately slow and they can only get three. That deserved more. It's not slogging but all correct cricket."
30,"Tait to Shakib, SIX runs Saqibul joins the party. Short and wide outside off, Nafees swings hard, real hard. It flies off the thickish edge and steeples to the third man fence. Bounces on the rope. Maximum"
31,"Tait to Shakib, no run Short ball. 152mph. Better directed this time. Saqibul on the back foot and gets behind the line. Drops it close to his body. Good technique there."
32,"Tait to Shakib, 1 run Full and wide, has a go at it. They are going for them now, they have to. Races to third man for a single"
33,"McGrath to Shakib, no run Back of a length and straight. Defended confidently back to the bowler."
34,"McGrath to Shakib, 1 run Straighter and drifting down leg, Saqibul flicks it for a single behind square leg"
35,"McGrath to Aftab, OUT Catch! You beauty! Back of a length on off, Aftab down the track and tries to drive over mid-off but can't get the timing. Just like Tamim. It appears to have the elevation to beat mid-off but, Oh, look who's there. Nathan Bracken times his jump perfectly and latches on to the ball while in mid-air. You specy! McGrath becomes the"
36,"McGrath to Ashraful, 1 run How cute was that? Good length outside off, Ashraful moves across the off stump, takes a walk almost, and tries to cutely scoop it to fine leg. No timing, no placement. It goes way in the air, before landing just short of a forward running backward square leg. Reckless? You bet"
37,"McGrath to Shakib, no run driven straight to cover. Saqibul seems to be playing this sensibly but that's exactly what we said about Aftab and Shahriar."
38,"McGrath to Shakib, no run Defended on the back foot towards short midwicket"
39,"Tait to Ashraful, 1 wide Full and angling down leg. Ashraful again tries the sweep-paddle-scoop shot. He's come in with a plan but it's proving a bit risky at the moment."
40,"Tait to Ashraful, no run Straight and full and Ashraful meets it with the full face of the bat. For the first time in his innings. Driven crisply to mid-on. No run, though."
41,"Tait to Ashraful, 1 wide Tait down leg again. He's not got his direction right. Speedy though. Ashraful swings but can't make contact"
42,"Tait to Ashraful, 1 run Full and outside off, well played by Ashraful, driven wide of mid-off for a quick single."
43,"Tait to Shakib, 2 runs Seven fielders on the off and Tait bowls it full on leg. Saqib only needs to clip it off his pads for an easy two. That was slightly behind square"
44,"Tait to Shakib, no run Quick again, back of a length and outside off, punched off the back foot to cover"
45,"Tait to Shakib, no run Wide of off, Saqib gets the room to swish and he goes for it but can't make contact. Tait is racy here. He's bowling at around 150kph, and not mph as I had mentioned earlier. Now that would be unreal."
46,"Tait to Shakib, 2 runs Short ball, goes for the pull. Ball gets high on him, hits the top part of his bat and drops well wide of Hogg at mid-on. The second run was a tight one but Hogg was wayward with his throw"
47,"McGrath to Ashraful, no run Back of a length, defended off the back foot. Man stationed in the deep for the pull"
48,"McGrath to Ashraful, FOUR runs Backs away and flays. Good length ball outside off and Ashraful nonchalantly thwacks it over the off-side ring for a four. Good afternoon, Mr McGrath"
49,"McGrath to Ashraful, no run Tries the paddle again but that's too wide of off and too full to go for that. He changes his shot in the last minute and taps it to the off side."
50,"McGrath to Ashraful, no run full ball, almost yorker length and Ashraful digs it out. Down the ground to mid-on"
51,"McGrath to Ashraful, OUT Goodbye Mr Ashraful. Slow delivery from the master. Good length on off and tempting, very tempting. Ashraful makes room again and tries to clear mid-on but is deceived by the pace. Ball soars high in the air, Ponting back-peddles and takes a well-judged catch. McGrath's spell reads 3.5-0-9-3. Bread and butter for Pidge"
52,"McGrath to Shakib, no run Full and slow again, nice testing delivery. Saqibul pushes tamely to the cover."
53,"Symonds to Shakib, 1 run punched down to mid-on"
54,"Symonds to Habibul Bashar, no run full and straight, spin in tandem now. Flicked to midwicket, Hodge moves across and cuts it off very well"
55,"Symonds to Habibul Bashar, 1 run punched to mid-on. Easily done"
56,"Symonds to Shakib, 1 run Bit quicker, straight too, Saqibul pushes it to mid-on for another single"
57,"Symonds to Habibul Bashar, 1 wide Quick and fired down leg side, Basher almost overbalances and Gilchrist collects it well and snaps off the bails. Fine work there. Appeal goes up for a stumping but the umpire is calling a wide. No need for the third umpire"
58,"Symonds to Habibul Bashar, no run"
59,"Symonds to Habibul Bashar, no run punched down to mid-on, Hodge again cuts it off"
60,"Hogg to Shakib, 1 run lofted over cover for a single"
61,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 1 run full and outside off, punched to mid-off"
62,"Hogg to Shakib, 1 run Full toss, that didn't come out well but Saqib can't get the timing right. Sweeps it straight to deep square for a single. It was predemidated and he didn't expect the full toss"
63,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, no run"
64,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 1 run dropped dlightly short and Basher rocks back and cuts it away to deep point"
65,"Hogg to Shakib, no run Gives it a bit of air, Saqib down the track and drives but straight back to the bowler. The two Australian spinners are doing a good job here"
66,"Tait to Habibul Bashar, no run Starts off with a 145kph. Full and straight. Driven down the ground by Basher, back to the bowler"
67,"Tait to Habibul Bashar, 1 run Slowly cranking it up. Full again and starting outside off and swinging in. Basher goes for the drive but an inside edge richochets off his pads and trickles to the off side. They scamper a quick single"
68,"Tait to Shakib, 1 run Gives himself room and slaps it to cover. Tait keeping it full and straight. He's getting a hint of swing as well. Better start to his second spell than his first"
69,"Tait to Habibul Bashar, 1 run Similar delivery, Basher goes across the line but again gets an inside edge that deviates off the pads to third man. Single again"
70,"Tait to Shakib, no run This is a good length and line. Gettiing pacier by the ball. Driven to cover by Saqib but can't pierce the field."
71,"Tait to Shakib, 1 run Right in the blockhole this time. Saqib gives himself room but only digs it out and drives down the ground to long-off for a single. Good return for Tait"
72,"Hogg to Shakib, 1 run Saw him charging down the track and held it back. Saqib was forced to tap it to the off side and complete a single"
73,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, no run dropped. Dipping full toss and Basher down the ground and tries to loft it over the fielder. Can't get the timing and hits it straight back. Hogg goes for the return catch but muffs it after getting his hand to it. Not the easiest of catches but Hogg is usually good off his own bowling"
74,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 1 run"
75,"Hogg to Shakib, 1 run Second full toss of the over, Saqib sweeps it away for a single"
76,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, no run"

81,"Watson to Habibul Bashar, 2 runs Full and slightly slow. 71mph Driven confidently between the cover fielders for a brace"
82,"Watson to Habibul Bashar, no run Full and swinging in. Basher tries to flick it but it's a bit too quick. Gets an inside edge and goes on to deflect off the pads. Watson gets excited with an appeal but that seemed to hit the bat"
83,"Watson to Habibul Bashar, no run defended off the front foot, thick inside edge that almost went back onto the stumps. Habibul didn't have much clue about that"
84,"Hogg to Shakib, no run Full ball on middle, sweeps straight to the fielder at backward square leg"
85,"Hogg to Shakib, no run driven off the back foot, straight to cover"

89,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 1 run tapped to short cover and scamper a quick single. Symonds is prowling there but he can't cut off the run"
90,"Tait to Shakib, no run Full and straight again. You miss, I hit, he seems to be saying. Saqib makes room and slashes it to cover, can't beat the field."
91,"Tait to Shakib, OUT Nailed 'em. Wide and full of off stump, 90mph. Saqib goes for the drive but can only get a thick edge. Easy take by Gilchrist behind the stumps. Not Tait's best delivery today but as it happens, produces a wicket. He's come back well in the second spell."
92,"Tait to Mortaza, no run Full, almost yorker length. Digs it out towards midwicket and takes of for a single. Sent back by his non-striker. Ponting swoops down and goes for the direct hit. Had it hit, it would have been all over. Luckily for him, Ponting misses."
93,"Tait to Mortaza, no run Slightly wide but full. Mashrafe makes room and goes for the swat. Too fast for him, though. He's not going to be hanging around."
94,"Tait to Mortaza, 1 run clipped away a full one to midwicket for a single."
95,"Tait to Habibul Bashar, 1 wide That's the Tait we saw in the first spell. Way down the leg side and giving Gilchrist a big challenge."
96,"Tait to Habibul Bashar, no run Good swing that time. Full and outside off. Basher makes room but can't make contact. Bangladesh's batsmen trying to make too much room. Missing regularly. Last four overs have produced just 13 runs."
97,"Hogg to Mortaza, 1 run Another full toss. This time a high one. Mashrafe pulls it away to deep square for a single. None of the full tosses have been given the treatment they deserved"
98,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 1 run down the ground, lofted to extra cover for a single"
99,"Hogg to Mortaza, 1 run Driven forcefully down the ground. That was a quick, full ball. McGrath mis-fields but he recovers quickly to keep them down to one."
100,"Hogg to Habibul Bashar, 2 runs wrong one from Hogg. Swept but can only manage the top edge to fine leg. Complete a handy couple"

114,"Hogg to Shakib, 1 run driven to cover for a single"

116,"Bracken to Mortaza, 1 run Full and angling into leg stump, flicked away for a single to square leg"
117,"Bracken to Habibul Bashar, 1 run Slow ball, angling into middle. Basher tries to go across the line but is deceived by the change of pace and gets an inside edge, onto his pads and gets a single"
118,"Bracken to Mortaza, 1 run Full ball on middle, Mashrafe backs away and thumps it to wide long-off for a single. Can't get the elevation because it's so full"

125,"McGrath to Habibul Bashar, 1 run Straight and full. Punched away from the crease, wide of mid-on for a single"

139,"Bracken to Mushfiqur, 1 run Finishes with a slower one. Single to cover to end the innings."
140,"So Bangladesh have managed 104 for 6 in their 22 overs. They tried to go after the bowling from the word go and lost wickets in the process. Glenn McGrath led the way in his metronomic style while the spinners chipped in well later on. All six wickets were taken by the faster bowlers, though, Australia should not have much of a problem overhauling this. Join"
141,Welcome back for Australia's chase. They need 105. Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist are making their way out to join the rest in the middle. Mashrafe Mortaza has the ball in his hands.

148,"Baisya to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Over the wicket, angling it away from Gilchrist. On the front foot and eased away through extra cover. The outfield is slow but the shot has enough timing to fetch four. The cover fielder is a bit too late to reach it"

150,"Baisya to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Dropped. Superb ball from Baisya. Pitched back of a length on off and moved away fter pitching.

175,"Baisya to Hayden, SIX runs That's a scorcher down the ground. Hayden picks it up from a good length and lofts if way over mid-on for a six. Clean hit. Hayden can be brutal with those"
176,"Baisya to Hayden, 1 run full toss. Hayden pushes it to mid-off and completes a quick single. Tapash Baisya seems to have pulled a muscle there. He's in trouble. Hayden goes up to him and enquires what's wrong. He appears in some trouble. Second casualty of the match, after Shane Watson earlier left the field with a calf strain?"
