268,"So Southee and Vettori combine to skittle out Australia for 231 after losing the toss. Australia will look back at the innings with a lot of regret because some of their main batters threw it away - Watson, Ponting, Clarke and to a lesser extent, Katich. Having said that, the bowlers were consistent and kept the pressure on and didn't let any"
269,"The Australia huddle is on. We will have about 13 overs today, the light should hold. 3 slips and a forward short leg in place"

274,"Bollinger to McIntosh, no run full in length outside off and defended to the off side"
275,"Bollinger to McIntosh, OUT McIntosh had no idea where his off stump was!

276,"Harris to Watling, 1 run defended to mid-on for a quick single"

523,"Harris to Taylor, 1 run tips and runs, wide of mid-on"

560,"Johnson to Taylor, FOUR runs that's the fastest Test century by a New Zealander! short and wide, and cuts it, not bothering about keeping it down, and it nearly flies all the way for six to third man boundary, from where the NZ women's hockey team is watching.

589,"Hauritz to Taylor, 1 run Watson is brilliant at deep midwicket, and gets a generous applause too... slog-swept, Watson takes the catch at the edge of the boundary, to his right, and it is very difficult to keep his balance as both feet are in the air when he catches it, but before falling over he throws the ball back in play"
590,"Hauritz to Patel, 1 run worked around the corner for one"
591,"Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs what a strike, slog-swept from way outside off, and Watson has no chance of catching this, they have lost the ball behind midwicket, big six"

614,"Bollinger to Southee, no run wide outside off, and left alone"
615,"Bollinger to Southee, 1 run pitched up on the pads, Southee plays the shot too early, and the leading edge falls wide of the widish mid-off"
616,"Bollinger to Taylor, OUT review, Taylor goes for the boundary with the field up, goes for the pull shot, the ball is too full, Aussies appeal for a bottom edge, Asad Rauf doesn't move. Hot spot shows a faint tickle as the ball passes the bat, and Rauf overturns his decision"
617,"Johnson to Southee, FOUR runs whipped away off the pads, and more clumsy fielding from Bollinger at fine leg, he comes around, bends slowly, pulls it in, and then kicks it over - he didn't intend to do so, mind you"
618,"Johnson to Southee, no run Southee is going for it, pulls and misses"
619,"Johnson to Southee, 1 run and Southee takes the single, bunting it to cover"

630,"Johnson to Arnel, 1 run on the pads, and he tucks it away to fine leg"
631,"Johnson to Southee, 2 runs and Southee looks to clear them, that takes some thinking, short ball and he toe-ends the pull, which lands short of all leg-side fielders"
632,"Johnson to Southee, no run angled across him, and he is beaten as he looks to push it to cover"
633,"Johnson to Southee, FOUR runs long-on has come to a three-fourths position after that earlier miss, and Southee has driven this length ball powerfully enough to beat him"
634,"Johnson to Southee, no run and Johnson keeps his at that end with a sharp bouncer, aimed at his chest, he fends but can't take a single"

642,"Johnson to Southee, no run slower ball, 133ks, is beaten outside off, the edge wouldn't have carried if he had managed one here"
643,"Johnson to Southee, 1 run short outside off, and he bunts into covers and runs"
644,"Johnson to Arnel, 2 runs this is an even better shot from Arnell than the boundary in the last over, gets the front close to the line, and push-drives through covers"
645,"Johnson to Arnel, no run this is better from Johnson, short and into the ribs, hits him in the glove but that hand is off the bat, and it doesn't carry anyway"
646,"Harris to Southee, 1 run Southee gets an inside edge onto pad and he is looking for two but Harris is quick to run towards midwicket and keep them down to one"
