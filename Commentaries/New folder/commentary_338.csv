12,"Siddle to Trott, no run starts on a length, defended back to the bowler"

15,"Siddle to Trott, no run gets outside off, Trott onto the front foot and defends"
16,"Siddle to Trott, no run better from Siddle, on middle and off but not so full, Trott defends on the walk"

21,"Starc to Root, no run full and angling in towards off stump, almost a one-day type of delivery from Starc, and Root keeps it out"
22,"Starc to Root, FOUR runs well played Joe Root, he gets some width from Starc and it's short enough for the batsman to cut hard and straight down into the ground, it runs away behind point for a boundary"
23,"Starc to Root, no run Root comes forward to meet this delivery, which is wide of off, and he drives but can't beat the field"
24,"Siddle to Trott, FOUR runs Siddle draws an edge from Trott but it's safely down into the ground and runs away between the slips and gully for a boundary"
25,"Siddle to Trott, 2 runs too leg-side-ish from Siddle now and Trott clips it through midwicket, Hughes is there but he fumbles and it costs Australia a couple of runs"
26,"Siddle to Trott, no run straight again from Siddle, no real movement, and Trott works it to mid-on"

36,"Siddle to Root, no run Siddle gets some outswing now but Root is good enough to cover it and pushes it firmly to the off side"

40,"Siddle to Root, no run swinging away from outside off but it's too far outside - left alone"
41,"Siddle to Root, FOUR runs another loose ball releases any pressure as Root clips it off his pads and through midwicket, a diving attempt in the deep from Pattinson can't prevent this from reaching the boundary"

49,"Siddle to Root, no run again Siddle angles it in and Root defends"
50,"Siddle to Root, no run outside off, no real movement, and Root defends again. Siddle's radar is improving a little now"

52,"Siddle to Trott, (no ball) left alone outside off"
53,"Siddle to Trott, 1 run Siddle slips this one down leg and it's clipped away by Trott"

61,"Pattinson to Trott, no run good line outside off and it's left alone"

63,"Pattinson to Trott, no run well wide of off, Trott leaves it alone"
64,"Pattinson to Trott, no run a little bit of tail in there from Pattinson, it's fullish and on off stump, Trott drives it back towards the bowler"
65,"Pattinson to Trott, no run left alone outside off"
66,"Pattinson to Trott, no run very straight from Pattinson, very straight bat from Trott"
67,"Siddle to Root, OUT got him! The yorker does the job! Siddle gets his line right first ball from this end and the length is spot-on as well. Perhaps just a little hint of swing away and Root plays the wrong line, losing his off stump."
68,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run again Siddle gets the ball to swing away a little bit, and late, and Pietersen edges it down towards the finer of the two gullies"
69,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run another good ball, curving away a fraction, and it's pushed to point"
70,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run wider and shorter, and moving away off the seam now instead of in the air. Pietersen is not interested"
71,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run edgy from Pietersen, this one angles in and he turns it towards leg, but not off the meat of the bat at all"
72,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen gets off the mark with a nudge through off, but again there was some late swing from Siddle"
73,"Pattinson to Pietersen, no run Pattinson also gets the ball to move away, but it's too wide to tempt Pietersen into playing"
74,"Pattinson to Pietersen, FOUR runs oooh, is that a chance for Haddin? Yes - a very tough one though! Pattinson swings it down leg, Pietersen glances fine off the face of the bat and Haddin has to dive a long way to his left. The thing is, he actually made his ground but the ball died on him and went under his gloves. Would have been a m"

76,"Pattinson to Pietersen, no run Haddin has had some work to do this over, dives across in front of first slip to clutch a very wide ball from Pattinson"
77,"Pattinson to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off, a bit straighter from Pattinson"
78,"Pattinson to Pietersen, no run woah! What a brave leave from Pietersen. Must not have missed off stump by much, I wonder if he expected it to swing away - in fact it just held its line"
79,"Starc to Trott, no run swings down leg side"
80,"Starc to Trott, no run full and straight, Trott keeps it out easily"
81,"Starc to Trott, no run some inswing from Starc, but he started this one a little too far to leg and Trott gets an inside edge onto pad"
82,"Starc to Trott, no run wrong line from Starc, down leg side and Trott doesn't get anything on it"
83,"Starc to Trott, no run that's an exceptionally ambitious appeal from Starc. It starts down leg and swings further down, but the Australians still ask the lbw question."

90,"Pattinson to Pietersen, 1 leg bye another easy single worked away behind square leg"
91,"Starc to Pietersen, no run hesitant from Pietersen! Full and swinging in, KP pushes to point and wants a single, but Trott doesn't. Pietersen definitely appeared to want to be down the other end"

135,"Watson to Trott, no run fuller, swinging away, left alone"
136,"Watson to Trott, no run almost a mistake from Trott as he throws his bat at a very wide, full delivery which comes off the toe end towards point"

152,"Pattinson to Bell, no run just outside off, that's where he's not been consistently enough, and left alone"
153,"Pattinson to Bell, no run edged! But falls well short of Watson at first slip. Seemed to loop, rather than spring, off the outside edge. Has been some variable carry today"

240,"Siddle to Prior, OUT Siddle has five! That's not his best ball of the day, but Prior has authored his own downfall with a terrible shot. Short and wide outside off, Prior's eyes have lit up and he's gone the big cut but straight to the man at point. It's Phil Hughes, and he takes the catch above his head."

247,"Starc to Broad, no run Starc is searching just outside off, hoping for an edge, Broad gets it away to point but an edge is not out of the question here"

249,"Starc to Broad, no run full and straight, Broad pushes it back to Starc"
250,"Starc to Broad, no run bouncer again, but this one is too high and outside off, easily left alone by Broad"
251,"Siddle to Bairstow, no run full and wide of off, Siddle is still getting some outswing, Bairstow probably should have left that in the last over before tea but he nibbled at it, just ended up pushing it away to point"

255,"Siddle to Bairstow, no run angled in and then swinging away, defended to mid-off"
256,"Siddle to Bairstow, no run good ball to finish, forcing the batsman to play on off stump, and it's punched back to Siddle"

264,"Starc to Bairstow, no run pushed across wide outside off, left alone"
265,"Starc to Bairstow, 1 run keeping it very full, tucked into space at midwicket"
266,"Starc to Broad, 2 runs in the air, driven off the back foot and he doesn't keep it down but finds space between cover and mid-off"
267,"Starc to Broad, FOUR runs short again, and Broad plays this cleverly going with the bounce and carving it over the slips down to third man"
268,"Starc to Broad, 1 run whips a full delivery from around middle stump out to deep square to keep the strike"
269,"Pattinson to Broad, no run that's a quick bouncer, 86mph, and gets Broad in a bit of a tangle as it flies off his shoulder towards gully...Broad wasn't watching that very closely"
270,"Pattinson to Broad, no run stays in line, punched off the back foot to cover"
271,"Pattinson to Broad, FOUR runs flayed! Frees is arms again and takes advantage of a full delivery without quite the previous venom and unfurls a thunderous cover drive...200 up for England"
272,"Pattinson to Broad, no run now a play and a miss...Broad aiming another big drive, misses out the edge and Haddin fumbles as well"
273,"Pattinson to Broad, no run this time it's a fantastic take by Haddin, diving down the leg side as this one swings past Broad's pads and it kept moving"

275,"Starc to Bairstow, no run full on middle and off, driven neatly by Bairstow but mid-off skips around"
276,"Starc to Bairstow, no run comes forward again, Starc keeping it full, drives off a thick inside edge to midwicket"
277,"Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs short and wide, Bairstow cashes in by going over the top of point...always his intent to go in the air. There hasn't been much for short today"
278,"Starc to Bairstow, no run back on a full length outside off, good carry to Haddin"
279,"Starc to Bairstow, no run nearly drags on, trying to force this away through the off side it comes off the bottom edge into his pads"

282,"Pattinson to Broad, FOUR runs nicely played, more good timing from Broad as he punches this straight down the ground with enough power to beat mid-on"

284,"Pattinson to Broad, no run banged in short, comes fairly gently off the surface and defends square on the off side"
285,"Pattinson to Broad, OUT all the good work undone. A bit dim from Broad who gets sucked in by a short ball which he top edges and Pattinson himself steadies under the catch on the on side"
286,"Pattinson to Swann, no run full and wide to Swann first ball, left alone and bounces twice to Haddin"
287,"Starc to Bairstow, OUT castled! Now it's reward for Starc. Full at off stump, Bairstow plays around it and the pole flies backwards. Wasn't quite a yorker, Bairstow closed the face as he aimed for the leg side. Had played straight for so much of his innings"
288,"Starc to Finn, OUT first ball! Playing away from his body, edges through to Haddin. Finn reviews, thinking he has hit the ground, but replays quickly confirmed the nick."

290,"Starc to Anderson, no run angled into the pads, loops to the leg side"
291,"Starc to Anderson, no run bouncer, very short, Anderson barely has to duck"
292,"Starc to Anderson, no run big appeal for lbw, given not out and Clarke reviews. Sounded like an edge. In fact, it's two pads and this will be close...ooh, close! Umpires call on hitting, just taken the outside of leg so stays on field"
293,"Pattinson to Swann, 1 run short, angled into the body, Swann tucks it into the square-leg area and is happy to take the single"

297,"Pattinson to Swann, no run back of a length, defended back down the pitch"
298,"Pattinson to Swann, OUT that's a pretty fitting way to end the innings, Swann just prods a catch to cover from a short of a length delivery that he poked at with no intent at all"
299,"So it's just 215 on the board for England. Way below what they will have wanted. The only silver lining for them at the moment is that the cloud cover is still around so they have to make that count this evening. It's been a wonderful day, so for, for Australia, led by Peter Siddle. The bowling wasn't always consistent, but they produced some"

308,"Finn to Watson, no run decent yorker, well dug out"

322,"Finn to Rogers, 1 run tip and run to short midwicket, Rogers has to get his skates on and the throw bounces over the stumps as he sprawls in the dirt"
323,"Anderson to Rogers, 1 run angled across, touch full and steered in front of point for a single"
324,"Anderson to Clarke, OUT oh, bowled him, that's a peach of a delivery from Anderson! Unplayable covers it but that ball deserves a few more words in homage. It was on a length, curving in to pitch on off stump and then shape back past Clarke's outside edge as he groped forward, the ball kissing the top of off and gently dislodging the ba"

341,"Finn to Smith, no run another jaffa, like Finn's first delivery to Clarke, hitting the seam and jagging past the outside edge as Smith thrust his bat into his front pad - England all go up due to the sound but Aleem Dar is unmoved, rightly so"

350,"Anderson to Rogers, no run gets across and chops defensively into the off side"
351,"Anderson to Rogers, FOUR runs that's a beauty, Rogers trying to whip it to leg and getting a thick edge wide of the diving Root at third slip, it was very full and shaping late back towards off stump - little bit of luck for the batsman but openers are entitled to that"

373,"Anderson to Rogers, OUT speared in and hit in front, Rogers again pulled across his stumps ... up goes Dharmasena's finger but Rogers reviews! The angle was quite exaggerrated but this only has to be clipping and Hawk Eye suggests it was, Rogers has to drag himself away! Anderson's hard work in probing outside off pays off as Rogers fe"

411,"Anderson to Hughes, no run padded away! Hughes lunges forward and thrusts his front leg at the ball, it was wide enough to risk, though, Anderson and the England team go up in appeal but umpire Dharmasena isn't interested.

456,"Anderson to Smith, OUT drives at this and edges it behind where did that come from? I think it moved a little and look a thin edge to Prior. From looking gun-barrel straight in the preceding overs this morning, this has just shaped a little away from Smith driving, admittedly a touch loosely outside off stump, he got a feather edge and"

This time it left the right-hander a little, Siddle followed it outside off stump and Prior took off and claimed it very well a full stretch down to his right-hand side. Mastery of swing"
468,"Anderson to Starc, no run length ball, strikes the hip and runs towards square leg"
469,"Anderson to Starc, no run very full just outside off stump, driven and gets it to extra cover without timing"
470,"Anderson to Starc, no run full just outside off, pushed at and dropped at second slip that is a dolly shelled by Graeme Swann. Simple as you like down low with two hands and it bounced straight out, a rarity indeed but that was poor"

484,"Swann to Hughes, 1 leg bye swept from off stump, struck on the back pad, huge lbw appeal, not out given, no review and Hawk Eye has it hitting just outside the line and going over too, good decision"
485,"Swann to Pattinson, no run a lunge outside off stump, the turn away from the bat beats him"
486,"Swann to Pattinson, no run back on his stumps, another huge cry for lbw, not out given again, this was probably sliding down leg"
487,"Swann to Pattinson, OUT gone this time though, played forward and given out lbw struck on the front pad bang in front and the arm ball has done the trick. Pattinson has reviewed but it's in vain surely, yep that's smashing leg stump and there was no inside edge. Swann beating the inside edge this time and Pattinson is a goner"
488,"Swann to Agar, no run defended solidly to the off side"
489,"Swann to Agar, 1 run tossed up outside off and Agar drives through cover for a single, the fielder ensures there won't be two there"

492,"Anderson to Agar, no run again Anderson makes him play, again Agar defends"
