,Data
0,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run good length ball on off stump, slower in pace too, knocked into the off side for a quick single"
1,"Sharma to Maxwell, SIX runs backs away and slams a short ball over deep point's head. Wonder if he just wanted to test himself against the longer boundary down there"
2,"Sharma to Maxwell, no run full on off stump, sliced to mid-off"
3,"Sharma to Maxwell, no run loads up for the reverse swat way too early and Mohit has enough time to change plans and bowl a back of the hand slower ball. Beats the batsman easily"
4,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run his attempt to make room was spotted as well, but he is still able to reach the wide full toss and squeeze it to deep point"
5,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run shortish and outside off, slammed away through the off side"
6,"Axar Patel to Marsh, 1 run flatter delivery on middle and leg, pushed through to long-on"
7,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, FOUR runs creamed over extra cover! A little shimmy outside leg to pummel a length ball over the infield. Such brute force"
8,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, FOUR runs resorts to his favourite slog sweep again to pick up a similar length ball, on a similar line and dispatches it over square leg. Talk about a range of strokes!"
9,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run moves outside leg, but once the fuller, faster ball was speared into his pads, he switches up and slogs it to long-on"
10,"Axar Patel to Marsh, 1 bye moves over to off stump to try and open up the leg side, but the fuller ball slides past his reach and becomes byes as Dhoni fails to connect"
11,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, SIX runs bang! Lands into the crowd behind long-on. A bit short, Maxi made his own room to free those hands and trusted his power."
12,"Shami to Cummins, 1 run dug in shortish and outside off, Haddin rides the bounce and steers it down to third man to tick over the strike"
13,"Shami to Johnson, no run on a good length and on middle and leg, Johnson aims for a whippy stroke, but can only block it back to Shami"
14,"Shami to Johnson, FOUR runs banged in short on the leg stump, Johnson does not get hold of the pull. However, he manages a top edge that flies over Dhoni"
15,"Shami to Johnson, 1 run good length ball on middle, Johnson clubs it away to deep midwicket"
16,"Shami to Cummins, 1 run speared in very full on middle and leg, Haddin squirts it to the legisde"
17,"Shami to Johnson, no run"
18,"Yadav to Cummins, 1 run Umesh strays on the pads, tucked in front of square on the leg-side"
19,"Yadav to Johnson, 1 run Johnson slithers away and makes room, but the bowler follows him with a full ball outside leg. Mistimed behind square leg"
20,"Yadav to Cummins, no run"
21,"Yadav to Cummins, no run back of a length and climbs over the stumps as Cummins swings and misses"
22,"Yadav to Cummins, 1 run dropped and Raina is the culprit. Cummins aims for a mighty pull to the legside, but only manages a top edge that balloons in the air. Raina tries to cup his fingers around it, but the ball hits his chest and spills down"
23,"Yadav to Johnson, 1 run"
24,"Shami to Johnson, OUT that's a slower short ball and Johnson goes for the pull, ends up getting a top edge that swirls to Mohit at long leg"
25,"Shami to Cummins, OUT Australia have been bowled out for 371. Shami spears in a fast yorker, Cummins misses and the ball hits the base of middle. Shami smile might as well translate to you-miss-and-I-hit"
26,"Led by Warner and Maxwell, Australia have posted a massive score. The two batsmen unleashed some outrageous shots on their way to centuries. The pitch is still good for batting and India will fancy their chances of chasing it down."
27,Pat Cummins comes on now.
28,"Cummins to Jadeja, no run short ball angling away from Jadeja, who misses the pull. It may have been a slower ball too"
29,"Cummins to Jadeja, 2 runs back of a length outside off, Jadeja stands tall and punches it away to the left of sweeper cover"
30,"Cummins to Jadeja, FOUR runs full now, a bit of width outside off, and he frees his arms to flat-bat that powerfully down the ground, between the non-striker and mid-off"
31,"Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run short now, and he drags the pull from outside off, head height, and controls it well to play it downwards towards the deep midwicket boundary"
32,"Cummins to Rayudu, no run what happened there? Rayudu popped up what seemed like a dolly, the short ball getting big on him as he looked to pull, and Smith at short midwicket simply didn't go for it, shielding his eyes instead. I think he lost the ball in the floodlights"
33,"Cummins to Rayudu, 5 wide another short ball, this one's wayward, down the leg side and too high for Haddin, and it runs away for five wides"
34,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 run short again, angling into Rayudu, who makes room and opens his bat face to dink it away towards third man"
35,"Hazlewood to Rayudu, no run down the track now, and he clears his front leg and aims a big swipe down the ground, but doesn't quite middle it and it rolls along slowly towards mid-on"

43,"Cummins to Jadeja, 2 runs full outside off and Jadeja clears his front leg and slices hard underneath the ball, hits it in the air and it drops down and stops near the deep point boundary"
44,"Cummins to Ashwin, 1 wide banged in short, loses his line somewhat, angles down the leg side"
45,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run short ball outside off, and it lifts disconcertingly into the keeper's gloves, high above his head, after Ashwin aims a speculative poke at it"
46,"Starc to Axar Patel, no run short, rising ball, angling into Axar, who gets on his toes to block into the off side"
47,"Starc to Axar Patel, 1 run full outside off and he gets on the front foot to drive to sweeper cover"
48,"Starc to Ashwin, no run full on off stump, almost in the blockhole, and Ashwin goes back and across to block it back to the bowler"
49,"Starc to Ashwin, 1 leg bye another yorker, swinging down the leg side, perhaps. Pings Ashwin on the foot as he looks to flick, and runs away towards fine leg"
50,"Starc to Axar Patel, 1 run short outside off, and he steers it away to third man"
51,"Starc to Ashwin, no run another yorker, this is excellent bowling, and Ashwin can't do anything more than block to mid-on"

56,"Hazlewood to Axar Patel, no run back of a length on middle stump, and Axar blocks back towards the bowler"
57,"Hazlewood to Axar Patel, no run back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
58,"Hazlewood to Axar Patel, no run full and wide and it beats Axar, who presses forward and aims a drive with an angled bat"
59,"That start he said had a lot to do with Warner's rapid ton as well. It was a beautiful batting pitch, India helped out by being a bit wayward and 371 proved a bit beyond them once the middle order failed to show up. Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu hit attractive fifties and runs under their belts will help India moving forward. But again, no one went on and they rack up another defeat on this tour to Australia. Thank you for your company tonight, we'll be back tomorrow morning same time for the next set of warm-up matches."
60,Australia won by 106 runs
