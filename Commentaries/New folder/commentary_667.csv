549,"Thats all we have for you today, folks, but do join us for our continued live coverage of the third match of this tri-series, between England and New Zealand at this same venue, on Tuesday, January 16. This is Jamie Alter, also on behalf of my co-commentator, Binoy George, signing off and saying thanks for tuning in. Cheers, all!"
550,Symonds is the Man of the Match for his allround efforts.
551,"Ricky Ponting has given another consummate profession display from his bowlers and fielders, and he rotated the changes well, as we saw with the options of Mitchell Johnson, Cameron White, and Symonds. In all, it was the usual story we've seen for much of the past few seasons - Australian dominance."

Ross Taylor played another mature innings for his young age, battling with cramps in his left leg, but a lack of support from his teammates ultimately ruined New Zealand's chances of getting close to their target. Its shocking that only two other batsman made it to double figures, and this is an"
