0,"Hello and welcome to the last match of the Super Eights. It's West Indies and Australia in St Lucia, and the news from the middle is West Indies have won the toss and elected to bat."
1,"Nannes to Gayle, 1 wide full, swinging and wide of off stump, too wide, says the umpire"
2,"Nannes to Gayle, FOUR runs strong start from Gayle, he gets a half-volley and sends a punchy drive back past the bowler for four"
3,"Nannes to Gayle, OUT oh dear! He's gone! Angled in and this ball doesn't swing at all, and rattles Gayle's stumps. The ball jagged back a little off the seam, Gayle has played the wrong line."
4,"Nannes to Sarwan, 1 run clipped away for a single"
5,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs a touch too full there as Nannes looked for the yorker, Chanderpaul got to it on the full and clipped from just outside off through midwicket, well placed for a boundary"
6,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, 1 run short and fast, Chanderpaul pulls a single forward of square leg"
7,"Nannes to Sarwan, 1 run turned off his pads for a single to fine leg"
8,"Tait to Sarwan, no run Sarwan can't get this one away"
9,"Tait to Sarwan, 1 leg bye swings in to the legs, it bobs up off the pad and they get through for a leg bye"
10,"Tait to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs lovely stroke from Chanderpaul, he uses Tait's pace and a little width outside off to help the ball on its way with a back-foot drive through point for four"
11,"Tait to Chanderpaul, no run bouncer to reply! Chanderpaul gets out of the way of that one"
12,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 2 runs clipped off the pads through square leg"
13,"Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 run short of a length, Chanderpaul angles the bat and guides this one to third man"
14,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, no run nudged to midwicket, can't beat the field"
15,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, 2 runs fuller, straighter, and Chanderpaul flicks the ball to fine leg"
16,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, no run pushed away to mid-on and they consider a quick single, but Johnson's quick pickup and throw sends them back"
17,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, no run nudged to cover, they can't find a run"
18,"Nannes to Chanderpaul, 1 run yorker length outside off, driven wide of mid off, where Clarke dives across to make the stop"
19,"Nannes to Sarwan, 1 run Sarwan backs off slightly and works it to cover"
20,"Watson to Sarwan, no run clipped away forward of square for a run"
21,"Watson to Sarwan, FOUR runs nicely played, too short from Watson and Sarwan crunches a pull through midwicket"
22,"Watson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan flashes outside off, can't make contact"
23,"Watson to Sarwan, 1 run guided away behind the wicket for a run"
24,"Watson to Chanderpaul, 1 run Chanderpaul walks across his stumps and tries to flick over fine leg, who has come up, but doesn't connect. Watson asks the question for lbw but it's denied by Rudi Koertzen, who called runs"
25,"Watson to Sarwan, no run pushed to mid-on, can't beat the field"
26,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run short and wide of off, worked to point"
27,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 wide bouncer this time, Chanderpaul gets under it and it's called a wide"
28,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs flicked behind square leg, well played by Chanderpaul as he finds the boundary again"
29,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run nudged to point, they think about a quick single but can't get it"
30,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run short of a length, Chanderpaul drives to cover"
31,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs oh, that's wonderful innovation, Johnson bowls a good line outside off and Chanderpaul walks all the way across and flicks it over short fine leg"
32,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, OUT the end of Chanderpaul! He's gone for the aerial drive over the bowler's head, doesn't quite time it and the ball gets a lot of air, David Hussey runs back from mid-on and takes a really well judged catch running with the flight"
33,"Tait to Bravo, no run big appeal from Tait, he's got some nice inswing to Bravo there and wanted the lbw, Koertzen says it's slipping down leg"
34,"Tait to Bravo, no run swinging in again, Bravo pushes to mid on"
35,"Tait to Bravo, no run short of a length now, Bravo hops up on his toes to defend to midwicket"
36,"Tait to Bravo, no run again Bravo is watchful, defending to leg"
37,"Tait to Bravo, 1 run really good yorker, on line and swinging in, but it's well kept out by Bravo, who finds a run to mid on"
38,"Tait to Sarwan, no run almost through him, swinging in towards off stump and Sarwan gets a thick inside edge back onto his pads"
39,"Smith to Bravo, 1 run clipped away off his pads to square leg"
40,"Smith to Sarwan, no run oh, what's happened here? The ball turns past the bat, Sarwan appears to be well in his ground but Haddin whips off the bails and is confident. The third umpire is called for and indeed Sarwan is moving his back foot, well inside the crease, but it's impossible to tell if his foot is just raised or not. His spikes look"
41,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run some turn again from Smith, Sarwan backs away and punches through cover"
42,"Smith to Bravo, 2 runs on the back foot and driven through point, Mike Hussey on the boundary makes a sliding save"

44,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run goes over the top of cover, one bounce to the man in the deep"
45,"Johnson to Sarwan, FOUR runs Sarwan gets this one fine, and fine enough to reach the boundary. Johnson was aiming at leg stump and the batsman got a tickle on it to beat fine leg"
46,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 leg bye pushes a single to the off side"
47,"Johnson to Bravo, 1 run well, quite an expansive pull from Bravo there, he's really got under it and maybe even off the toe of the bat, it's bounced to the man at deep midwicket"
48,"Johnson to Sarwan, no run slower ball outside off, beats the bat"
49,"Johnson to Sarwan, OUT oh, that's extremely unfortunate. What a shocking piece of luck for Dwayne Bravo. Sarwan drives fast and straight - too straight - as the ball clips Johnson's fingers and rockets into the stumps at the non-striker's end with Bravo backing up out of his ground"
50,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run on the pads, Sarwan turns the ball behind square"
51,"Smith to Sarwan, 2 runs a bit too short, it's cut off the back foot through point"
52,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run tossed up and nudged to leg, where there's a big gap, the bowler Smith has to hare off and chase. He ends up at midwicket but is quick enough to keep it to a single"
53,"Smith to Deonarine, no run pushed to the off side"
54,"Smith to Deonarine, OUT Deonarine's inclusion hasn't helped West Indies, he's gone for the glory shot over deep midwicket but straight to the man on the boundary"
55,"Smith to Ramdin, 1 run pulled through midwicket"
56,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run clipped through midwicket again, there's a big gap there with the men back on the boundary"
57,"Johnson to Sarwan, no run driven to extra cover, can't beat the field"
58,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run driven again, this time to long-off"
59,"Johnson to Ramdin, 1 wide wrong line from Johnson this time, down leg and called wide"
60,"Johnson to Ramdin, OUT gone, straightforward dismissal with a ball angled across Ramdin, who looks to dab the ball away and simply gets a thick edge behind"
61,"Johnson to Pollard, no run turned off the pads to backward square"
62,"Johnson to Pollard, no run left alone outside off stump"
63,"Johnson to Pollard, 1 run pushed to cover for a quick single"
64,"Smith to Pollard, no run Pollard leans forward and defends watchfully"

66,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run driven down the ground to long-off"

69,"Smith to Pollard, no run some spin once again, Pollard defends"
70,"Clarke to Sarwan, 1 run pushes a single to the off side"
71,"Clarke to Pollard, 1 run a bit short, driven to long-on off the back foot"
72,"Clarke to Sarwan, 1 run clipped away through leg"
73,"Clarke to Pollard, no run tries to close the face on this one, leading edge heads out to the off side"
74,"Clarke to Pollard, no run defending once again, Pollard is content to be careful for now"
75,"Clarke to Pollard, SIX runs and this time Pollard goes for it, he's got down on one knee to slog sweep, he had no intention of keeping that ball down and lifted it high over midwicket for six"
76,"Hussey to Sarwan, OUT and it goes from bad to worse for West Indies. Sarwan, the last of the specialist batsmen, has tried to clear the boundary at long-off but has simply found the man in the deep"
77,"Hussey to Miller, 2 runs shouts of 'catch it' as it's driven airily between mid off and cover"
78,"Hussey to Miller, 1 leg bye perhaps an edge beats the man at slip"
79,"Hussey to Taylor, OUT two wickets in the over for Dave Hussey, Taylor goes for a big swipe and gets a thickish edge that is taken at gully"
80,"Hussey to Benn, 1 run driven through off, gets through for a single"
81,"Hussey to Miller, no run"
82,"Johnson to Benn, no run Benn flashes outside off, Johnson beats the bat"
83,"Johnson to Benn, no run solid in defence this time"
84,"Johnson to Benn, 1 leg bye shorter from Johnson, Benn gets something on the ball, gets it away through gully"
85,"Johnson to Miller, 1 run dropped. Another drive in the air, Clarke at cover dives to his left and misses the chance with his left hand, not an easy catch but Clarke would take those more often than he'd spill them"
86,"Johnson to Benn, (no ball) 1 run full toss, might have slipped out of the fingers there as it's ballooned up above waist height on the hips, worked to fine leg and called a no-ball"
87,"Johnson to Miller, 1 run turned to leg for another single"
88,"Johnson to Benn, no run thick inside edge could easily have crashed into the stumps, but Benn gets away with it"
89,"Smith to Sarwan, 1 run pulled through leg for a single"
90,"Smith to Pollard, no run turns outside off, Pollard cuts but can't beat the field"
91,"Smith to Pollard, OUT gone! Lovely piece of bowling from Smith, he's turned the ball just past the bat of Pollard, who is trying to get forward and work through leg, and Haddin whips the bails off, no need for the third umpire there"
92,"Smith to Sammy, OUT first ball! Smith is on a hat-trick! Tossed up on leg and turning back to off, Sammy has gone for the drive but straight back to the bowler, who takes a good catch"
93,"Smith to Taylor, no run Taylor goes back and defends outside off"
94,"Smith to Taylor, 2 runs Taylor backs off and cuts this one uppishly forward of point"
95,"Clarke to Sarwan, 1 run pulled fine behind square"
96,"Clarke to Taylor, no run angled in to Taylor, who can't connect and it strikes his pad"
97,"Clarke to Taylor, 1 run tries for the big one through leg, just gets it away edgily"
98,"Clarke to Sarwan, 1 run punched through midwicket"
99,"Clarke to Taylor, no run on the back foot and tries to cut, can't beat the field"

105,"Nannes to Benn, no run nudged to mid-on, can't beat the field"
106,"Nannes to Benn, no run fast and straight, an inside edge onto pad"
107,"Tait to Miller, 1 wide fast and wide down leg"
108,"Tait to Miller, 1 run swing tails in to Miller, who drives to deep cover"
109,"Tait to Benn, 1 run short down leg, Benn swivels for an ungainly pull that gets him a single to fine leg"
110,"Tait to Miller, 1 run more runs behind the wicket, a thick edge to third man"
111,"Tait to Benn, no run full and wide of off, through to the keeper"
112,"Tait to Benn, no run Tait and Haddin ask the question for caught behind, Benn jammed the ball down on a yorker and perhaps the noise of the bat on the ground got the Australians interested"
113,"Tait to Benn, no run similar ball, full and swinging away from the left-hander, who can't get bat on it"
114,"Watson to Miller, no run on the back foot, punched away to point"
115,"Watson to Miller, 1 run pushed to point and they get through for a quick single"
116,"Watson to Benn, no run beats the bat outside off"
117,"Watson to Benn, SIX runs big Benn goes for the big shot! He gets hold of this pull and it's cleared the boundary!"
118,"Watson to Benn, no run beats the bat once again"
119,"Watson to Benn, OUT gone, and that's the end of the innings. Watson goes full and straight and Benn can't get bat on that, it rattles his stumps"
120,"So, West Indies have failed to bat out their overs and have crawled to 105. They need a miracle, now, to get through to the semi-finals. Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson bowled really well, and of course Dirk Nannes got the all-important wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Australia will chase 106 - join us shortly for their reply."
121,Australia are about to start their chase - they cannot be knocked out now. West Indies need to keep Australia to 81 to progress. Here's Jerome Taylor
122,"Taylor to Warner, 1 run on the pads, Warner clips it away through leg"

131,"Benn to Watson, 1 run angled in to leg, Watson drives to long-on"
132,"Benn to Warner, FOUR runs well played by Warner, who punches off the back foot through the gap at cover and away to the boundary, nice placement"
133,"Benn to Warner, no run quicker and flatter, Warner can't beat cover"
134,"Taylor to Watson, 1 run Watson guides this off the face of the bat and away to third man"
135,"Taylor to Warner, FOUR runs another boundary as Warner flashes outside off, one hand off the bat, and the ball sails over point"
136,"Taylor to Warner, FOUR runs wide of off, Warner has room to free himself and slash through the gap forward of point"
137,"Taylor to Warner, 1 wide width again outside off, and too much on this occasion, it's called wide"
138,"Taylor to Warner, no run straighter line from Taylor, and Warner on the back foot pushes to mid-off"
139,"Taylor to Warner, SIX runs that is a massive six! Really big one from Warner, who gets a half-volley and simply launches a baseball-style slog straight back over the bowler's head and it lands on the roof of the pavilion"
140,"Benn to Haddin, no run Haddin is forward to defend"
141,"Benn to Haddin, no run Haddin defends again"

149,"Miller to Clarke, 1 run this time they do take a very quick single, just nudging to leg"
150,"Miller to Haddin, no run Haddin looks to glance behind square but fine leg is up and he can't get off the mark"
151,"Benn to Clarke, no run tossed up and some turn for Benn, Clarke gets it away edgily"

157,"Miller to Clarke, no run drifting in to Clarke, who defends"
158,"Miller to Clarke, 1 run turned away through square leg for an easy single"

161,"Miller to Clarke, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, Clarke drives to long-on"

180,"Miller to Haddin, 1 run worked away to leg once more"
181,"Deonarine to Haddin, FOUR runs not middled at all by Haddin, but he gets enough on it to find the boundary. It was on off stump, he looked for the drive over mid-off and the gap allowed it to trickle in to the boundary"

183,"Deonarine to Haddin, no run defended back to the bowler"

194,"Sammy to Haddin, 1 run pulled to midwicket and they get a very sharp single"
195,"Sammy to Clarke, 1 run taken from well outside off by Clarke, who slaps the ball along the ground to long-on"
196,"Sammy to Haddin, OUT oh, wonderful piece of fielding from Bravo! Haddin guided it off the face to short third man where Bravo dived to his right to make the stop, then fired the ball into the stumps to have Clarke short trying for the single. Great save and super throw, and perhaps a little bit of lazy running from Clarke, who didn't seem to"
197,"Sammy to Hussey, no run driven to cover, can't beat the infield"
198,"Sammy to Hussey, 1 run Hussey is on the back foot and drives through cover"

210,"Benn to Haddin, 1 run Haddin backs away and on the back foot, cuts through cover for a single to the man on the boundary"
211,"Taylor to Haddin, 1 run fullish ball on off stump, it's driven to long-on"
212,"Taylor to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a brave and powerful shot, Taylor swings it in towards off stump and Hussey backs off and lifts the ball over extra cover, once bounce over the boundary. Had he missed that, he would certainly have been bowled"
213,"Taylor to Hussey, 1 run driven down the ground for a single"
214,"Taylor to Haddin, no run cut to point, can't beat the field"
215,"Taylor to Haddin, 1 run driven down the ground for another single to long-on"
216,"Taylor to Hussey, 5 wide well, how that has reached the boundary is a mystery. It was a shortish ball that Hussey back away from, and somehow it's dipped on Ramdin and bounced under his gloves and away to the boundary"

218,"Gayle to Haddin, no run punched back to the bowler"

221,"Man of the Match is Steven Smith for his 3 for 20, he used the St Lucia pitch to his advantage, found some turn and was prepared to toss the ball up."
222,"So that's the end of the Super Eights and it's the end of West Indies' tournament. Australia have won by six wickets and have finished on the top of Group F. They will meet Pakistan in one semi-final and Sri Lanka will meet England in the other. The win was really set up in the very first over of the game, when Dirk Nannes bowled Chris Gayle, who r"
