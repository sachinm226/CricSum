74,"Jadeja to Finch, no run huge lbw shout, given not out, but Dhoni has gone against his instinct to review this. Finch is sweeping, is beaten, and the umpire reckons he is outside the line of off.

75,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run defended to leg for a single"
76,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run driven down to long-on for one"
77,"Ashwin to Smith, 3 runs lovely shot. Ashwin bowls a wide full ball, an offbreak designed to draw his bat away from the body, but he uses the wrists well to keep this drive down. Against the spin it goes, past the cover"

93,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run driven to long-on for one"

134,"Shami to Smith, no run short of a length, wide, beats the punch"
135,"Shami to Smith, SIX runs length ball, angling in, he clears the front leg, and slogs this over midwicket for a six. Smith is slowly hitting that next gear"
136,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs and there is the hundred. Poor bowling. Short ball, waist high. Bouncers get wickets. Just short balls don't. He drags this pull from outside off, beats short fine leg. Removes the helmet. Celebrates the hundreds. Keeps in with the tradition of Aussie Nos 3 standing up tall in big matches"
137,"Sharma to Finch, SIX runs India continue bowling short with no meanness or intent behind the balls. Finch makes room, upper-cuts it, and sends it over point for six. This could just be the turning point in this Finch innings"

139,"Sharma to Smith, no run makes room but drives this full toss straight to extra cover. Misses out"
140,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs slower ball. Matters nowt. He has picked this early, opens the hip by clearing the front leg, and lofts this back over the bowler's head. The move-on is on. Too early to call a Smith double hundred?"
141,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run short of a length, into the body, worked away for a single"
142,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs low full toss, Finch gets inside its line, and provides it a ramp with his bat to launch it over short fine leg for four"
143,"Yadav to Smith, OUT India get the breakthrough. Smith won't score a double. Yadav bowls a bouncer that finally gets head high. Smith clears the front leg to hook. Doesn't control it. The top edge settles with deep square leg. Smith raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off"

145,"Yadav to Finch, 1 wide wide down leg again as Yadav looks to tuck him up but misfires"

147,"Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR runs four first ball for Maxwell. Length ball, into the pads, flicked away, square of fine leg. Easy pickings first up"

154,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs short of a length, at the hips, nicely glanced fine of fine leg. Yadav clumsy with the dive there. Ordinary ball, ordinary fielding"
155,"Shami to Finch, 1 run low full toss, drilled back at him, he gets a touch to it, but the deflection to midwicket yields a single"

157,"Shami to Finch, 1 run short again, rib high again, helped away for a single"
158,"Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye big lbw shout as he plays across the line. The way Finch runs he is looking guilty. Kettleborough gets it right again. This is bouncing over. Finch, though, can be run out, but Raina misses from short cover"
159,"Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR runs just a little short of a length, and Maxwell pulls this Ponting-style for four through long leg. Just helped along the way"
160,"Yadav to Maxwell, SIX runs oh more Ponting evoked here. This is an ordinary short ball, and he sets up the base to go back and pull this over midwicket for six"
161,"Yadav to Maxwell, no run yorker outside off, dug out to mid-off"
162,"Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR runs slower ball, but Maxwell picks it and backs away to drill it back over Yadav's head for four. This is pummelled. Absolutely pummelled"

164,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run length ball, offbreak, bunted to leg for one"

166,"Ashwin to Maxwell, OUT Ashwin has bowled well, and he has got the big Maxwell wicket. Good field placings, good courage to bowl slow through the air. The ball turns into the pads, he cannot play it through the off side, and doesn't bother keeping the sweep down. Straight down the lap of deep backward square it goes"

170,"Yadav to Finch, no run short, outside off, short-arm pulled to midwicket"
171,"Yadav to Finch, OUT good sharp short ball. India are clawing back. They could still keep Australia down to a manageable total. Only Yadav has been able to hurry the batsmen with the short ball. Finch is hurried into this again. This is just outside off, chest high, and does him for the pace. The edge is taken, and caught at midwicket. A hard-working"
172,"Yadav to Clarke, 1 run pulled away for one to deep backward square leg"
173,"Yadav to Watson, no run short of a length, just outside off, pushed to cover off the back foot"
174,"Yadav to Watson, 1 wide wide down the leg side. Kettleborough not affected by the appeal for the catch"

183,"Shami to Faulkner, 1 run short of a length, straight, worked to leg for one"
184,"Shami to Watson, 3 runs slower length ball, Watson has picked the field well with no sweeper back on the off side, and he makes room to go over cover. Not the best connection, but clears the infield"
185,"Shami to Faulkner, FOUR runs that's lucky runs for Faulkner. Good bouncer from Shami, gets it shoulder high, Faulkner looks to drag it from outside off, gets a top edge over the keeper's head"
186,"Shami to Faulkner, FOUR runs this short ball is not that great. A bit tired really. This is only chest high, and he has pulled this between deep backward square and long leg"
187,"Shami to Faulkner, 1 bye makes room, Shami follows him up with the endangered species - the yorker. Just the single off the inside edge"
188,"Shami to Watson, no run another yorker, tailing back in, following him, kept out by Watson, but the desired result for India: a dot ball"
189,"Jadeja to Faulkner, SIX runs Faulkner the finisher. Faulkner the party pooper. Slog-sweeps this flat over midwicket for six. Hits the gloves that are left to dry there"
190,"Jadeja to Faulkner, 1 run makes room to expose the cover field as India strengthen the leg-side field. Raina, though, makes a diving save at cover to save three runs"
191,"Jadeja to Watson, no run Watson looks for a slog sweep this time, gets an inside edge into his back pad. Credit Jadeja for pulling the length back"
192,"Jadeja to Watson, no run bowls a round-arm fast ball outside off, hurries Watson up. Another dot"
193,"Jadeja to Watson, no run clever bowling. Sees Watson backing away, and fires in a wide yorker. Well bowled"

195,"Shami to Watson, 1 run square-drive a wide length ball, Jadeja dives to his wrong side at point to save three runs"

208,"Yadav to Faulkner, FOUR runs full, just short of the yorker length, and he has slogged this straight of deep midwicket. Amazing how he keeps missing the fielders"
209,"Yadav to Faulkner, OUT Faulkner goes after that cameo. Yadav bowls full and straight. Fuller than a length ball, just short of a yorker. Faulkner swings across the line to go over the leg side. Misses it altogether as it tails back in. Timbah"
210,"Yadav to Haddin, no run lovely yorker as Haddin makes room. Right on the crease. Dug out by Haddin, but that is a perfect delivery"
211,"Yadav to Haddin, no run short of a length, quick, no room, 143ks still, Haddin is making room but is cramped"
212,"Yadav to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin is usually stylish down the ground, but this is just power. No elegance, just effectiveness. Makes room to drill this full ball straight of mid-on"

214,"Sharma to Watson, 2 runs slower ball, has him there, Watson has to check that slog, but the top edge somehow clears square leg. Lucky for Watson"
215,"Sharma to Watson, FOUR runs short ball, but not the Yadav variety. Easy to pull this as there is hardly any nasty pace behind this. Pulls this wide of deep midwicket. Now he reaches a run a ball"

217,"Sharma to Watson, OUT slower ball, in his slot, this time he has picked the slower ball, but he has cramped him for room, and his slog settles with deep square leg. Just can't get enough power behind this shot because there is no rook available"
218,"Sharma to Haddin, 1 run slower ball, Haddin reads it late, but opens the face to get a single to short third man"
219,"Sharma to Clarke, OUT another wicket for India. This is a soft dismissal. A little luck for them. This is a short ball. Not a bouncer. No menace behind this. Only waist high. Clarke can see a four over midwicket, but just doesn't get the elevation he desires. Finds Rohit Sharma there. This is what a break in momentum does to you. Slight uncertainty,"
220,"Sharma to Faulkner, no run short of a length, on off, punched to extra cover"

230,"Ashwin to Watson, SIX runs and there is the Watson slog sweep. This can get his innings going. Finally Ashwin goes flatter. Possibly to protect a good over. Watson likes it that he has pitched it within his reach. Sends it sailing over midwicket"
231,"Shami to Haddin, no run this is in the slot. Half-volley outside off. Haddin has mis-hit this. Another dot. Straight to mid-off"
232,"Shami to Haddin, 1 run that mid-off nearly takes a catch. Haddin mis-hits a full ball again, but it bounces just short of mid-off. The single takes them to the first-ever 300 in a World Cup semi-final. Will we see another later this evening?"
233,"Shami to Johnson, FOUR runs but he is not bowling to his field. The field is there for the short ball, but he bowls length, and Johnson carts him over wide mid-on for four first ball"
234,"Shami to Johnson, FOUR runs he bowls short, according to his field, but Johnson has made room to pay an exceptional shot. He has punched this over wide mid-off. Yadav chases well, but inn the end the slide is clumsy, and Johnson gets four"
235,"Shami to Johnson, FOUR runs now that the third man comes in and mid-off goes back, Shami bowls the shortest ball of the over, and Johnson's top edge clears short third man"

239,"Sharma to Haddin, 1 run another slower ball, hit towards deep midwicket, Kohli charges in, gets both hands to it, but drops it. Warner seen clapping that from the balcony"
240,"Sharma to Johnson, FOUR runs full toss with mid-off up not the best ball to bowl. Has missed the yorker in all likelihood. Drilled over mid-off for four"
241,"Sharma to Johnson, SIX runs this was telegraphed. Johnson was expecting the slower ball, and he has drilled it flat, and between long-on and deep midwicket. Flat six to cow corner"
242,"Sharma to Johnson, 1 run short of a length, at the body, no room, they get just a single"
243,"Around Smith, today, Finch battled hard, and once a collapse set in around the 35th over, Watson, Faulkner and Johnson played important little hands to help them over 300. This is the first time this World Cup that India haven't bowled out an opposition. They will need to carry all the confidence and the momentum from having held Australia back if they are"
244,"Ever since India set foot in Australia in November, Smith has scored 921 international runs against them in 10 innings. His lowest against them has been 14 while going for quick second-innings runs on a slow, unyielding pitch in Melbourne"
245,"6.14pm India have done really well in the end to drag Australia back from the time they looked like getting anything upwards of 350-360. A sobering thought about the new fielding restrictions and the modern bats: despite an overall excellent display in the end, India still conceded 89 in the last 10"
246,"G'day, folks. Looks like Australia have done what they do. Are we going to need a collective ECG at the SCG? Do India have a Grant Elliott? Can Mitchell Starc make these questions academic inside the Powerplay? We'll find out shortly. For India fans, here's a flashback to 2012 and the scintillating, successful chase against Sri Lanka in Hobart - only 321 b"

249,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run good carry for Mitch 2.0, climbing off a length in the channel, Rohit draws his bat inside the line"
250,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run probing away around off stump, fast and bouncy from Starc, defended sharply off the back foot"
251,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run full now, driven without foot movement - and taken. Or is it? There's a question of whether this carried, Watson did not seem all that sure at slip. Big edge from Sharma, only just after the ball had pitched, which confused things a touch... Erasmus is checking various replays, looks like there's some grass involved. For"
252,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs pitched up again, in the slot and this time Rohit spears it through point, in the air for a moment but beat the fielder"

257,"Hazlewood to Rohit Sharma, no run goodish length, angled in and blocked over the top of off stump"
258,"Hazlewood to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs fluffs the pull but this flies beyond Haddin scampering away to his left... Got hurried by the short ball and gloved wide of the wicketkeeper, just enough on it and they pick up two"

264,"Starc to S Dhawan, no run Starc is revving at 150kph, steaming in and wanging the ball down around off, blocked back to the bowler, who picks up and attempts to look menacing... But Starc is a big ole puppy dog, we all know that"
265,"Starc to S Dhawan, no run strays on to the pads, flicked firmly but straight to Maxwell at square leg"

269,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run edged and dropped by the diving Brad Haddin! Dhawan had skipped down the track, playing on the up and a big edge flew between keeper and slip, Haddin made the choice to fly after it, got both hands to the ball but was unable to cling on"

273,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length outside off, no stroke"
274,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, 3 runs shortish and whipped away through midwicket, big roars go up around the ground as they scamper three"
275,"Starc to S Dhawan, no run very short and climbing high over the batsman, might have been lucky to get away with that one"
276,"Starc to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye now goes for the yorker, veers in dangerously late and tonks Dhawan on the boot, Dharmasena shakes his head at the lbw appeal... and then an attempt at a run out from point gifts India an overthrow. Australia think about the review but pass"

442,"Watson to Rahane, no run pitched up around off stump, tries to drive but can't get it past mid-on, struggling for timing here"
443,"Watson to Rahane, 1 run shorter and Rahane swipes across the line, it's in the air but bounces a fair way short of deep midwicket"

447,"Johnson to Rahane, 1 wide sprayed across the right-hander from over the wicket, shapes to play but doesn't pull the trigger - wide"

471,"Starc to Rahane, OUT Rahane plays with fire, fiddling at a length ball off the back foot... it slides past the outside edge. No one reacts but Australia then decide to review, not sure on whose prompting. Looks like a gamble, but... While there's no visible deviation, a thin scrape on Snicko is enough for Erasmus, he tells Dharmasena to overturn his"
472,"Starc to Jadeja, no run full and homing in on the stumps, maybe sliding too far to leg as it thumps the pad and Dharmasena turns down Starc's appeal. Finch, fielding at short leg, then hits the stumps for good measure but Jadu was home"

482,"Starc to Dhoni, 2 leg byes length, slightly leg side, flicks the pad and runs fine, Dhoni sets off with two in his mind and Watson's lethargic pick up makes sure he will get them"
483,"Starc to Dhoni, 1 run stays back, rides the bounce of a back-of-a-length delivery, drops one into the covers"
484,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 leg bye zinging back in off a length and Jadeja is beaten on the inside again, thumps the thigh pad and squirts away"

495,"Hazlewood to Jadeja, 1 run straighter line, stays back and works the ball into the leg side"
496,"Hazlewood to Dhoni, 2 runs pulled but it flies high, towards the edge of the ring, but Clarke drops it on the run! A life for Dhoni and how crucial could that be? Big top edge as Hazlewood cramped him for room, Clarke made the ground really well, got his hands under it but allowed it to pop out"
497,"Hazlewood to Dhoni, 1 run short again, Dhoni had retained the strike, pulls this flat down towards fine leg"

505,"Watson to Dhoni, SIX runs full length outside off and this goes, in to the crowd at deep cover! A brutal smear from Dhoni, skipped forwards and cracked it way back over the rope. That's his fifty - the T20 Blood God awakens"
506,"Watson to Dhoni, SIX runs six more, down the ground! Watson delivers it in the slot again and Dhoni pounces, huge forearms pumping as he levers another mighty over long-off"

520,"Starc to Dhoni, OUT gone, Dhoni is run out by a direct hit from Maxwell, that's all, folks! Dhoni heads straight off, head bowed, nothing even India's supernatural finisher could do about this. He'd worked the singles hard, flicked this off his legs to midwicket and let probability have a go - Maxwell only had one stump to aim at but he dead-eyed it"
