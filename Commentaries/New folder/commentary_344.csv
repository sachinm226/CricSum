60,11.10am 238 is what England have managed here without scoring a run today. Australia will be happy with that after Anderson and Bresnan teased them with their 24-run partnership yesterday. Australia's openers should be walking out in a few minutes. Any guesses on who they will be?

95,"Broad to Harris, OUT full length, batsman caught on the crease, it looked straight, did he nick this, not out given, England review. Harris got across his stumps, it looks very straight, any edge? Nope, Harris is already walking off. I think there were too pads which might have de"
