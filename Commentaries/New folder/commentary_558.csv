7,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs that's a lovely cut shot, Watson has placed that one nicely just forward of gully and it races away"
8,"Broad to Watson, 1 run that is a cracking pull for a single, Watson looked to positively murder that ball, but Bopara at deep midwicket makes an outstanding diving save to keep it to one"
9,"Broad to Ponting, no run ah, there's an inside edge from Ponting, who hasn't quite got his eye in yet"
10,"Broad to Ponting, no run left alone outside off"
11,"Broad to Ponting, no run howzat? Not out, says Koertzen. There was some definite inswing there and Ponting is struck outside the line"

13,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run cut straight down into the turf, they get through for a single"

34,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run Flintoff really bending his back here, that bounces a lot and Ponting lets it go"
35,"Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs well placed by Ponting here, Flintoff tries for the yorker but it's a fraction too full and he drives it wide of mid-on"
36,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs shouts of 'catch' here as Watson cuts hard, it wasn't very wide of gully at all there, but would have required something magical from Swann to reach it all the same"
37,"Anderson to Watson, no run guided down into the ground this time to gully"
38,"Anderson to Watson, no run again Watson angles the bat and guides it to gully"
39,"Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson continues to probe outside off, Watson bunts it to cover"

56,"Flintoff to Watson, 1 run dropped out to the off side for a quick single"
57,"Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs edged, or steered, past gully - played all along the ground. Sheesh, runs really have flown today"
58,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run ooh and that could've flown into gully's hands - again Ponting lunged forward massively, as he does, but it's always dangerous against someone of Flintoff's height. Fell short of gully"
59,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run and Ponting isn't made to play, left alone outside off, and that's stumps on the first day"
60,"Onions to Watson, OUT got him first ball! Cut back sharply on Watson who was a little late on this good, quick and straight delivery and that's out!"
61,"Onions to Hussey, OUT he's bowled him! He's bowled him! Hussey has left a straight one and his off stump is pegged back! What a disastrous start for Australia"
62,"Onions to Clarke, no run that wasn't far away at all! A quick bouncer, misdirected down the leg side, and Clarke wasn't far away from gloving that"
63,"Onions to Clarke, no run ooh, a ripper! That's a brute, cutting back and bouncing - significant bounce for Onions in this over. And it's moving around off the seam"
64,"Onions to Clarke, no run nicely played out on the front foot to point, but that's a very good line and length"
65,"Onions to Clarke, 1 run and that's flicked to leg but he was late on it"
66,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run a touch too wide of the off stump and left alone"
67,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run good length but again wide enough for Clarke to leave alone"
68,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run a stray down the leg side"
69,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run left alone outside off. No movement for Flintoff who, at the moment at least, looks a bit stiff"
70,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run comfortably left alone"
71,"Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs inside edge down the leg side. Clarke, understandably nervous about getting forward to Flintoff, especially nervous given the two shock wickets that have brought him to the crease, flicked it very late and past"
72,"Onions to Ponting, 1 run excellent line on middle stump and Ponting walks across his stumps and flicks to mid-on. Onions throws his hands up in the air in anguish, but that's such a Ponting shot"
73,"Onions to Clarke, 1 run another very good line on off stump, just straightening a touch, but well played by Clarke and well run, a single to cover"
74,"Onions to Ponting, FOUR runs outside edge for four! Ponting came lunging forward, as he has done all his career, though he did open the face"
75,"Onions to Ponting, no run very straight, Ponting tries to work it to leg but is rapped high on the thigh, or possibly the midriff"
76,"Onions to Ponting, 1 run solid, confident, aggressive drive to Broad at mid-off"
77,"Onions to Clarke, no run wide and left alone outside off"
78,"Flintoff to Ponting, 3 runs Ponting flicks past short-leg and only by a whisker. An absolute whisker! But Ponting becomes Australia's leading run-scorer in Test matches and he acknowledges the warm applause from a grateful and knowledgeable"
79,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run bouncer. He ducks. The crowd roar."
80,"Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs he reached for that, Clarke, but his off-side play this summer has been quite majestic. Four to him, and though he played it a long way from his body, such was the timing that it shot to the extra-cover boundary"
81,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run short delivery, Clarke hops back and defends"
82,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run fuller delivery that's left alone"
83,"Flintoff to Clarke, 2 runs elegant flick off his pads"
84,"Onions to Ponting, 2 runs hurries Ponting onto a pull who plays it with one hand off the bat. A mis-pull, if you like, and fortunately it lands safely at midwicket"
85,"Onions to Ponting, no run ideal line and length. Ponting's forward, offering an ideal defensive too"
86,"Onions to Ponting, no run nice and full and stroked out to cover"
87,"Onions to Ponting, 3 runs walks across his stumps to work this through midwicket. Ponting lively today, keen to keep the board ticking. And so it is"
88,"Onions to Clarke, no run on middle-and-off, Clarke - slightly squared up, both feet pointing down the pitch - defends"
89,"Onions to Clarke, no run fast leg-cutter with nice carry to Prior. Shoulders arms"
90,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run much too wide. Flintoff's radar is on the blink"
91,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run that's better, shaping in on Ponting's off stump and he defends solidly, though it almost took the splice of his bat...as it often does with Flintoff given his height"
92,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run on the back foot, this time, Ponting's giving a lesson in orthodoxy of defence. Which, in isolation, is fascinating to watch"

94,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run very good line and defended to Bell at point. Very solidly defended, too"
95,"Flintoff to Ponting, 2 runs cuts back late on Ponting who turns his wrists elegantly, and very late, to steal two to fine leg"

97,"Onions to Clarke, no run another leg-cutter but it's too wide"
98,"Onions to Clarke, no run wide and left alone. Leg-cutter. Or leg-cudder, as Richie would say"
99,"Onions to Clarke, no run well bowled again, Onions just finding one to straighten on Clarke. Almost a fast legbreak, that, and very nearly squares Clarke up fatally"

101,"Onions to Clarke, no run on the off stump and defended"
102,"Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs Flintoff altered his delivery, sending it down with a double-whirl of the arm, but Ponting's played that beautifully through midwicket for four. Too straight"

110,"Onions to Ponting, no run bouncer down the leg side"
111,"Onions to Ponting, OUT got him! He's out! A quick bouncer, Ponting went for a hook and got a thin edge through to Prior. Onions has bowled so, so well this morning"
112,"Onions to North, 1 bye cuts back on North a touch - significant movement after it passed North, and that beats Prior too"
113,"Onions to Clarke, no run ooh very well bowled on the off stump. Clarke defends, well back in his crease"
114,"Onions to Clarke, no run fantastic delivery! Clarke's lucky to still be alive there. Outswinger, one of the few deliveries this morning that has swung prodigiously, and that beats Clarke's fishy waft"

122,"Onions to Clarke, no run swings away from the right-hander"
123,"Onions to Clarke, no run short of a length and outside off, Clarke punches it to cover. High front elbow, and as orthodox as you could wish to see"
124,"Onions to Clarke, no run cuts back sharply and England let out a noise that could probably be heard in London. London in Canada. Beautiful off-cutter which cut back sharp and that is so, so close! Looked to me like it was taking out middle-a"
125,"Onions to Clarke, no run just outside off, Clarke doesn't know whether to leave it or play at it"
126,"Onions to Clarke, no run swings back very, very late indeed on the right-hander. This is excellent control, as much as anything, from Onions"
127,"Anderson to North, no run well wide - too wide"

138,"Onions to Clarke, no run hmm, some curvy inswing there, but it still ended up outside off and Clarke could leave it"

146,"Onions to North, no run another punchy drive, this time straight to cover"
147,"Onions to North, no run oops, well bowled but not well played, swinging back in and North seems to leave it to crash into his thigh, half thinking about playing a shot at the same time"
148,"Onions to North, no run driven back down the pitch"
149,"Onions to North, no run outside off and prodded back down the pitch - or should that be the wicket, as Steve Rouse described the 'pitch' as jelly-like the other day, and says he was referring to the outfield as opposed to the playing strip"

158,"Onions to Clarke, no run good length, seams back in to Clarke, who defends"
159,"Onions to Clarke, no run dropped! Oh dear, that's bad cricket from batsman and fielder. A good outswinger from Onions, Clarke shapes to leave but is too slow and the ball runs off the face of the bat straight to second slip, where Flintoff g"
160,"Onions to Clarke, no run down leg side now, Clarke doesn't get anything on it"
161,"Onions to Clarke, 3 runs nice pull there from Clarke, he just turned this one from off stump through midwicket and it was well reeled in by Bell on the boundary"

214,"Anderson to Hauritz, no run bouncer, and a tame one, sailing way over his head"

222,"Broad to Hauritz, no run defended on the back foot"

224,"Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run booming inswinger but too straight. Flicked nicely behind square"

243,"Broad to Hauritz, no run defended on the back foot"
244,"Broad to Hauritz, no run an outswinging half-volley crunched to mid-off. Hauritz is more than useful with the bat. Solid defensive technique and looks quite orthodox when driving"
245,"Broad to Hauritz, no run short of a length and defended out to the off side"

267,"Onions to Hilfenhaus, 1 run short of a length, he mis-hooks it out to extra cover and Bopara's giving chase and ought to take it comfortably. But drops it! What a clanger. Bopara's having a rubbish series, to be honest"

502,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run this one holds its line, and Prior defends it powerfully out to the off side"
503,"Siddle to Flintoff, 1 leg bye a leg-bye is taken. Flintoff limps through - could have had two, but he's nowhere near fit enough"

508,"Watson to Flintoff, no run driven back to the bowler firmly"
509,"Watson to Flintoff, FOUR runs bang! The first really authoritative shot from Flintoff, absolutely murdering it down the ground. Nothing more than a prod, but it nearly killed Prior"
510,"Watson to Flintoff, no run wide of the off stump"
511,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run lovely cover drive but stopped by backward point"
512,"Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run that's well run. Prodded to cover and he took off...a little slowly. Not quite limping but..."

516,"Siddle to Prior, no run very solid on-drive, but mid-on does well"
517,"Watson to Flintoff, FOUR runs bash! Nothing more than a defensive push, straight back through Watson's legs and it scorches for four! Flintoff doesn't move"
518,"Watson to Flintoff, 1 run a clip off his legs for a single"
519,"Watson to Prior, 2 runs short, and pulled - mispulled, the ball skying high but safe into the midwicket region and dropping dead on the soggy outfield"

521,"Watson to Flintoff, no run well wide and cutting still further wide"

523,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run short ball, lofts a hook away over midwicket"
524,"Siddle to Flintoff, 2 runs some tailing inswing there, Flintoff clips it nicely off his pads and they run sharply to get two to the man on the boundary"
525,"Siddle to Flintoff, FOUR runs power. Cracking power. Flintoff hammers this drive through cover point and there's not much doubt about that one reaching the boundary"

527,"Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run clipped away off the pads to deep square leg"

533,"Watson to Prior, no run better length this time, left alone outside off"
534,"Watson to Prior, no run straight-bat defence this time"
535,"Siddle to Flintoff, no run ouch. Bangs in a bouncer and Flintoff ducks but appears to lose sight of it, the ball thuds into his left bicep"

537,"Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run cramps Flintoff up again, he gets it away to square leg but edgily and he didn't know where it had gone"
538,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs Prior won't back down from this bouncer though, he's gone for the hook and a top edge flies down to fine leg for a boundary"
539,"Siddle to Prior, no run good length now, a bit of shape in to Prior this time and he lets it go"
540,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs that is a tremendous shot. Prior pounces on one that's just short of a length and drives it wonderfully off the back foot through cover point, that positively sped off the bat"
541,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run good line straight off, Flintoff lunges forward to defend"
542,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 3 runs a bit too short and Flintoff punches it through cover, the ball is chased down just inside the boundary"

545,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run tossed up and Flintoff defends"
546,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run outside off, only the tiniest amount of turn, Flintoff shuffles across and then leaves"
547,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs lovely on-drive, inswinger and angled to the pads, Prior pounces and times that one terrifically"
548,"Siddle to Prior, no run doesn't time this one though, it's shorter, Prior tries to pull and gets a thickish under-edge"
549,"Siddle to Prior, OUT oops, mistimes this one and that's the end of Prior. Short ball, pulled and comes off the bottom of the bat, lobbing up to mid-on where the 12th man Phil Hughes takes the catch"
550,"Siddle to Broad, no run good length, Broad defends back down the pitch"
551,"Siddle to Broad, no run squares him up this time, it flies off a thickish edge to gully, along the ground"

555,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run defended away safely"
556,"Hauritz to Flintoff, FOUR runs another good shot, Flintoff sweeps from outside off and it runs away through square leg for a boundary"
557,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run shuffles across and takes one on the pad, a long way outside off"

567,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run drifts onto off stump now, Flintoff defends"
568,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run flatter and fuller outside off, he tries to cut but it beats the bat"

574,"Siddle to Broad, 2 runs goes for the yorker here but Broad squeezes it through midwicket and gets off the mark"
575,"Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs well played, Siddle pushes this one across and tempts the drive, Broad obliges but it's a very well timed and placed shot through extra cover"
576,"Siddle to Broad, 2 runs oh is that a drop? No, it's just fallen short of Manou. Angled across Broad and a thick edge dips on the keeper, lands a few centimetres in front of his left glove and then runs away to third man"
577,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run prodded away defensively"
578,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run works it to midwicket"

583,"Johnson to Flintoff, no run nice line to start with, Flintoff looks to work through leg and then checks his shot"

594,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 2 runs again it's tossed up outside off, Flintoff cracks it through cover"

602,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run cut away through cover for a single"
603,"Hauritz to Broad, 3 runs well placed, Broad works against the spin but with the drift, and chips it over wide midwicket"
604,"Hauritz to Flintoff, OUT well, well. That's a very odd dismissal, it spins out of the rough and Flintoff plays no shot, but doesn't get his gloves out of the way, and the catch is taken at first slip"
605,"Hauritz to Swann, no run defended back down the pitch"
606,"Hauritz to Swann, no run ouch, driven hard back down the pitch and Hauritz hurls out the right hand and takes a painful blow, very similar to the knock that dislocated his finger earlier in the series"

608,"Johnson to Swann, no run bangs it in and it's pushed to point"

616,"Hauritz to Broad, no run pushed to mid-on"
617,"Hauritz to Broad, 1 run tip and run here, nudged to midwicket and they hare through for a quick single, the throw at the stumps ricochets off the bat and so they don't take any overthrows"
618,"Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs too short, too wide, and that's an appropriately straightforward crunch through cover for a boundary"
619,"Hauritz to Swann, no run prodded away defensively again"
620,"Johnson to Broad, no run fires it in wide down the leg side"
621,"Johnson to Broad, no run another horrid stray down the leg side. I hope Manou didn't have anything too stodgy at tea, because he's being given a bit of a workout right now"
622,"Johnson to Broad, 1 run gets this shorter ball on target and Broad fends it down to fine leg. Nasty delivery"
623,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs short of a length and punched elegantly off the back foot, just like Dominic Cork would've done"

635,"Johnson to Broad, no run good line just outside off, and he defends on the back foot"
636,"Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs heck of a shot. He had to wait for it, slightly slower, but Broad timed it amazingly well through the leg side. Aerial, but perfectly safe"
637,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs sliced off the back foot past gully and no third man - that'll be four. Hauritz gives chase from deep point, slides, and takes out a massive chunk of turf which he begrudgingly has to replace. The crowd give hi"
638,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run nice and full but a lovely clip off his toes"
639,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs flashes and get an edge past the slips for four more! No third man. Oh deary me. Australia are haemorrhaging runs here"
640,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run left alone outside off"
641,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, 2 runs a tuck off his hips in front of square. Hauritz receives a cheer for successfully stopping it this time. Good old drunken banter from a boozed-up Edgbaston"
642,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run beaten with a beauty that lifted and left Broad's swishing blade. Hilfenhaus is seriously unimpressed and gives Bambi a sweaty glare"
643,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs four more! This is ridiculous. Swann throws the bat and it flies down to the vacant third man"
644,"Johnson to Swann, (no ball) wayhay! A no-ball bouncer, Swann sways out of the way"
645,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs four! Short and chopped brilliantly behind point. That's quite a shot from a tailender. Great balance"
646,"Johnson to Anderson, 1 run off the mark first ball! Nudged off his hip"
647,"Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs what a shot. What a stroke from Broad. Johnson's giving him an absolute earful, but this is a serious stroke - off the back-foot, straight down the ground."
648,"Johnson to Broad, 1 run a neat flick off his hip"
649,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, 1 run a squidge through midwicket"
650,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run left alone outside off"

652,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run fuller and he drives and misses"
653,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run attempted yorker but it's a full toss, bashed back to the bowler"
654,"Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs bouncer, Broad attempts to hook it and top-edges it over the keeper for four! Johnson's not going to like that. England's lead approaching the 100 now"
655,"Johnson to Broad, no run steps a touch to leg, tries to drive - and how on earth has that missed his stumps?! He had all three to aim at, and it went over the top of middle-and-off"

664,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run sliced down to third man"
665,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run bouncer, Broad misses out"
666,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs Broad flogs it through midwicket and they might get three. They'll get four, in fact, as the fielder palms it over the rope. Very good shot - timed it much better than anyone thought initially"
667,"Siddle to Onions, no run defended to point"
668,"Siddle to Onions, no run plays and misses outside off"
669,"Siddle to Onions, no run down the leg side. Good take by Manou who has kept very tidily, bar one or two slips. He looks solid behind the timber, though"
670,"Siddle to Onions, no run short, wide - Onions tries to cut and can't time it"
671,"Siddle to Onions, no run cuts and misses once more - great take by Manou, diving forward and snaffling it in the front of his glove"
672,"Siddle to Onions, no run sheesh that was close! Left alone and it nearly cut back into his off peg. Super leave, that"
673,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, 1 run driven out to deep extra cover and this time he does take a single"
674,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run got him! Five for Hilfenhaus - no! Drops just short of slip. Brilliant ball, angling in to Onions who got a thick outside edge"
675,"Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run nice slice from Onions past the gully"
676,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run edged? No. I'm hearing things"
677,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs what a shot. A smashing pull through midwicket, bisecting two in the deep - fantastic way to bring up his fifty, and a very impressive fifty too"
678,"Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs smash. Broad's taken them apart here. A full toss, absolutely hammered back through Hilfenhaus's hands for four down the ground. He has put some hurt on that ball!"
679,"Siddle to Onions, no run defended on the back foot"
680,"Siddle to Onions, 1 run cuts back on Onions, the ball gets stuck in the pad then falls out - Broad calls him through for a single and they get it. Sleepy cricket from Australia, really"
681,"Superb knock by Broad. 55 from 64, a really impressive knock which has given England a fine lead of 113. Two hours or so left in the day's play. You can have a look at our live Hawk-Eye feed of all the important stats and graphs and so on, and we'l"
682,"Incidentally, there are 10,000 tickets available for tomorrow's fifth and final day. ?25 for adults, ?10 for under-16s. An absolute steal. Edgbaston.com is where to go."
