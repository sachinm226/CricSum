7,"Kane Richardson to Mendis, no run dropped by Smith at point! Nearly a screamer! Short and wide, cut hard to backward point, Smith's flying full stretch with one hand to his right, it doesn't hit the middle of the hand and it drops down. That would have been one of the all time great catches"

24,"Stanlake to Gunathilaka, 2 runs backs away and lofts this high over backward point and it lands safely as three fielders converge at wide third man. They sprint well for two. Gunathilaka had to dive in"

48,"Zampa to Perera, 1 run shorter and wider, he is back and cutting firmly to deep point"

58,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run 121kph, shorter slower ball, he cuts, checking the stroke to deep point"
59,"Cummins to Dickwella, FOUR runs scoops over the keeper first ball! Length ball top of off, he set up early and scooped it high over the keeper's head, Stanlake ran around from third man and nearly caught it! It just beat him and went over the rope on the bounce"
60,"Cummins to Dickwella, 1 run 139kph, back of a length on off, he's back and across to knock this square of midwicket"
61,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run 120kph, short slower ball, he pulls making sure he rolls the wrists to get it down. They push for two but it's not on"

66,"Agar to Perera, 2 runs length on leg stump, expertly dabbed into the vacant midwicket region with soft hands"
67,"Agar to Perera, OUT chopped onto his off stump! Perera is crestfallen. It's an arm ball from Agar, short of a length and just outside off. And after two balls of quality batting against spin, he's had a hurried chop at this to try and get runs behind square on the off side. It slides on, there's no room, and that's the end of him"
68,"Agar to Hasaranga de Silva, no run length and a bit of turn away after this dips on an off stump line. Static feet as he drops this into the covers"
69,"Stanlake to Shanaka, no run short of a length just outside off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
70,"Stanlake to Shanaka, OUT big appeal for catch behind and a late signal from the umpire. Shanaka is caught down the leg side and he isn't going to review. A steep short ball starting at a middle stump line and going down leg. He has a swish at it from underneath and can only manage to get the high part of this outside edge on it. Quick feet from Carey before he holds on comfortably"
71,"Stanlake to Udana, no run short and angled in at leg stump. Ducks under this"
72,"Stanlake to Udana, no run length on off stump, watchfully defended from the crease"

79,"Zampa to Hasaranga de Silva, 2 runs nice looking shot, bursts through the hands of extra cover. Length ball on off stump, steps out and pummels this on the rise with the turn. Sweeper is forced to clean up behind Finch"
80,"Zampa to Hasaranga de Silva, 1 run length on middle stump, nudged with the angle to midwicket"

85,"Agar to Hasaranga de Silva, 1 run length on leg stump, poked into the vacant midwicket region"
86,"Agar to Udana, no run full and flat, 103kph, just outside off. Jammed back down the pitch and he dives to his left to stop"
87,"Zampa to Hasaranga de Silva, 1 run length on leg stump, jumps down to the pitch of it and drills it to long-on's left"
88,"Zampa to Udana, 2 runs full on off stump, looks to force a drive through the covers, gets a thick inside edge to trickle into the vacant square leg area"
89,"Zampa to Udana, 1 run length on off stump, looks to drive through the off side again. Gets a thick inside edge again. This time he won't steal a second"
90,"Zampa to Hasaranga de Silva, OUT completely beaten by flight. This is lobbed right up, but a tad wider than all his previous deliveries. Looks like room and that has Hasaranga running at it. But he doesn't make the pitch and this bounces past his bat. Carey with barely any haste. Takes his time, because there's plenty"
91,"Zampa to Sandakan, no run short of a length and turning away just outside off. Pushed down the pitch off the back foot"
92,"Zampa to Sandakan, no run length on off stump, solidly blocked on the front foot"
93,"Cummins to Udana, no run length on off stump, defended into the covers from the crease"
94,"Cummins to Udana, 2 runs mistimed but safely between the backpedaling mid-on and deep midwicket. Short of a length at off stump. Backs away and has a swat at this. It comes off the inside half of the bat"
95,"Cummins to Udana, no run beaten on the hook. Slower short ball gets awkward and he can't connect"
96,"Cummins to Udana, OUT top edge straight out to deep square. Full speed short ball this time, up at his throat. He's on the front foot and has a swat at it with no control. Richardson hangs on low in front"

98,"Cummins to Sandakan, 2 runs sliced over point. Short of a length at off stump, walks into the leg side and heaves at this. Third man cleans up"
99,"Kane Richardson to Malinga, FOUR runs slapped past mid-off! Sri Lanka have 100. Length on off stump, makes room and gives this a tennis forehand to get it to the fielder's left on the bounce"
100,"Kane Richardson to Malinga, FOUR runs launched to the extra cover boundary! Malinga looks an angry man. Length ball on middle stump, makes room and whacks it on the up over extra cover"
101,"Kane Richardson to Malinga, 1 run short outside off, looks for the hook, gets a top edge out to third man"
102,"Kane Richardson to Sandakan, no run just past leg stump. Length ball climbs past the attempted slog"
103,"Kane Richardson to Sandakan, no run slower length ball wide outside off, backs away and check-taps to extra cover"
104,"Kane Richardson to Sandakan, 1 run length on off stump, mistimed drive to mid-off on the rise"
105,"Zampa to Sandakan, 1 run dipping length ball on off stump. Looks to drive through the covers and gets a thick inside edge to deep backward square"
106,"Zampa to Malinga, no run given lbw after stepping out. He reviews it. He didn't get a long way down on this. It's a length ball on off stump and a googly, that raps him in line. But this pitch does have a fair amount of bounce...yes, that is bouncing over leg stump. He survives."
107,"Zampa to Malinga, OUT stumped next ball. Fuller and flatter and wider outside off. A slider, it appears. He steps out and gets too far leg side of it to make contact"
108,"Zampa to Pradeep, no run googly strikes him on the front foot but that is spinning down leg. Looked to defend that on the front foot"
109,"Zampa to Pradeep, 1 run just out of Zampa's reach! Length ball on off stump, looks for the sweep and gets a top edge just in front of where mid-on would have been. Zampa runs backwards and stretches out his right hand and gets to it with a dive, but can't hold on"
110,"Zampa to Sandakan, 1 run yorker length just outside off, jammed to sweeper cover"
111,"Cummins to Sandakan, FOUR runs short of a length and rising up at off stump. Backs away and has a swat at this. Top edge sails over the keeper"
112,"Cummins to Sandakan, 1 wide short ball rising up sharply at a middle stump line. Jumps out of the way to let that go"
113,"Cummins to Sandakan, no run slower short ball just outside off. Under-edge on the cut, into the off side"
114,"Cummins to Sandakan, 1 run slower short ball at off stump, thick inside edge to deep midwicket on the pull"
115,"Cummins to Pradeep, 1 run full on leg stump, backs away and drives to long-on"
116,"Cummins to Sandakan, no run full on off stump, makes room and drives straight to extra cover"
117,"Cummins to Sandakan, OUT sent upstairs for the run out. Slower length ball is slapped back into the non-striker's stumps and they take off for a run. Cummins goes back and rips the stumps out of the ground with the ball in his left hand. And he's caught him short."
118,"7:41pm They don't make it the full 20 overs. It's another disappointing outing for Sri Lanka's batsmen. Malinga decided to bat first, felt it would give them more freedom. In many ways, that freedom has been their downfall. Some ordinary shots, some overambitious ones when rebuilding was required and it was a free for all by the end of it. Two wickets each for four Australian bowlers, and two run-outs"

126,"Pradeep to Warner, 3 runs 130kph, back of a length, he just punches that with ease off the back foot through cover. Hardly a punch. More a gentle push into the gap. Timed it perfectly"

192,"Pradeep to Smith, 1 run slower short ball outside off, slapped out to sweeper cover"
193,"Pradeep to Warner, no run slower ball at a length outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
194,"Sandakan to Smith, 1 run length on middle stump, steps out and flicks to long-on"
195,"Sandakan to Warner, no run another rip-the-stumps run out at the other end. This one has been sent upstairs. Warner smashed it back and Smith was walking down a long way. Sandakan had the ball in one hand and the stump in the other. No contact at all between the two, which is how it's supposed to be done. Smith was way outside and would've been out but Sandakan's erred over there"
196,"Sandakan to Warner, FOUR runs pummeled down the pitch. Short of a length and sitting up nicely for him. He stays on the crease and gets this to fizz past the bowler and then beats long-off's attempt to the left"
197,"Sandakan to Warner, no run length on off stump, tapped to extra cover"
198,"Sandakan to Warner, no run length on off stump, steps out and bat-pads this as he looks to flick"
199,"Sandakan to Warner, 1 run length on off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
200,"Hasaranga de Silva to Warner, 1 wide wide. And that's the game! Easy peasy. A short ball down leg side, he can't get bat on that"
201,"9:05pm Australia go up 2-0, which means they've sealed a series win with seven overs to spare. Nothing really improved for Sri Lanka today. The difference in quality was just as wide as it was in the first game. The decisions from their batsmen didn't improve, the bowling wasn't all that better and there were poor moments on the field as well. For Australia, a minor glitch - Finch caught down leg side"
