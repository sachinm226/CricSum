To be fair to Johnson, he got a good amount of bat on that.. he flicked it off the middle stump and this would have been a six on some grounds.. but this is a long boundary..

284,"Steyn to Faulkner, FOUR runs Whoaa.. Fa U L K N E R!! He goes long..

305,"Morkel to Starc, no run swing and a miss, but Australia have done well"
306,"A 71-run stand between Mitchell Starc and James Faulkner has lifted Australia from the dungeons and have given them a total to fight.

351,"Marsh to du Plessis, no run full ball outside off, defended solidly to the off side"
352,"Marsh to du Plessis, FOUR runs Marsh drops it short, he doesn't have the pace to drop it short, especially against Faf in this form, Faf swats this to the square-leg boundary"
353,"Marsh to du Plessis, 3 runs this time it is fuller, but still Faf gets three as he launches this over the off side, skips down the track and sends it over cover, can't time it properly so the fielder can drag it back as it nears the rope"
