245,"Southee to White, 1 run yorker again, dug out to long on and they can only take the single"
246,"Southee to Clarke, 1 run Clarke moves across to the off side and Southee follows him and Clarke whips it into the leg side to the sweeper"
247,"Southee to White, 2 runs full and clubbed down the ground and Brendon Mc msfields in the deep and they take a tight second"
248,"Southee to White, FOUR runs full and he just misses the yorker, White cracks it straight, just past Southee's head for four, amazing power!"
249,"Southee to White, 1 run yorker length driven to long on and Brendon Mc does well to prevent the second. If it's a tie it will go down to a Super Over! The scenes are electric here."
250,"Southee to Clarke, 2 runs, OUT Clarke moves forward, gets to it on the full and clubs it to long on, Nathan Mc dives to save the boundary and parries it, the batsmen come back for the third but Clarke is well short and we are going to a Super Over! What a match folks. This is sensational stuff!"
251,"Right, buckle up for the Super Over. The team chasing will bat first, so White won't have to take his pads off. Australia's three batsmen are White, Warner and Haddin. If they lose two wickets, that's the end of the Super Over innings."
