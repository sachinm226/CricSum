52,"de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run sliding into the pads again, glanced behind square"

101,"de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched off the backfoot just wide of point who dives to his left to cut it off but they get enough time to complete the single"

106,"Ferguson to Head, FOUR runs short ball, Head lays into a pull shot and the ball races away between long-on and deep midwicket"
107,"Ferguson to Head, no run moves across early to cover his stumps. It's pre-meditated. The ball was wide and outside off. It's slower also and takes forever to get to Head who gets beaten as he attempts an awkward slap"
108,"Ferguson to Head, 1 run goes too hard at it and knocks this length ball outside off to mid-off"
109,"Ferguson to Warner, 3 runs short ball juust around off, pulled away to cow corner. Two fielders - deep midwicket and long-on - give it a chase and converge on the ball.

129,"de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run full and on the off-stump channel, Warner drops it in front of cover for a quick single"
130,"Boult to Warner, FOUR runs lucky boundary, that. It wa sshort and wide outside off. Cross-seam delivery does not bounce as much as he would have liked and Warner gets a bottom edge that beats the diving wicketkeeper and races way to the fine leg boundary"
131,"Boult to Warner, 1 run gets an inside edge again and skews it to square leg this time"
132,"Boult to Head, FOUR runs what a shot! Absolutely bludgeoned. You offer width at the pace outside off, it's going to go to the boundary nine out of 10 times. Head was struglging with his timing and wasn't able to find the middle of the bat. But that muct have felt good. Lays into the cut shot and the ball goes away to the square third man boundary"

139,"de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run close run out chance at the striker's end. It was a short ball and Warner pulls it just wide of short fine leg.

141,"de Grandhomme to Head, no run fuller on middle and leg, flicked away to midwicket"
142,"Ferguson to Warner, 1 run steered down to third man"

144,"Ferguson to Head, 1 run very full and outside off, knocked powerfully down the ground to long-off"
145,"Ferguson to Warner, 1 run short ball, Warner swivels around with the pull to deep midwicket. Momentarily thinks of a second run but it went straight to the fielder there so they decide against it"
146,"Ferguson to Head, 2 runs great running. It was full and outside off. Head drilled it hard to mid-off but did not time it precisely. Williamson fires a throw at the non-striker's end as they scamper across for a quick sinlgle.

147,"Ferguson to Head, no run short of a length ball, Head inside-edges the pull to the pad and Ferguson darts forward on the follow-through to ensure there is no run"

151,"de Grandhomme to Head, 1 run fuller outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
152,"de Grandhomme to Warner, FOUR runs oh, what a shot. That was unorthodox but so effective. It was a length ball outside off and Warner flat-bats it off the backfoot straight down the ground. Nigel Llon ghas to jump out of the way as the ball shoots past him and past the straight boundary"
153,"de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run short ball, pulled to deep square leg"
154,"Santner to Warner, 2 runs pushed across on a length outside off, Warner makes room for himself before punching it through covers, picks the gap perfectly"

162,"Southee to Head, no run goes for a wild slog across the line to this fuller ball and gets comfortably beaten. It was a cross-seam delivery and he was probably done in by the lack of pace on that delivery"
163,"Southee to Head, 1 run fuller ball, driven firmly and rather uppishly towards mid-off. Head sets off for a quick single and the ball lands just in front of Williamson who fires in a throw at the non-striker's end. He misses but a direct hit would have seen the back of him"
164,"Southee to Warner, no run fuller ball outside off, driven to cover"
165,"Southee to Warner, FOUR runs short ball, Warner swivels around and pulls it past the diving fielder at backward square leg"
166,"Santner to Head, 1 run makes room to get close to the line of the ball before tucking it to deep square leg"
167,"Santner to Warner, FOUR runs oh, lovely shot. Gets it very fine and the ball goes away to the fine leg boundary. That's Warner's seventh ODI century. Only Tendulkar (nine in 1998) has more in a calendar year. Coming to the delivery, it was a length ball that didn't spin much. Warner tucks it off the pads and it seems like the ball would go to the short fine leg fielder. But"
168,"Santner to Warner, 1 run tucked to the leg side"
169,"Santner to Head, 1 run fuller ball, driven to long-on and that is the 100 of the partnership"

174,"Southee to Head, no run moves across again to meet this fuller ball that's fired wide outside off, crunches a square drive but the ball is fielded at point where the fielder makes a diving save"
175,"Southee to Head, no run still can't beat point. Short of a length and Head slaps it but Latham this time dives to his left to cut it off"
176,"Southee to Head, 2 runs short ball, pulled away to deep square leg. There is a man at deep backward square leg stationed, and he moves across to gather it before the boundary"
177,"Southee to Head, 1 run moves across to protect off-stump before steering it to third man"
178,"Santner to Head, OUT pre-meditated. Good delivery from Santner. Head moves across perhaps looking for an expansive shot through the off side. But Santner gets it to drift away from around the stumps and Head is far away from the line of the ball as a result. It does not turn much either, so he can't get anywhere close to it and the ball crashes into the stumps"
179,"Santner to Wade, no run floated and pushed across on a length outside off, blocked"
180,"Santner to Wade, no run good length ball on middle stump, Wade tucks it to the leg side"
181,"Santner to Wade, 1 wide ooh, that was a loopy delivery drifting down leg. Not too far away from the leg stump and Wade cannot make contact as he tries to get it behind square. The wicketkeeper takes the bails off after collecting it but his foot was inside the crease. Called a wide"

197,"Munro to Wade, 1 run too full and straight, 112.3ks, whipped through midwicket"
198,"Munro to Warner, SIX runs Warner clears long-on. Just short of a good length on middle, Warner unleashes a front-foot pull, nay a golf-swing over long-on. Boult flies to his right from long-on, but the ball sails over him. Boult flies over and lands beyond the ad boards"
199,"Munro to Warner, SIX runs shortish and outside off, Warner unleashes a rasping pull. Puts Munro over the boundary again, clears a leaping deep midwicket now. #MCG not big enough for Warner. Is Williamson regretting the Munro experiment?"

246,"David Warner, the man of the moment: It was one of those wickets that was two- paced (Your captain said it was one hell of a knock?). The odd one was skidding through. With a couple of wickets down, we had to knuckle down. The miles in the legs; that is what we do. I am ready to go and defend the target. I think 264 is enough."
247,"The hosts were pinned down to 4 for 73, but Warner rode out the tough phase, and shifted gears in the slog overs. In the process, he raised his seventh ODI century of the year. Only Tendulkar has more centuries in a year than Warner."

Nigel Llong raised his finger but Williamson reviews it. Only w"

441,"Faulkner to Southee, 2 runs comes down the track early again and the ball follows him which aids Southee as he lofts it over the on side with the angle. Does not get enough on it though and the ball is fielded at deep midwicket"
442,"Starc to Ferguson, no run fuller ball, angling in on the stumps from outside off, defended"
443,"Starc to Ferguson, no run Smith claims a catch at slips and it's not given. It certainly carried to Smith at second slip who dives forward and takes it. It was a short ball and Southee was trying to drop his wrists and back away. But the ball goes off the back glove, on to the forearm and lobs towards Smith. Australia review it and replays show that the back hand had come o"

450,"Faulkner to Ferguson, 1 run short of a length ball, back-of-the-hand slower variation. Ferguson dabs it uppishly into the vacant region around forward short leg"
451,"Faulkner to Southee, OUT Southee's chancy stay comes to and end with a miscue to extra cover. It was the slower ball and Southee was forward looking for a big hit over long-off. The lack of pace means he does not get the timing right and he skews it off the high end of the bat to Warner who settles under it at extra cover"

465,"Faulkner to Boult, 1 run full and on the pads, Boult backs away and whips it to midwicket"
466,"Cummins to Boult, OUT oh, what a way to finish! It's Smith again. Took a stunner in the previous game. This one's as good if not better than the one in the previous ODI. He dived to his left on that occasion"
467,"Travis Head - Fantastic. Great opportunity, the last three games. We've played fantastically, especially after the last couple of months we've had, it feels great to win. I feel in good touch. Probably did not sum up the conditions as well as I would have liked to. It was a slow wicket. Happy that I was able to help win the game with the ball as well."
468,"Pat Cummins - Absolutely, it was actually a little tougher today. David Warner played an unbelievable innings and it feels great to finish 3-0. Can't wait to get out there and bowl a few deliveries. I think on a wicket like this, it's a bit slow and there is not going to be much boundaries, so we had to stop the singles, which is something we pride ourselves in doing. It seems lik"
469,"So the final assessment reads like this - David Warner - 156; New Zealand - 147. Little else needs to be said. Australia complete a 3-0 sweep, and given how rough the last few months have been, this win must taste especially sweet. David Warner made all the difference between the two sides. On a pitch where the rest of Australia and all of New Zealand's batsmen struggled, Warner w"
470,David Warner is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series.
471,"Warner - It's a team performance. Credit to the bowlers for coming out and executing the plans. Us as batsmen, we had to relay the message and they did extremely well. My first coach of cricket until I was about 16 or 17 passed away, my condolences to his family. I would like to hope my form is getting better, but I need to keep hitting the nets and work harder."
472,"Kane Williamson - There has been a player in the Aussie side who has contributed in every game. Pretty disappointing. We did want to show signs of improvement, which is why today's performance was especially disappointing. We would have had to bat well to chase down 264, but it was pretty gettable. I don't think we were smart enough with the bat today. Australia thoroughly deserve"
473,Steven Smith - The catch wasn't a bad one. It was a nice way to finish. We have put up a pretty complete performance in all three games. We needed to improve after South Africa. The bowlers put in good performances. The guys from the top four going and getting hundreds and bowers sticking to plans has helped us turn it around. All three quicks bowled beautifully throughout the ser
474,"That's it from us for this game then. Australia have been clinical with bat and ball throughout the series and deservedly end with a 3-0 scoreline that is a fairly accurate representation of the teams' performances. Meanwhile, India are going strong in their reply to England's 400 in the fourth Test in Mumbai. Just about half an hour left in the day, so stay tuned. Until next time"
