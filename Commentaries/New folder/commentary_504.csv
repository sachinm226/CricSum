0,"12.35pm England have won the toss and will field. England go in with an unchanged team and adopt and unchanged gameplan. Australia too are unchanged and Ponting, flinty-eyed as ever, understandably wants to see more from his batsmen."
1,"Anderson to Watson, no run tidy start from Anderson, zipping an outswinger past off stump and Watson leaves it alone"
2,"Anderson to Watson, no run ooh, bit loose from Watson, Anderson got this to jag away off the seam and Watson fenced at it, no harm done though and Kieswetter collects"
3,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run Australia are off, in gentle fashion, another outswinger finds the outer half of the bat and runs away for a single backwards of point"
4,"Anderson to Paine, 1 wide Anderson searches for an inswinger and duly fires it down leg for a wide"
5,"Anderson to Paine, no run better here, adjusting to outside off stump, Paine, who has a face far more gentle than his name, leaves well alone"
6,"Anderson to Paine, no run swing again, nice to see some movement in the air, Paine looks carefully and leaves it alone"
7,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run Paine is off and running, nudging the ball to mid on and scampering through for a single. Decent first over for both sides you'd think"

10,"Bresnan to Paine, no run good cricket here, full, touch of movement and Paine defends tidily"
11,"Bresnan to Paine, 2 runs another ball fractionally overpitched, Paine pushed a drive down the ground via an inside edge, and collects a couple"

13,"Bresnan to Paine, no run tidy finish to the over, fuller, some away movement and Paine lets it go by"
14,"Anderson to Watson, no run tidy stuff here again from Anderson, outside off and Watson leaves alone"
15,"Anderson to Watson, no run fuller this time, Watson leans into a solid defensive block. He's a serious unit Watson."
16,"Anderson to Watson, no run oh good ball here, some late movement away from the bat, Watson thinks about a cut and is beaten outside off"
17,"Anderson to Watson, no run another probing delivery, looks like it will be good Jimmy today, fullish, Watson plays around a defensive block a touch and it squirts to point"
18,"Anderson to Watson, no run this time Watson is more crisp and sure, blocking firmly to cover"
19,"Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson completes a good over with Watson full-facing it back to the bowler"
20,"Bresnan to Paine, no run good delivery this, Paine stretches forward and defends a touch uneasily"

23,"Bresnan to Watson, no run tidy stuff here, Bresnan jumps wide of the crease and angles this into Watson, who defends"
24,"Bresnan to Watson, no run the minute the ball is in his half, Watson really winds up for a big crisp drive, he really plays the shot well, but this time straight to a fielder at cover"
25,"Bresnan to Watson, 3 runs good shot I guess, Watson didn't time it at all, but with the field up the shot was on, it was a touch short from Bresnan and Watson tried to front-foot pull it, didn't get much of it but it went down to"

27,"Anderson to Watson, no run once again Watson plays this out the coaching manual, defending into the off side"
28,"Anderson to Watson, no run oops, really Watson should have punished this, a touch of width and Watson slashed hard at thin air"
29,"Anderson to Watson, no run bit of an appeal here from Anderson as he angled this into the stumps, Watson got an inside edge though, and it was probably going over the top. Not out really."
30,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs good response from Watson, top shot this, touch too short and wide from Anderson and Watson murdered it, thumping behind point for four"
31,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs two in two! Anderson goes full this time so Watson unleashes his big front-foot drive, banging it past Anderson for four more"

37,"Bresnan to Paine, no run very good, the two boundaries that ended the last over were followed by a maiden here from Bresnan, just restricting Australia's run rate"
38,"Broad to Watson, no run very accurate start from Broad, just outside off stump on a length and Watson defends"
39,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs well, it's a simple game, go full to Watson and be punished. That's exactly what happened here, it was full, Watson planted his front leg down the pitch and thumped it over cover for four"

46,"Bresnan to Watson, no run touch fuller this time, Watson rocks forward and blocks"

53,"Broad to Watson, 1 run nicely done from Watson, dabbing this into the leg side and scampering through for a swift single"
54,"Broad to Paine, 1 bye well done the pitch! Oval bounce here, it was a touch short and leapt up, over Paine's cut shot and carried on climbing, eventually bursting through Kieswetter's gloves"
55,"Broad to Watson, no run tidy finish to a tidy over, well defended by Watson"
56,"Bresnan to Paine, OUT all over for Paine! He's struggled today and it was a tame end. He tried to work it into the leg side, got a leading edge and looped very gently to Morgan at cover. Bresnan has his first wicket in the series"

72,"Bresnan to Ponting, FOUR runs glorious...so much for dodgy form as Ponting leans into a drive, on the up, which bisects cover and mid off. It wasn't a bad ball, just top batting"
73,"Bresnan to Ponting, 1 wide responds with a bouncer which is too short according to the umpire so he'll have to bowl that again"

88,"Broad to Ponting, no run full on middle stump, nicely driven down the on side but the mid-on is very straight and cuts it off"

100,"Swann to Watson, no run tossed up outside off, Watson leans forward and defends"
101,"Swann to Watson, OUT gone! Would you believe it, Watson has picked out deep midwicket with absolute precision as he went for a slog sweep. Eoin Morgan barely had to take step and Watson can barely drag himself away...he's been i"

236,"Anderson to White, FOUR runs well, it wasn't quite where bear-man White planned, but he'll take all of it, he aimed an enormous slog, it came off the outside edge, zipping wide of short third man for four"
237,"Anderson to White, 1 run this time he connects more fully, without much timing and collects one to mid on"
238,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke can't find a big shot here, but he does collect one to cover"
239,"Anderson to White, 1 run decent finish, but the earlier boundary made it a good over for Australia, here White digs out a yorker to cover and collects a single"
240,"Broad to White, no run White backs away, giving himself plenty of room to swing his big arms, but he can't quite time it and it trickles to cover"
241,"Broad to White, OUT gone this time! White couldn't quite going and here he tried to smash a short ball out the ground, couldn't get much of it and Anderson took an easy catch on the square leg boundary"
242,"Broad to Clarke, no run Clarke backs well away and Broad fires yorker well outside off, Clarke can't reach it, so oddly, it's a leave"
243,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run another slower ball bouncer, and once again it's not timed, I'm not sure I've seen any of these slow bouncers timed, Clarke pulls it down to deep square"
244,"Broad to Hussey, 1 run Hussey is away immediately, pushing down the ground for a single"
245,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run good finish to a good spell from Broad, as Clarke bunts it down the ground for one"
246,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run opens the face into the covers"
247,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run full and driven down to long-on which brings up the 200"
248,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, FOUR runs cuts hard at some width, slots it through the covers and it beats a sprawling Bresnan at deep cover...that was always out of reach, but he's not had the best day in the field"
249,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run down the pitch, drives in the air but one bounce to long-off"
250,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs elegantly flicked over midwicket, a nice flourish from Ponting, and long-on runs around to field"
251,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs steps back to leg, drives through the covers for another brace"
252,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run round the wicket, outside leg stump and flicked out to deep square"
253,"Yardy to Ponting, no run cramped for room and pushed back to the bowler"
254,"Yardy to Ponting, 1 run worked in the air but bounces well short of long-on"
255,"Yardy to Clarke, no run pushed out to midwicket"
256,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run drives past a diving Yardy down to long-off"
257,"Yardy to Ponting, 1 run driven hard along the ground through cover"
258,"Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke again has backed away and Anderson fires it in full outside off, Clarke can't reach it"
259,"Anderson to Clarke, OUT well, suicidal running from Hussey. Clarke murdered a drive straight to Strauss at extra cover, Hussey ran for a single which was never these, Strauss calmly threw back to Anderson, who took the bails off"
260,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run good bowling from Anderson, landing those old-fashioned, death-over yorkers and Clarke can only jab it down the ground for one"
261,"Anderson to Smith, 1 bye goodness me, if Smith had connected here this ball would still be travelling, slow bouncer, and an enormous swipe is missed, went one-bounce to Kieswetter who fumbled and allowed a bye"
262,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 wide oops! This must have just got stuck in Anderson's hands, it was so, so short, almost pitched on the bowler's feet, looped up miles over the batman, with enough time to collect a bye as well"
263,"Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs oh dear, poor ball this, short and down the leg side, Smith helped it on its way and collected four"
264,"Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs lovely shot to finish, really top shot, it was full and Smith whipped it into the gap in front of midwicket for four. Could be very important runs these last two balls"
265,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run Clarke gets a single straight away, might just be best for Australia that, mistiming a drive to mid off"
266,"Bresnan to Smith, 2 runs full and straight, good bowling, Smith squeezes out a drive and some top running allows him to come back for two"
267,"Bresnan to Smith, FOUR runs lovely shot, this innings could be a game-changer, he gets down on one knee and dinks it over the short fine leg for four"
268,"Bresnan to Smith, no run ha! well, he almost found the new gap, aiming a kind of switch-hit, but he couldn't connect"
269,"Bresnan to Smith, FOUR runs brilliant stuff this from Smith, conventional shot, just chipping a drive over cover and timing it perfectly to collect all four. Poor old Clarke will be stuck on 99"
270,"Bresnan to Smith, 1 bye good ball from Bresnan to finish, yorker, Smith aims big and misses, Kieswetter collects and they run a bye to reach 290"
271,"Brydon Coverdale has plenty more in his bulletin and, since we have a moment, I should point any Google Chrome users to our fancy Toolbar, so do enjoy that."
272,"Very good finish there for Australia, but overall they'd be a touch disappointed they couldn't push up to 300 after the platform laid by Ricky Ponting. Michael Clarke played superbly and deserved a century, but in a way was a victim of"
273,"Right, the players are heading back out. Strauss and Kieswetter stride to the crease to tones of 'Jerusalem', and it'll be Liam Brickhill to kick things off on commentary. Shaun Tait will open the bowling for Australia"
274,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide pace to start, but not much direction as he sprays one very wide of off stump from over the wicket"
275,"Tait to Strauss, no run much better, on a length and fired at off stump. Strauss hops back to defend"
276,"Tait to Strauss, no run shorter this time, not quite the bouncer but that leapt disconcertingly up at Strauss, who did very well to keep his eye on the ball and play it down"
277,"Tait to Strauss, 1 leg bye back of a length and very sharp. Strauss shapes to tuck the ball to leg but can't quite get it away, but Kieswetter calls him through for a quick single straight away"
278,"Tait to Kieswetter, 1 wide not quite adjusted to the change of line to the right-hander, as this one squirts down the leg side"
279,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run ooh, almost the delivery he got him with in the last game. Very full, and very fast, but Kieswetter punches to mid on with the full face of the bat"
280,"Tait to Kieswetter, FOUR runs width, and Kieswetter seizes upon it in fine fashion with a crunching cover drive. Right out the middle, and well-placed too, in the gap and away for four"
281,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run a touch of width again, but he pulled the length back and Kieswetter is quite happy to leave"
282,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run good start, on a length around off stump and Strauss defends back down the wicket"
283,"Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs too short, and Strauss is in position in a flash to thump a pull up and over midwicket. He trusts the bounce in the wicket and went through with the shot"
284,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run much fuller, and it's cracked to mid on"
285,"Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs slapped away behind square on the off side! Bollinger is just feeding Strauss's strengths here, giving him width outside off and he's laced away behind point as a result"
286,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run just keep it there! On a length, around off and nothing for Strauss to work with"
287,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run Strauss shapes to clip to leg but is too early in the shot and gets himself in a bit of a tangle, and the ball heads back down the wicket instead. Bollinger leaps across in his follow-through to cut i"
288,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run emotive appeal first ball as he sends one down full and the ball strikes pad then bat as Kieswetter defends. Too close for the umpire to pick though, so not out"
289,"Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run on a length, but on the hips and he's clipped to midwicket"
290,"Harris to Strauss, no run nice, accurate stuff from Harris as Strauss chops defensively to point"
291,"Harris to Strauss, no run fuller, and Strauss is drawn into a drive. Not quite there to be hit, though, and the ball goes softly to mid-off"
292,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run good fielding from Ponting saves runs! That was even fuller and again Strauss launched into a drive, timing it much better this time, but the 35-year-old in the covers tumbles athletically to his left to"
293,"Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs too straight, too full, and he's worked away to deep midwicket where Hussey cuts the ball off and hurls in a return"
294,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run a touch full on off stump, Strauss drives firmly to mid-off"
295,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run beaten outside off! Bollinger bends his back and finds some bounce outside off to beat a slightly airy woft by England's captain"
296,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run aggressive from Strauss, as he backs to leg and slaps the ball to cover. Just the one run though"
297,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run good stuff from Bollinger, as Kieswetter pushes at one angled across him and is beaten as well. He pulled the bat inside the line, but only after the ball was already past him"
298,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run a touch fuller, and Kieswetter presses forward to defend. Probing stuff so far from Bollinger"
299,"Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run full again, but pitching outside off and angled across him from over the wicket and Kieswetter raises his bat up and out of the way to leave"
300,"Harris to Strauss, no run Strauss is beaten again outside off, but this time the ball was there to be hit. Short and wide, you'd back Strauss to put that away, but it just bounced a fraction more than he was expecting"
301,"Harris to Strauss, no run Strauss misses a pull this time! Again, the shot was on, but now he plays over the top of it as the ball scoots over off stump"
302,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run full on off stump, Strauss drives strongly down the ground but mid-off runs round in a flash to cut it off cleanly and keep them to one"
303,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run watchful start from Kieswetter, who leaves alone outside off once again"
304,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run off the inside edge, going between his back leg and the stumps and down to short fine leg. That was too close for comfort..."
305,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run tight finish, zoning in on off stump and Kieswetter responds with a solid-looking forward defensive"
306,"Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs very fast to start... but short and wide, and Strauss slams a cut over backward point to pick up four!"
307,"Tait to Strauss, 2 runs dropped! It was a good ball just outside off, Strauss pushes at it and gets a thick edge which flies to Watto at first slip... but he can't hold on! The ball was really motoring, but he just couldn't wrap"
308,"Tait to Strauss, no run punched to cover off the back foot"
309,"Tait to Strauss, no run fuller this time, outside off, and driven - but straight to cover"
310,"Tait to Strauss, no run wow, this has been a very quick over from Tait - high 90s mph. Strauss is hurried into a prod to cover"
311,"Tait to Strauss, no run ah, the change-up to finish, as Tait sends down a slower-ball yorker outside off. I say slower, it was still around 80mph..."
312,"Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run tapped to midwicket, and he's immediately called through for a quick single"
313,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run on a length just outside off, and Strauss opens the face to send the ball to third man"
314,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run Harris has been exemplary so far, hurling the ball down at good pace but finding accuracy too - and Kieswetter defends again"
315,"Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run Kieswetter tries to relieve the pressure, shimmying to leg and flashing at the ball, which squirts off the outer half of the bat down to third man. Gully would've snaffled that"
316,"Harris to Strauss, no run beaten outside off! Wasn't there for the cut, but he went for a flashing front-foot square drive. A little bit of seam movement and the ball whizzed past the edge"
317,"Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs great intent from Strauss, as again he charges down the track to get to the pitch and cracks the ball very hard infront of square on the off side. Four runs! And shades of one Matty Hayden..."
318,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run back of a length and quick, but Kieswetter hops into a backfoot defensive and plays the ball down under his eyes"
319,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run shortish again, just outside off and Kieswetter pushes defensively to point"
320,"Tait to Kieswetter, no run fuller this time, and Kieswetter is simply beaten for pace as he pushes half-forward to drive but the ball is upon him before he's properly into the shot, and trickles into the off side"
321,"Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run feisty stuff! That was the bouncer, and was reasonably well-directed - not too short, and Kieswetter is hurried into a hook down to fine leg"
322,"Tait to Strauss, no run Strauss shuffles across to the off side and works the ball straight to midwicket"
323,"Tait to Strauss, no run full, and very fast indeed. Strauss pushes forward and opens the face to send the ball to backward point"
324,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run too straight, Kieswetter glances to leg but can't beat the man at short fine"
325,"Harris to Kieswetter, no run back of a length on off stump, and Kieswetter gets up on his toes to ride the bounce and defend to off"
326,"Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs nicely played by Kieswetter, the ball was similar to the one before but this time he just angled the bat face to send the ball to third man's right. Tait runs around, but in the meantime they pick up"
327,"Harris to Kieswetter, OUT clatter! Harris sent one down much fuller and Kieswetter went for the drive, leaving an enormous gap between bat and pad. There was a touch of wobble on the ball, and some seam movement in after pitching"
328,"Harris to Pietersen, no run on a length, Pietersen moves nicely across and defends back down the track"
329,"Harris to Pietersen, no run slightly fuller, punched firmly to mid-off"
330,"Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs a touch straight, and Strauss nudges him away behind square on the leg side."
331,"Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs so he sends one down short and wide on the off side, and Strauss cracks a cut right out of the middle of the bat to send the ball racing to the backward point boundary"
332,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run closer to the stumps, and Strauss opens the face of the blade to guide the ball behind square on the off side"
333,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs crack! Full, wide, and Pietersen absolutely hammers a drive through the covers. The ball raced to the boundary in a flash!"
334,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs he pulls the length back a touch, but Pietersen drives on the up straight down the ground, beating a diving Ponting at mid-on! Two in two"
335,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run thumped down the ground again! But that's clattered into the stumps at the non-striker's end, and the crowd let out a collective groan as the ball goes nowhere..."
336,"Harris to Strauss, no run on a length, straight and pushed to mid-on"
337,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run well, an uncharacteristically ungainly pull from Strauss as Harris sends one down a bit shorter. He found himself in no position to play the shot but just went through with it. That was a bit hoicky..."
338,"Harris to Pietersen, OUT Harris strikes again! Pietersen went right across to the offside and aimed an extravagant flick over the leg-side but is struck on the back pad. Huge appeal from Australia, and the umpire agrees! Pieters"
339,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run nurdle to leg, and he's off the mark straight away"
340,"Harris to Strauss, no run on a length on off stump, tapped defensively to cover"
341,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run chopped down just behind square, backward point ran in but they committed to the single and it's safe in the end"
342,"Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs just too straight, and Strauss nudges through midwicket, placing the ball well enough to warrant a second"
343,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run back of a length on off, Strauss tries to guide the ball to third man but can't beat the man at gully"
344,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run little shuffle to off, and worked to midwicket for one"
345,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run very full outside off from over the wicket, Collingwood drives but the ball squirts off the toe-end of the bat and trickles to mid-off"
346,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run Colly walks right across to the off side this time and unleashes a nurdle to leg, but straight to the fielder"
347,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run walks across his stumps once again, and punches firmly to mid-on. More orthordox, less nurdley"
348,"Harris to Strauss, 2 runs worked to leg, in front of deep midwicket and so they charge through for the second. He couldn't pick the ball up cleanly anyway, so easy runs in the end"
349,"Harris to Strauss, no run clipped straight to the close midwicket this time"
350,"Harris to Strauss, no run chopped to gully, Colly was thinking about the cheeky single but Strauss sends him back"
351,"Harris to Strauss, 1 run Strauss shuffles down the track and drives firmly past the straightish midwicket, but a deep-ish mid-on sprints round to cut the ball off"
352,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full, driven very hard on the up but straight to extra cover"

354,"Tait to Strauss, no run goes full to start, and Strauss drives a little leaden-footed to extra cover"
355,"Tait to Strauss, OUT edged and gone! Well, that curved away from Strauss very late to take the edge of his bat, and Paine takes a regulation catch behind. Tait strikes, and Australia continue to chip away at England as they chas"

362,"Hopes to Morgan, no run straight, and Morgan defends back down the track"
363,"Hopes to Morgan, SIX runs thumped! Morgan is in a confident mood, as Hopes sends one down fuller and he lifts it handsomely way over long-on. Effortless, all balance and timing"

365,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 2 runs punched firmly to mid-off, where Bollinger just about cuts it off"
366,"Tait to Morgan, no run Morgan is content at the moment to leave Tait's rockets alone outside off stump"
367,"Tait to Morgan, no run this is swift stuff from Tait and Morgan hurries into a defensive block"
368,"Tait to Morgan, no run no slower-ball bouncers from Tait, just full and very very quick, Morgan eases into a forward defence"
369,"Tait to Morgan, no run this was a short one, but there was nothing slow about it, England look like they've decided to see Tait out, and Morgan sways out the way of it"
370,"Tait to Morgan, no run this is actually short and wide outside off, I reckon any other bowler and Morgan would have had a dart at it, instead he leaves it alone"
371,"Tait to Morgan, no run angles it across Morgan, who eagerly shoulders arms, which means Tait has bowled two maidens in a row now"
372,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run Hopes lands his busy right-arm medium on and around off stump, Collingwood must recognise the bowling as reminiscent of his own, and guides it to third man for one"
373,"Hopes to Morgan, no run good ball here, nothing for Morgan to latch on to, so instead it's tapped gently back to the bowler"
374,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 run drifting a fraction down the leg side, Morgan tickles it round the corner for one"

379,"Smith to Morgan, 1 run this time it's more secure from Morgan, chipping down the crease again and working it for a single in front of square on the leg side"
380,"Smith to PD Collingwood, no run good ball from Smith, classic legspinner's stock, pitching around leg, spinning away, Collingwood is forward and blocks"
381,"Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run too short and Collingwood cuts, firmly, but to the deep point fielder"

387,"Hopes to Morgan, no run nothing here, just dabbed into the cover region"
388,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 leg bye once again Morgan looking for the leg-side whip, but can't connect and it thuds off the pads for a single"
389,"Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run touch slower from Hopes and Collingwood eases it down to long on for a strike-stealing single"
390,"Smith to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Collingwood committed to a sweep very early, but played the shot superbly, picking a gap at fine, fine leg and dabbing it just where he planned for four"
391,"Smith to PD Collingwood, OUT great response from Smith and Collingwood has gone! Top stuff from Smith, but Collingwood looks unlucky here, he pushed forward to defend and the ball rapped him on the front pad, looked outside the"
392,"Smith to Yardy, 1 run Yardy starts well enough, pushing into the covers for one"

423,"Hopes to Yardy, 1 bye nicely bowled from Hopes, a touch slower outside off and Yardy was through his drive too quickly, Paine, standing up to the stumps, couldn't collect cleanly, so they stole a bye"
424,"Hopes to Morgan, 1 run fuller here and Morgan bunted it down the ground for a gentle single"
425,"Hopes to Yardy, 1 run Hopes round the wicket this time, trying to cramp Yardy for room, it works, in a way, but the mistimed cut trickles for a swift single"

431,"Bollinger to Yardy, no run Yardy is shuffling all over the place, eventually he ends up in an orthodox position, but duly plays and misses"
