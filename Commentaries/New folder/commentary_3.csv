0,7.00pm Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat
1,"Turner to Mohammad Naim, 1 run fullish length on middle, he tucks it to square leg and they complete a rapid run"
2,"Turner to Soumya, no run leading edge to cover, but safe. Fuller on middle and leg, and he looks to flick but gets an edge toward the off side"
3,"Turner to Soumya, no run much quicker and shorter on off, turning into the batter. Pushed toward midwicket"
4,"Turner to Soumya, no run full ball on middle and leg, pushed toward mid-on"
5,"Turner to Soumya, no run is that a stumping? The square leg umpire goes upstairs. Good length ball pitched on middle, and angling into the batter. He goes for the clip, but replays show the ball just disturbed the edge of his front pad. And momentum took his back leg in the air as Wade dislodged the bails"
6,"Turner to Soumya, 1 run difficult catch dropped at square leg. Carey leaps and gets a hand, but can't get hold of it. Soumya heaves across the line to this full ball on middle and off, but gets it off the inside half of the bat. The ball eventually trickles toward deep square leg, as they sneak a single"

10,"Hazlewood to Soumya, no run Short of a length just outside off, and he goes for the pull but is beaten with the ball seaming away from the left-hander. Not in control of that shot, as he seemed to have played too early while the ball really took off from the surface"
11,"Hazlewood to Soumya, 1 run good length ball on middle and off, and he taps to third man from close to his body"
12,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, OUT thin edge behind, and gone! A very Test match-like ball to get the first man out. Fullish length on middle with what seemed like a hint of movement away first, but eventually held its line as the batter tried to open the bat face and guide that down to third man. The ball too"
13,"Zampa to Soumya, OUT appeal for leg before, and the umpire takes his time to give that out! But Soumya reviews. Soumya goes for the sweep first ball against the legspinner, who pitches it full on middle and leg. The ball turned a little into the left-hander, who was hit on the front pad. No inside edge is c"
14,"Zampa to Mahmudullah, no run full ball on off, and this was a googly. Defended off the inside half of the bat to the on side"

21,"Hazlewood to Mahmudullah, 1 run short fine leg dives to his left, but safe. Christian got a hand, but that will go down as a drop. Good length ball on middle and leg, as he flicked but got it off the inside half of the bat. Christian was going to his wrong side, and so it would always have been difficult"
22,"Hazlewood to Shakib, no run squares him up! Another good length ball on middle and leg, angling away as Shakib is complete beaten with the bounce and the swing. Excellent ball"
23,"Hazlewood to Shakib, 1 run goes deep in his crease to push that fullish ball on middle and leg to square leg"

30,"Agar to Mahmudullah, no run short of a length on middle, and cut to cover. The batter misses out on an opportunity there"

35,"Ellis to Shakib, no run much fuller on middle and off, at just 115kph. Taps to the covers, and wants a run. But is denied by the non-striker"
36,"Ellis to Shakib, FOUR runs top edge, but flies over the keeper. Goes for the pull to this shortish ball on off, but it is not all that short to play the pull. Nevertheless, Wade can only see the ball sail to his left for four"

49,"Zampa to Shakib, OUT taken by long-off running forward! Zampa strikes first ball of his second over as well. Tosses it up full and outside off, as Shakib makes room to try and loft that over the bowler's head. Agar at long-off runs forward, and completes a good take while bending low as well"

124,9.07pm Can you have it any better? A debut hat-trick from Ellis means Australia need only 128 to keep the series alive.

210,"Shoriful Islam to Henriques, OUT chipped straight mid-on! He can make amends, that's for sure. Full and straight, Henriques trying to clear the leg side - I think - but just presents a simple chance. Seemed a little in two minds with the shot"

228,"Shoriful Islam to Marsh, OUT high the air, taken at long-off! Wild celebrations for Bangladesh. Short of a length, Marsh tried to go down the ground but it skewed off the bat. Long-off, Naim, did well to make the ground in and take the catch. Is that the game?"
