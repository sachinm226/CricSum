0,South African have won the toss and chosen to chase.
1,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs back of a length, bit of width, 84mph/135kph and Warner carves it away through the covers off the back foot! Bit of a freebie to start, nicely timed with a cross bat"
2,"Steyn to Warner, OUT Warner goes second ball, and Steyn is pumped! Length ball, plenty of bounce, found the top edge as he looked to flick it into the leg side, and it flew up to Shamsi at long leg on the boundary. Steyn brings out a slow-motion chainsaw celebration, and Warner looks disgruntled at the extent to which that shot up from a length"
3,"Steyn to Finch, FOUR runs bludgeoned through the covers for four!"
4,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run length outside off, looks to guide it through the off side and inside edges down to long leg"
5,"Steyn to Smith, no run wide length ball outside the off stump, fenced out to cover on the edge of the ring"
6,"Steyn to Smith, no run slower ball, slightly full of a length. Holds in the pitch, Smith pushes into the off side"
7,"Ngidi to Finch, FOUR runs width outside the off stump, sits up, and Finch flays it through cover point for four! Imperious"
8,"Ngidi to Finch, no run short ball, looks to tuck it into the leg side but it strikes the body and dribbles down at his feet"
9,"Ngidi to Finch, 3 runs length outside off, punched through the covers off the back foot. Du Plessis races after it, and brings out a big dive to cut it off"
10,"Ngidi to Smith, no run length outside off, 86mph/139kph, Smith shuffles across looking to hoick from outside off and through midwicket, but can't lay bat on it"
11,"Ngidi to Smith, no run back of a length outside off, looks to crunch through the covers off the back foot but is through the shot early. Skews into the off side off the bat"
12,"Ngidi to Smith, FOUR runs short and wide outside the off stump, cut uppishly down to Steyn on the third-man boundary, but he loses sight of it right at the last moment and it flies over his right shoulder! Looks like he lost it in the floodlights, didn't make any attempt to catch it!"
13,"Steyn to Finch, no run slower ball, Finch looks to flick through square leg but is struck on the thigh pad. Down at 69mph/110kph"
14,"Steyn to Finch, no run length ball in the channel, fended out to cover on the back foot"
15,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run dipping slower ball, turns into a low full toss, and clipped out to midwicket. This was the very slow slower ball, down at 74mph, which he foxed Bairstow with in the England series. Hard to pick out the hand"
16,"Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs full and wide, Smith throws everything at it and slashes it through backward point for four!"
17,"Steyn to Smith, 1 run driven out to mid-off for one"
18,"Steyn to Finch, FOUR runs length, wide outside off, opens the face and flays it through point for four! Crunched, great shot"
19,"Rabada to Smith, SIX runs back-of-a-length outside off, Smith throws plenty at this looking to slug over midwicket, top-edged it over third man for six! That's what altitude will do..."
20,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run steered down to third man"
21,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR runs steep bounce, Finch is cramped for room but jabs his bat at it and guides it down to third man for a one-bounce four! Shaping to cut, done for pace but enough on it"

23,"Rabada to Finch, no run length on leg stump, tickled round the corner to Shamsi on the 45"

25,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run back of a length, tucked out to square leg off the hip"
26,"Ngidi to Finch, no run back of a length, steps outside leg and drives out to extra cover on the back foot. Hurls down the stumps at the non-striker's, but Smith is comfortably in"
27,"Ngidi to Finch, FOUR runs back of a length, pulled very hard in front of square and away for four! Powerful shot, sat back in his crease and nailed it in front of the man out on the fence"
28,"Ngidi to Finch, FOUR runs slower ball outside off, waits back in his crease and nails it over extra cover! Too short, Finch flings his bat at it and middles it for a one-bounce four"

30,"Ngidi to Finch, SIX runs full and straight, Finch lofts straight down the ground for six! Straight bat, opened up to get leg side of the ball, and launched over mid-off for an 82m maximum"
31,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, FOUR runs wide outside the off stump, throws his hands at it, and it races away through backward point for four. Smith had so much time, transferred his weight onto the back foot and it sat up nicely off the pitch"

33,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, no run shuffles across to the off side, looks to guide it through point but inside edges towards midwicket"
34,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, FOUR runs fullish outside off, Smith throws plenty at it looking to go through extra cover but inside edges past leg stump and away for four!"
35,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, no run beaten all ends up! Not quite sure how that missed... came back into the right-hander, and cut him in half, jagging between the bat and the back leg, bouncing just over the top!"
36,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, FOUR runs short and wide outside off, adjusts his weight and flays this through point for four! Absolutely thumped, not a great ball and Smith nails it over the man in the ring"
37,"Shamsi to Finch, 1 run full to start, whipped out to square leg, de Kock races after it to stop the second"
38,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide legbreak, flatter, but down the leg side"
39,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide down the leg side again, Shamsi under the pump. Short boundary is on the off side, hence this line"

53,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 run fairly flat, slightly full of a length outside off, steered towards cover point"
54,"Shamsi to Finch, OUT Finch steps outside leg, Shamsi follows him, he throws everything through the shot regardless but can't time it. Faf du Plessis settles underneath it at deep midwicket, and takes a good catch on the rope! Just about stayed inside the rope, and that breaks a very useful partnership"
55,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide down the leg side, another wide"
56,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 run pushed out for a single"
57,"Shamsi to Wade, 2 runs legbreak, good turn, carved out to deep cover off the back foot"

60,"Smuts to Smith, 1 run pushed out to mid-off for a jogged single"
61,"Smuts to Wade, FOUR runs launched high, high, very high into the night sky towards deep midwicket... and dropped by van Biljon the debutant! Not the easiest chance, and there was some miscommunication with Rabada... Wade slog-swept, top-edged, and gets a life"

66,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide, OUT length ball, down the leg side again and Smith uses his feet looking to work through midwicket... he can't lay bat on it, and de Kock whips the bails off! Think Shamsi saw him coming, dragged it down the leg side, and that's a very sharp stumping made to look easy by QdK. Huge moment!"
67,"Shamsi to Carey, 1 run full outside off, Carey gets down to sweep out to deep backward square"
68,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run length ball, cramps him up, chipped out to midwicket"
69,"Shamsi to Carey, no run slightly full outside off, looks to cut but it keeps a touch low and hits the bottom of the bat"

71,"Shamsi to Carey, SIX runs slog sweeps out to deep midwicket, van der Dussen is in the game on the rope... but can only tip it over the bar! At full stretch, leaping, but can only get fingertips on it"
72,"Shamsi to Carey, no run length ball, sharp bounce, and edged behind! No, Paleker doesn't like it! SA review almost immediately. Rocked back looking to cut ... nothing on UltraEdge! Great decision, SA were convinced but they must have been deceived by another noise. Carey survives."

102,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run length outside off, carved out to deep cover"
103,"Phehlukwayo to Carey, OUT full on off stump, Carey throws everything at it but it flies straight up into the air... Faf sets himself at backward point, it comes down with snow on it but he takes an excellent catch before falling onto his back! Relief, after what seemed like an eternity under the high ball"

117,"Steyn to Wade, OUT slower ball, length outside off, huge blow high into the air, but it's not got the distance on it to clear the long side of the ground... Miller settles underneath it at deep midwicket, and takes the catch! De Kock's aggressive move does the trick as Steyn strikes"

127,"Rabada to Agar, FOUR runs fullish outside off, slashed between extra cover and mid-off and away for four! Cleared the front dog, and carved into the gap"
128,"Rabada to Agar, SIX runs all the way this time! In the slot, Agar sits deep in the crease and slugs it just over mid-off"

133,"7.37pm: 196 for 6 - nowhere near as many as it might have been from a platform of 70 for 1 after the first six, but a useful total nonetheless. Finch and Smith got Australia off to a fast start, before Marsh, Carey and Agar's cameos dragged them up to a pretty useful score, that I would guess is slightly above par. South Africa were profligate, giving away 12 wides, and some of the fielding"
134,"""196 off 22 overs"" chimes Roger Walker. How costly will those wides prove?"
135,Alan Gardner will be here in 10 minutes or so to take you through the run chase.
136,"""How many times in t20s has every batsman hit a 4 or 6 but no one make a 50?"" Probably more often than you think, Henry (aka. I have no idea)"
137,"Hello, everyone. That was a reasonably satisfying thrash from Australia - a little disjointed but they got up to a pretty decent score. Can South Africa produce some unrelenting pongo of their own, or is it going to be three T20I defeats on the spin?"
138,"Here come the Australians, who it's worth noting haven't lost in this format since 2018. Mitchell Starc to start up from the Corlett Drive End, one slip in"
139,"Starc to de Kock, 2 runs shortish outside off, 136kph/84mph and offering de Kock a little width as he chops through backward point, well stopped on the rope by the diving Mitchell Marsh"
140,"Starc to de Kock, no run hard length, 136kph in the channel, punched square this time"
141,"Starc to du Plessis, no run swing again, struck on the back pad... umpire Holdsworth not taken with the appeal, though! Maybe a touch high? Starc already a menace here"

153,"Starc to du Plessis, 1 wide pitched full, 144kph/89mph and angling across, too far across for the umpire's liking"
154,"Starc to du Plessis, no run back of a length outside off and whistling through as du Plessis attempts to ride the bounce"
155,"Starc to du Plessis, FOUR runs short on the pads, 143kph and he uses the pace to his advantage, smuggled down to fine leg for four! First boundary for du Plessis"
156,"Cummins to van der Dussen, no run back of a length, 139kph/87mph and kicking to hit high up the bat as RVD? defends on off stump"
157,"Cummins to van der Dussen, OUT slapped straight up, h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h towards third man... and taken by Starc! He had to plunge forward as the ball threatened to land short of him, but held it well, a spiralling chance into the Joburg night sky as RVD? flung the hands at a miscued drive. Cummins strikes second ball"
158,"Cummins to du Plessis, no run shortish, nipping back to take the inside edge and then kiss du Plessis on the inside thigh... Kiss like a rottweiler, that is"

170,"Cummins to Smuts, 1 run tip and run to mid-off, Warner swoops and this could be tight... but he misses, when a direct hit would have left Smuts well short!"
171,"Cummins to du Plessis, 1 run short ball, whirled on the pull towards short fine leg, Zampa cuts it off"
172,"Cummins to Smuts, OUT top-edged on the pull, this is going to be a tough one... but Zamps holds it running back! The ball stayed up for an age, after Smuts failed to get hold of it, and Zampa must have been running around in circles from short fine leg, as he suddenly shot into view and grabbed on, before falling back and slamming his head into the turf. But he seems okay, and SA are"
