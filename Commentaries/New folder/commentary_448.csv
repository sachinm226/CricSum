0,2 pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and will have a bat.
1,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run going across Tharanga from a length, not much pace first up, and left alone easily"
2,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run more pace on this one now from Lee, 134.7 kph, much fuller too, Tharanga is not particularly to the pitch and pushes carefully to mid off"
3,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run goes back of a length now, so three different lengths in three deliveries from Lee, Tharanga keeps it down on the leg side and Lee rushes forward to field"
4,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run Lee puts more effort in a shortish one, hits Tharanga hard on the bat as he pushes towards cover"
5,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run pitched up and heading for off stump, 137.9 kph, Tharanga blocks with a straight bat, just a touch late in getting bat down"
6,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run opens the bat face late and runs a back of a length ball around middle to point, nothing in terms of width from Lee"
7,"Bollinger to Dilshan, no run he is on target right away too, around that off stump, going across, Dilshan shuffles around and pushes towards point"
8,"Bollinger to Dilshan, 1 run more bounce as he goes back of a length, Dilshan pushes purposefully in front of cover with an open face and they take the first run of the game"
9,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run Dougie gets the angle going, in the left-hander from short of a length, and he takes it on the body as he misses the work on the leg side"
10,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run now he goes outside off stump, Dougie, and gets lots of bounce as it moves away from back of a length, Tharanga tried to go on the toes and cut but the bounce beat him"
11,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, FOUR runs tharanga gets going with an inside edge, oh well, what's new you say, throws his bat from the crease at one close to off stump, but it goes fine on the leg side past the keeper"
12,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run bit of away shape for Dougie, but this time Tharanga leaves outside off"
13,"Lee to Dilshan, 1 run shortish and he latches on to the pull right away, keeps it along the ground through square leg too, rolling his wrists over the ball"
14,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, 1 run plays late, well done, allows the length ball to come in with the angle, and drops it towards midwicket"
15,"Lee to Dilshan, no run Dilshan looking for the swat-punch through extra cover, Lee bowls a slower one back of a length, and Dilshan cannot get any timing on the shot"
16,"Lee to Dilshan, 1 run well played, but Ponting at backward point rolls back the years with a dive to his left and a one-handed stop, Dilshan had used Lee's pace very well to open the face and push through the line, that was travelling"
17,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run some width outside off but tharanga finds Ponting this time with the cut"
18,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run even more width, and much fuller outside off, Tharanga eagerly goes on the front foot to bash it through extra cover but hits it back down the track as he gets too across"
19,"Bollinger to Dilshan, no run the ball is coming on nicely, but Dilshan's push finds short extra cover as he gets forward to a length ball going across"
20,"Bollinger to Dilshan, no run Doug is finding a lot of bounce from this harmless looking pitch, beats Dilshan who has a go at one leaving him with the angle"
21,"Bollinger to Dilshan, FOUR runs clobber! that is in Dilshan's slot, pitched up, wide and full outside off, he gets forward and cracks it off the middle through extra cover, bothering to run? don't"
22,"Bollinger to Dilshan, no run similar delivery, and Dilshan gets forward to thump it again, not that wide though, and he cannot time the shot, is pretty cross with himself and waves the bat in disgust"
23,"Bollinger to Dilshan, no run shortish delivery and Dilshan shapes up for the pull, he is late on the shot as Dougie finds some pace on it and hits it on the bounce to short midwicket"
24,"Bollinger to Dilshan, FOUR runs width available and Dilshan goes after it, thick outside edge but it has flown to the third man boundary"
25,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, 1 run he is playing Lee with the angle as he comes from round the stumps, and works him towards square leg"
26,"Lee to Dilshan, no run looks to pounce on one just outside off stump but mistimes it towards covers"
27,"Lee to Dilshan, 1 run straight on middle stump, Dilshan pushes in front of mid on and takes off for the single"
28,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run nast bouncer from Lee and he gives the look to Tharanga as well, angled in from wide of the crease, gets big on Tharanga and almost hits him near the throat, he just manages to get out of the way"
29,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, 1 run well done, arching back and using the angle from a length to steer to third man"
30,"Lee to Dilshan, no run 136.3 kph from Lee, and Dilshan goes pushing in the air off the front foot, ball falls short of the man at mid off, not quite driving length but he he had a go"
31,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run tries to use the pace to guide a back of a length ball it wide of point but hits it straight to the man"
32,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run beats him outside off stump, straightish one on a length, holding its line just a bit as Doug slows it down, Tharanga came forward but the lack of pace did him and he had a loose prod at it"
33,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run worked on the leg side off the pads"
34,"Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, 1 run they take on midwicket for the single, as there is a fumble there, and make it safely in the end as the throw from David Hussey is wide of the keeper"
35,"Bollinger to Dilshan, OUT there is no getting away this time, Doug's bounce has done Dilshan, he has been getting it to take off consistently, Dilshan's instinct is to go after it as it bounces close to off stump, too high he finds out as he gets an edge on its way to Haddin"
36,"Bollinger to Sangakkara, 4 leg byes he has ducked right in to the bouncer, Doug is really troubling them with the short of a length balls, it did not get up outside off as much as Sanga expected and he rammed his helmet in to it as he got down, it went past the slip"
37,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run in to the left-hander with the angle, and defended towards cover"
38,"Lee to Upul Tharanga, OUT Lee has gone through Tharanga, pretty ordinary shot and the stumps are splattered, it was the slower one from Lee, 125.3 kph, full and on the stumps, Tharanga just had a huge heave at it, and played all over it"

42,"Lee to Sangakkara, no run carefully gets forward and defends one hurled in fuller from round the stumps close to off"
43,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, no run slants it across Mahela from a length, it is just a touch wide outside off, and he lets it go"
44,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, no run another one going across Mahela at 128.4 kph, that looked faster than that, Mahela shoulders arms"
45,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run slowish one at 114.9 kph on middle, Mahela waits on the crease and twirls the blade to pick up a single on the leg side close to the pitch"
46,"Bollinger to Sangakkara, 1 leg bye on the pads from Doug with the angle and Sanga shuffles across to flick it to long leg, the Australians think there was something to it, it would have gone down leg"
47,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, no run the short ball from Doug again, rises on Mahela who goes on his toes to keep it down, could do with a short leg probably"
48,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Mahela shows all his touch and class now, forward to a pitched up ball and caresses it past cover, lovely straight followthrough, no violence, no furious shuffling"

66,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run bounces from back of a length, he opens the face to push towards point"

83,"Watson to Sangakkara, 1 run cuts in from outside off stump, but is a touch shortish and is slapped away to sweeper cover"
84,"Watson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run goes on the toes to keep a rising one down on the off side"
85,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run well bowled, Mitch lets the near-yorker rip right on middle, not completely in the blockhole, and Sanga is able to dig it out"
86,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run now the slower one, 121.1 kph outside off and he mistimes the push to mid on"

148,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run and again, floated wider and moving away further, Mahela moves across and goes for another drive, Haddin takes it diving to his right, Australia are sure there was an edge, umpire Asoka is equally sure there wasn't, Australia go for the review, the bat is nowhere near the ball, it was the sound of bat hitting ground but the ball was quite a few inches away"

155,"Doherty to Sangakkara, OUT Sanga goes this time, he comes down the track, and does what he had been wanting to for quite some time, gets to the pitch and connects well with the lofted shot, but he has got it too flat and Lee takes a fine tumbling catch at long on, so Doherty breaks the stand for Australia, it had started to assume slightly worrisome proportions"
156,"Doherty to Silva, no run pushed away on the off side, it was short and turning away, but he mistimed the cut"
157,"Doherty to Silva, OUT another one, Doherty strikes again, Silva has gone for nothing, pushing forward to one pitching on the off stump, it does not turn and goes on with the angle, he plays for it, outside the line as a result, is struck on the pads, and is given right away, that would have hit leg"
158,"Doherty to Angelo Mathews, 1 run flat one outside off stump, he cuts it off the back foot to sweeper cover"

168,"Bollinger to Eranga, 1 run gives him the short ball, he awkwardly jabs it away on the leg side behind square"
169,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, no run going across Mahela on a length, around off, and he comes forward to defend"
170,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, no run chopped from the crease on the bounce to backward point"
171,"Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs fine stroke from Mahela, he played a similar one at the start of his innings, forward to one going across and caresses it past extra cover, elegance all the way"
172,"Lee to Eranga, OUT and gets one first ball, Eranga tries to hop in the air and cut a bouncing short one outside off, picks out third man who does not have to move at all"

176,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs drives a pitched up delivery wide of sweeper cover and acknowledges the applause for a pain-staking 50"

178,"Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, no run going straight on from a fuller length on off, blocked off the front foot"
179,"Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, no run flighted full on leg stump, some turn this time, as Mahela defends"
180,"Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run pushes a tossed up ball outside off away from the body in front of point"
181,"Doherty to Prasanna, no run pushes a away a flat delivery towards point"
182,"Doherty to Prasanna, OUT is that another one, Prasanna goes for the review as umpire Hill gives him out leg before, it was the tossed up ball that carried straight in, he pushed outside the line and was struck on the pad, that would have hit middle and off, and Sri Lanka have lost the review, best figures for Xavier Doherty"
183,"Doherty to Malinga, no run tossed up invitingly but Malinga lets it go outside off"
184,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run short of a length, Jayawardene is behind it in defence"
185,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run nearly chips a low full toss down mid-on's throat. Doesn't make the best of connections, which is just as well"
186,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Binga! Accurate bouncer, Jayawardene looks for the flick-pull, gets a top edge, and Lee runs towards square leg to complete the catch. Huge wicket, Jayawardene could still have hurt Australia"
187,"Lee to Malinga, OUT right through him, backing away, Lee keeps it full, moving in late on the stumps, Malinga goes nowhere with the swipe and that is the end of the innings"
188,"On another note, Sri Lanka's capitulation has covered up Australia's woeful over-rate. They had more than 11 overs to bowl with barely 25 minutes left"
189,"With Silva out of touch, they had five batsmen. Two fell to wild shots, the third found the fielder on his first aggressive shot and the fourth charged blindly as soon as he came in. Too much left for the fifth to do, even if he is of the class of Mahela Jayawardene"
190,"This is the fourth-lowest total in a completed first innings in a full game at the Premadasa, and the second-lowest for Sri Lanka. Sums up their performance. They were playing with a long tail today, and Chamara Silva as well, who clearly hasn't got any confidence going. 0, 6, 7, 1, 0, 0 read the scores of the last six batsmen.
