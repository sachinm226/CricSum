0,5.30pm Australia have won the toss and will bat
1,"Rabada to Khawaja, 2 runs full at middle and off, neatly flicked away through straight midwicket...nice piece of timing to start with"
2,"Rabada to Khawaja, 1 wide very full, slips down past leg stump and called wide"
3,"Rabada to Khawaja, no run full outside off, 142mph, he walks into a drive which finds mid-off"
4,"Rabada to Khawaja, 1 run driven on the up this time, behind square on the off side, but backward point is able to cut it off"
5,"Rabada to Finch, no run keeps it full outside off, not much footwork as he drives and gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
6,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR runs that's trademark Finch, a punchy, lofted straight drive to a pretty good delivery - at 146kph and just back of a length - and it goes a couple of bounces over the rope"
7,"Rabada to Finch, no run good comeback, a yorker, dug out back to the bowler"
8,"Abbott to Khawaja, FOUR runs nice placement, comes onto the front foot and drives square through the overs...finds the gap wide if point"
9,"Abbott to Khawaja, no run short ball outside off, angled across, Khawaja goes for the pull and is beaten on the under edge as the ball dies somewhat off the surface"
10,"Abbott to Khawaja, no run same again, almost identical as Abbott bangs it in back of a length and Khawaja is defeat by the slowness off the surface...goes on the second bounce to de Kock"
11,"Abbott to Khawaja, no run three strikes, but he isn't out...angled across, back of a length outside off, Khawaja wafting at a lot of fresh air at the moment"
12,"Abbott to Khawaja, 1 run fuller this time, outside off, he drives away from his body and gets a thick outside edge down to third man"
13,"Abbott to Finch, 1 run goes down the pitch and across the pitch, Abbott is back of a length and Finch pulls into the leg side without any timing"
14,"Rabada to Finch, SIX runs this time he clears the boundary! Takes this delivery, which is full outside off, over wide mid-on as the bottom hand comes into play and the bat face closes. Good connection"
15,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run back of a length, Finch adjusts and taps into the covers"
16,"Rabada to Khawaja, 1 run full outside off, clubbed towards mid-on who is deep enough to allow the single"
17,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run short at the body, he pulls sweetly off his hip but Tahir does well at short fine-leg to cut off what would have been a certain boundary"
18,"Rabada to Khawaja, OUT picks him out! Deep square leg barely had to move...a short ball, Khawaja went for the pull and didn't try to keep it down. A lot of effort for not much reward in that stay. Neat catch by Wiese"
19,"Rabada to Warner, no run very full outside off, 151kph and does Warner for pace as he jabs over the top of the delivery. Good wheels from Rabada"
20,"Abbott to Finch, 1 run flicked away from outside off behind square on the leg side"
21,"Abbott to Warner, FOUR runs throws his hands through this, wide outside off, no holding back and Warner was able to free his arms over point"
22,"Abbott to Warner, no run back of a length outside off, Warner steps back towards leg stump and thumps this towards mid-off"
23,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run tucked into the leg side to deep square"
24,"Abbott to Finch, no run driven on the up to cover"
25,"Abbott to Finch, 1 run back of a length outside off, Finch stands tall and punches to the left of mid-off"
26,"Duminy to Finch, SIX runs round the wicket and that's deposited over deep midwicket, Finch goes down on his back knee and slog sweeps with terrific power which overcame the fact it came high off the bat"
27,"Duminy to Finch, SIX runs that's huge again! The spectators at deep midwicket in danger. It's a quicker, shorter, delivery which Finch rocks back to and pulls high and handsome"
28,"Duminy to Finch, SIX runs three in a row! Hold on, folks. This is an awful full toss which Finch dispatches into the stands over deep midwicket again"
29,"Duminy to Finch, FOUR runs almost six, just a few meters short...Duminy fired it miles outside off, Finch did very well to even reach the ball and someone manages to flat-bat it over cover"
30,"Duminy to Finch, no run quick and slung in towards leg stump, he goes for the sweep and gets taken on the pad. A dot ball."
31,"Duminy to Finch, 2 runs wide outside off again, Finch giving himself room to the leg side but again manages to reach the ball with the toe end of the bat. Gets enough on it to clear mid-off. That might be Duminy done for the day"
32,"Morris to Warner, FOUR runs short of a length and that's a very nice piece of placement from Warner as he flips it off his hip backward of square on the leg side"
33,"Morris to Warner, no run comes round the wicket, back of a length outside off, crunched to cover"
34,"Morris to Warner, FOUR runs gets this over mid-off, it's a touch fuller from Morris, Warner stays in his crease and just drills through the line to comfortably clear the in-field"
35,"Morris to Warner, no run not far away from dragging this on as Morris goes shorter, Warner pulls and gets a thick bottom edge which puts backspin on the ball and nearly sees it roll into the stumps"
36,"Morris to Warner, SIX runs this goes very high, and has the distance as well...back of a length, Warner pulls off the front foot, the angle is coming into him from round the wicket and clears deep midwicket"
37,"Morris to Warner, 1 run down the pitch, he's on one leg when he cracks this to cover"
38,"Wiese to Warner, OUT strikes first ball! Over the wicket, short of a length outside off, and Warner ends up steering this straight to backward point where Duminy takes a good low catch. He went for placement rather than brute force this time"
39,"Wiese to Smith, no run full outside off, Smith comes forward and defends to the covers"
40,"Wiese to Smith, 1 run keeps it full, Smith gently pushes to back past the bowler towards long off"
41,"Wiese to Finch, 1 run driven on the up to the cover sweeper...South Africa able to spread the field now"
42,"Wiese to Smith, no run goes across his stumps, you can see all three behind him, whips this to midwicket"
43,"Wiese to Smith, no run outside off, pushed into the covers...that's a good over from Wiese to calm things down a touch"
44,"Tahir to Finch, OUT would you believe it! Starts with a filthy full toss outside off which Finch plants straight to deep midwicket. The mood is with Tahir in recent weeks"
45,"Tahir to Maxwell, no run is that a chance?! A lovely delivery, grips from middle and leg, spins to take the edge and, yes, that is a drop by de Kock behind the stumps"
46,"Tahir to Maxwell, 1 run fuller, shovelled into the leg side towards midwicket where, with a clean piece of fielding, it could have been tight"
47,"Tahir to Smith, no run uses his feet, comes down outside off stump and flicks to midwicket"
48,"Tahir to Smith, no run short outside off, opens the face and guides to point which is well protected"
49,"Tahir to Smith, no run full at middle, pushed back down the pitch where Tahir fields to finish a terrific opening over"
50,"Wiese to Maxwell, FOUR runs that's wonderful batting, it was a short delivery outside off stump but the timing and placement was top class from Maxwell as he goes onto his toes and opens the face through backward point"
51,"Wiese to Maxwell, 1 run tighter to the body, flicked through square leg"
52,"Wiese to Smith, 1 run a slower ball, full outside off, steered down to third man"
53,"Wiese to Maxwell, 1 run taken from outside off into the leg side towards long on"
54,"Wiese to Smith, no run back of a length, outside off, Smith well across his crease and pushes it back to Wiese"
55,"Wiese to Smith, no run more good stuff from Wiese, just outside off, not much width, Smith punches it square to point"
56,"Tahir to Maxwell, 1 run clips a low full toss along the ground to long on"
57,"Tahir to Smith, 1 run some swift footwork from Smith as he flicks it along the ground through midwicket"
58,"Tahir to Maxwell, 2 byes has a mighty swipe at this delivery outside off, doesn't make contact and it beats de Kock to escape for byes towards third man"
59,"Tahir to Maxwell, 1 run nudged into the leg side, plenty of space at midwicket and Tahir chases it himself"
60,"Tahir to Smith, 1 run pushed down the ground to long on"
61,"Tahir to Maxwell, FOUR runs dragged down a touch short, he rocks back and pulls strong to bisect deep midwicket and long on"
62,"Wiese to Smith, no run drives and misses at a full ball outside off, Smith struggling to get going at the moment"
63,"Wiese to Smith, no run terrific bowling, spearing in full at the stumps, Smith falls across as he tries to work it away and gets a thick inside edge into his pads"
64,"Wiese to Smith, no run the frustration growing for Smith as he has a wild heave to a full delivery outside off and almost swings himself off his feet"
65,"Wiese to Smith, 2 runs holds his shape this time, flicks it from well outside off through midwicket and places it nicely for a brace"
66,"Wiese to Smith, OUT and he's edged it! A very tame dismissal. A short delivery which he was trying to guide to third man - another cutter from Wiese, dragged a long way down - and it takes a top edge through to de Kock"
67,"Wiese to Marsh, 1 run short and pulled through midwicket"
68,"Morris to Marsh, 1 run full at the stumps, driven straight and this strikes the umpire on his thigh as he tries to get out of the way"
69,"Morris to Maxwell, FOUR runs poor delivery, angled onto leg stump and that's neatly tickled away to fine leg"
70,"Morris to Maxwell, OUT huge wicket! Short of a length works again. Maxwell standing on leg stump, tries to give himself room to go over the off side but ends up carving high into the air and du Plessis snaffles the catch just outside the fielding circle"
71,"Morris to Marsh, no run full at the stumps, driven into his boot and it bobbles to the off side...almost a mix-up in the running and Marsh has to turn then dives back as Morris collects in his follow through"
72,"Morris to Marsh, 1 run short on leg stump, pulled down to long leg"
73,"Morris to Nevill, no run drives and finds backward point as the pressure increases on Australia"

75,"Wiese to Marsh, no run fuller this time, aims to work into the leg side but gets an inside edge into his boot"
76,"Wiese to Marsh, 1 run shorter this time, another cutter I think, pulled firmly through the leg side but deep midwicket keeps it to a single"
77,"Wiese to Nevill, 1 run length ball outside off, 133kph, he opens the face and backward point can't quite cut it off with a dive"
78,"Wiese to Marsh, 1 run digs out a yorker down the ground to long on"
79,"Wiese to Nevill, 1 run full and straight, the bottom hand comes into play as he finds long on"
80,"Tahir to Nevill, 2 runs flicked through the leg side and nicely placed between deep square and deep midwicket"
81,"Tahir to Nevill, OUT and he has another! Nevill going right back in his crease, the ball appeared to strike in line with leg stump. Will be interesting to see a replay of that one. A typically full-throated appeal from Tahir and to his delight the finger goes up"
82,"Tahir to Hastings, no run beaten with a googly and there's a stumping appeal! Lovely piece of bowling, Hastings completely defeated, didn't pick it at all, and swift glovework from de Kock to get the bails off. It's gone upstairs. He has dragged his foot out, is it still in the air over the line? This is very tight. We've gone to stumpcam now. Millimetres (or"
83,"Tahir to Hastings, FOUR runs drifts onto leg stump and Hastings flicks it away very fine for a welcome boundary"
84,"Tahir to Hastings, no run shorter this time, goes onto the back foot, comes off the surface very slowly and fiddled to the leg side"
85,"Tahir to Hastings, 1 run nearly a return catch! Driven to the off side of the pitch and Tahir flings himself to his left. Would have been spectacular"
86,"Morris to Marsh, 1 run forced into the leg side, they thought of a second but deep midwicket quickly in"
87,"Morris to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye short again, angled into leg stump, not much pace to work with off the pitch as he tries to pull"
88,"Morris to Marsh, SIX runs manages to connect cleanly this time, gets underneath the short delivery this time and is able to get the elevation to clear deep square leg with a pull"
89,"Morris to Marsh, 1 run goes to a fuller length, at the stumps, clubbed down the ground"
90,"Morris to Coulter-Nile, no run back of a length, jars the splice as Coulter-Nile goes for the pull and can only find midwicket"
91,"Morris to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs that's big! Onto the roof at deep midwicket and that ball is staying up there. A slower short delivery which he picked nearly and clubbed mightily over the leg-side boundary"
92,"Abbott to Marsh, 1 run full and straight, driven into the off side"
93,"Abbott to Coulter-Nile, 1 run back of a length, he swings to the leg side and gets a bottom edge past the stumps then a throw at the stumps - when the batsman was perfectly safe - ricochets away for a single"
94,"Abbott to Marsh, FOUR runs short, angled into the leg stump, a slower ball and pulled away wide of short fine leg...not a great delivery"
95,"Abbott to Marsh, SIX runs and a full toss outside off is launched high and wide of long on...that's some power from Marsh who gave himself a solid base to strike through the line"
96,"Abbott to Marsh, 2 runs gets it on target this time, full at leg stump, driven down the ground and a fumble at long on allows them back for a second"
97,"Abbott to Marsh, no run full and very wide, would have been a wide if he hadn't chased it, gets a bottom edge towards the keeper"
98,"Rabada to Hastings, 1 run flicked out to deep midwicket"
99,"Rabada to Marsh, 1 run full and straight, dug out down the ground"
100,"Rabada to Hastings, no run back of a length, tight to the batsman who can only push to the off side"
101,"Rabada to Hastings, 1 run a yorker, excellent from Rabada, jabbed off the toe end into the covers"
102,"Rabada to Marsh, 1 run back-of-a-length slower ball outside off, dabbed towards backward point"
103,"Rabada to Hastings, no run another slower ball, 109kph, dragged down short and Hastings is through his shot before the ball arrives"
104,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run pushed away from around leg stump into the covers"
105,"Tahir to Hastings, OUT that was on the cards...a massive heave at another googly, could have driven a bus between the gap Hastings left as he swung, and the stumps are demolished"
106,"Tahir to Coulter-Nile, no run playing off the back foot, got to be careful, this skids on and he defends to mid-on"
107,"Tahir to Coulter-Nile, 1 run that's a legspinner outside off, cut towards backward point"
108,"Tahir to Marsh, 2 runs full outside off, driven through the covers and there risk a second to the sweeper...if Tahir had taken that at the stumps it could have been close"

113,"Rabada to Coulter-Nile, OUT terrific bowling, that's the model of a leg-stump yorker...NCN gives himself some room, can't make contact and Rabada is right on target"
114,"Rabada to Zampa, 1 wide gets a bouncer first up, 147kph, he ducks and it's called wide so a bonus delivery"
115,"Rabada to Zampa, 2 runs back of a length at off stump, very nicely played through point as he opens the face and uses Rabada's pace"
116,"Rabada to Zampa, no run gives himself a touch of room outside leg then misses his swing at a length delivery outside off"
117,"Abbott to Marsh, no run width outside off, again it might have been a wide, a bottom edge scuttles through to de Kock"
118,"Abbott to Marsh, 2 runs low full toss which he lofts straight down the ground, splits long off and long on"
119,"Abbott to Marsh, OUT short outside off, another cutter, and it gets flat-batted straight to long off where Miller takes the simple catch"
120,"Abbott to Zampa, no run just shaves past off stump as Abbott goes full and Zampa misses"
121,"Abbott to Zampa, no run beaten again, this time the full delivery tails in and goes between Zampa's leg stump and his pads"
122,"Abbott to Zampa, 3 runs full and wide outside off, squeeze away through backward point and Wiese just manages to cut off the boundary"
123,"That's a very fine finish from South Africa. No boundaries in the last two overs. After the start Australia had the home side have done superbly to keep them to 157 for 9. Tahir and Wiese outstanding, well-supported by Rabada and Abbott. Maybe we'll skip over Duminy's over. Finch and Warner were going well, but the middle order struggled except for Mitchell Marsh at"
124,"Howdy, folks. Well, that was a Big Dipper effort from Australia, zooming through a loop-the-loop and then hurtling back to earth, before a little kick at the end and then a juddering halt. It looks like a below-par score... But will South Africa have the measure of chasing once again? We're about to find out"
125,"Nathan Coulter-Nile, playing only his second game since December, with the new ball, AB de Villiers on strike"
126,"Coulter-Nile to du Plessis, 2 runs scooped in the air, but wide of square leg! Short ball and he didn't deal with it very well, shovelled past the diving fielder"

128,"Coulter-Nile to de Kock, 1 run back of a length, de Kock dabs his first ball down into the leg side and calls for a sharp single... would have been tight if Zampa collected cleanly running in from midwicket"

132,"Hastings to de Kock, no run good length, in the channel and again de Kock reaches for it, half an appeal for caught behind but nothing doing"
133,"Hastings to de Kock, no run shortish, on the body, nudged to leg"
134,"Hastings to de Kock, 2 runs swings to leg, across the line and gets a big top edge... that sails over the slips and ends up bouncing towards the rope, third man coming across to prevent four"

141,"Coulter-Nile to du Plessis, 2 runs short ball, again du Plessis swipes it off his hip, a short-arm jab and deep backward square leg does exceptionally well on the boundary to keep them to two"
