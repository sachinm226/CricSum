7,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run on the pads again, nurdled down to fine leg"
8,"Hardik to Finch, OUT mis-timed and gone. Australia's man in touch is gone. A full delivery outside off from Pandya, Finch tries to go over mid-off, the right ball to hit, but can only skew the ball off the outside half towards Bumrah at mid-off, who rusn to his left, takes the catch, but the ball pops out. The ball is rolling all over his legs like an insect, but Bumrah uses his feel, not his sight, to hold on somehow."

18,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run extremely full and wide, Warner reaches out and guides to deep point"
19,"Jadhav to Smith, 1 run a high full toss on middle and leg, whacked away to deep midwicket. Should have been put in the stands, but Smith doesn't take the bait just yet. Might have just been intentional, you kow"

58,"Jadhav to Smith, OUT gone! Jadhav does it again! A dangerous, dangerous shot, sweeping from the stumps - because of Jadhav's low arm, the ball follows a stump-to-stump trajectory right from the time it leaves his hand, when he's bowling from over the stumps. It's fairly flat, and it doesn't give him too much time to get down on one knee, and he's in a half-crouch when he swipes at it and misses, and he's struck absolute"
59,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run tossed up slow, just outside off, driven to long-off"
60,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run shortish, angling in from wide of the crease, chopped away to deep point"

63,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, no run a bit fuller, blocked back to the bowler"
64,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, 1 run a bit more air on it, a touch wider of off stump, driven to long-off"

69,"Jadhav to Warner, no run nice length, angling in towards off stump, driven into the point region"
70,"Jadhav to Warner, no run back of a length, flat, angling into off stump and cramping Warner. Wants to flat-bat to long-off, maybe, and ends up hitting it back to the bowler"
71,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run a bit of width, slapped to deep point"
72,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs slow flight outside off, gets down low to sweep it through backward square leg"

74,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, no turn, punched to long-off"
75,"Axar Patel to Warner, OUT down the track, and Warner's chipped this straight to long-on! Soft dismissal, but maybe he wanted to hit it a lot wider, looking to whip it in the air from outside off stump. The lack of turn may have forced him to hit it straighter, and long-on takes a nice catch running to his left"
76,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, 1 run back of a length, angling into middle stump, punched to long-on"
77,"Axar Patel to Head, no run shortish outside off, but not too much width. Cut to backward point"

82,"Jadhav to Head, 1 run shortish outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
83,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs floated up just outside off. Read the line well, Handscomb, stretched out and got his head over the ball to lap-sweep fine, just to the left of the keeper"

85,"Jadhav to Head, no run full on off stump, defended to extra-cover"
86,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, no run nice length, angling into off stump. Looks to drive to long-on and gets a leading-edge that loops to the left of that catcher at short extra"
87,"Axar Patel to Handscomb, OUT oh no. Another batsman falls to the sweep. This time it's extra bounce rather than lack of bounce, and Handscomb gets a top-edge that flies high behind the wicket. Rahane runs back from slip and judges it perfectly. This was flat, just outside off, and pitched shorter than Handscomb expected"
88,"Axar Patel to Head, no run length ball on off stump, clipped to short, straight midwicket"
89,"Axar Patel to Head, 1 run full, just outside off, driven to long-on"

95,"Jadhav to Head, FOUR runs for once, Jadhav drops one in the slot for a big drive. Actually, Head made the length by stepping out of his crease, and drove powerfully past the bowler"
96,"Jadhav to Head, no run tossed up a bit wider, driven to extra-cover"
97,"Jadhav to Head, no run slow, on a good length outside off, defended into the covers"
98,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run slows it up outside off, and Stoinis, shaping for the paddle-sweep, is too early into his shot, is hit on the pad"
99,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 1 run full outside off, driven to long-off"
100,"Axar Patel to Head, no run length ball on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
101,"Axar Patel to Head, 1 run back of a length on off and middle, whipped to deep square leg"
102,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, FOUR runs ooh, some dip and turn there, and Stoinis bisects keeper and slip. Stretched forward to defend, wasn't near the pitch of it - Axar had slowed it up considerably - and the outside edge finds the gap perfectly"

104,"Jadhav to Head, no run full outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
105,"Jadhav to Head, no run back of a length, angling into off stump, makes room and slaps to cover - the sweeper's been brought in to the edge of the circle now"

107,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run tossed up on middle stump, clipped to long-on"

111,"Axar Patel to Head, no run back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to play that to short midwicket"
112,"Axar Patel to Head, FOUR runs tossed up fuller now, outside off, and Head drives between cover and extra-cover. Nice stride forward and a whip of the wrists to give it impetus"
113,"Axar Patel to Head, no run back of a length, just outside off, defended to short extra-cover"
114,"Axar Patel to Head, no run down the track now, whips this from off stump to the man at square midwicket"
115,"Axar Patel to Head, no run a bit of extra bounce. Looks to sweep this length ball turning in towards off stump, and the ball jumps and hits him on the hip"
116,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run length ball turning down leg, Stoinis misses the sweep. Big appeal for caught behind, not given. Not called wide either. Maybe a tickle of pad?"
117,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run length ball on the pads, clipped through square leg"
118,"Jadhav to Head, no run fullish, angling into off stump. Looks for the drive to long-off. Kohli intercepts with a dive to his left from short extra"

122,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run slow length ball wide of off stump, Stoinis looks to sweep, misses"
123,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 2 runs flat length ball that spins away from off stump. Stoinis is only half-forward in defence, and the thick outside edge runs away to the right of slip"
124,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run flat length ball, this one goes with the angle. Again he's only half forward in defence and gets an inside-edge into his pad"
125,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run back of a length, another slider, defended from the crease towards midwicket"
126,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
127,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, FOUR runs and again! Why is slip so wide? Length ball spins away from off stump, and again Stoinis is nowhere near the pitch while propping forward to defend. The outside edge beats Dhoni to his right, and slip is nowhere near it"
128,"Jadhav to Head, FOUR runs angles this down the leg side, and Head capitalises, gets down quickly to sweep it nice and fine - short fine leg is rather square"
129,"Jadhav to Head, 1 run down the track now, doesn't quite reach the pitch of this flat one outside off. Swings hard and hits it down to long-on, along the ground, off the inside half of the bat"
130,"Jadhav to Stoinis, SIX runs down the track, and he's just cleared the leaping long-on fielder. Gets into a great position for the lofted drive, and hit it straight, so long-on had quite a distance to move to his left. Went a fair way over his head too"
131,"Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length outside off, slapped into the covers"
132,"Jadhav to Head, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
133,"Jadhav to Stoinis, no run back of a length outside off, stops on him and keeps low. Wanted to slap that through the covers, ends up flat-batting it back to the bowler"
134,"Axar Patel to Head, 1 run flat, angling into the pads, clipped to long leg"
135,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 2 runs Stoinis was in position to sweep even before Axar released. Sends one down slightly shorter outside off, and the batsman adjusts, plays a controlled half-pull off one knee, through square leg"

137,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, no run length ball on off stump, flat, defended to short extra"

139,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 1 run short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
140,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 leg bye the stock ball, flighted, turns sharply from middle and leg to outside leg. Looks to come forward and work it leg side, the ball beats inside edge and rolls into the short fine leg region off pad"
141,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run shortish, goes back to flat-bat to long-off"
142,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run length ball turning in towards middle and leg, goes forward to clip into the backward square leg region"
143,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run down the track, meets the flighted ball on a middle-stump line and drags a drive down to long-on, past the bowler's right hand. He was a little slow bending down"
144,"Kuldeep to Head, no run excellent length. Draws Head forward with flight, and beats him with dip and sharp turn. Head's hands followed the ball, looking to jab through cover point"
145,"Kuldeep to Head, no run tossed up outside off, sharp turn again, and he misses the sweep. Or has he? Big appeal from Dhoni, and India have reviewed umpire Nandan's not-out decision. Was there a bottom edge? Ultra-edge says no."
146,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length, angling into off stump, lets it come on and tucks it into the midwicket region"

150,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run back of a length outside off, a little wider than the previous ball, left alone"
151,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run full on off stump, driven firmly down the ground and Pandey stops it with a dive to his right from mid-on"
152,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run down the track and Kuldeep slows it down considerably. Finds himself nowhere near the pitch of it as it turns down leg, and he sticks out his leg to pad it away"
153,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run flatter, back of a length, tucked away through backward square leg"
154,"Kuldeep to Head, no run tossed up slow and wide of off. Goes for the big flat-bat drive and he's beaten by turn and bounce. Dhoni takes it over his shoulder, and falls backwards but still clings on"

156,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run tossed up on off stump, driven to long-off"

167,"Kuldeep to Head, no run overpitched and straight, flicked to midwicket. The line is straight"

175,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 2 runs how did that not hit the stumps? Short and straight, the ball skids on, takes the inside edge and somehow misses the stumps. Two down to fine leg"
176,"Kuldeep to Head, 2 runs short and wide again, too much width, Head rocks back and crashes a cut past cover for a couple"
177,"Kuldeep to Head, FOUR runs hammered! Gets low, premeditates the slog sweep, stays low and executes, over midwicket. Just in front of the boundary"
178,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run short and wide again, slapped to long-off for one"
179,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run just short of Axar, who did not go for the catch. A googly on middle, Stoinis comes down and outside-edges the variation towards short third man. Well bowled, shortened the length"
180,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run flight outside off, driven back to the bowler"
181,"Axar Patel to Head, no run that's close! Head dances down the track and misses the flick, struck him just outside the line maybe"

186,"Axar Patel to Stoinis, 1 run flat down leg, clipped to square leg"

188,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run the googly outside off, punched to deep point from the back foot. Wanted the conventional sweep, but adjusted well"
189,"Kuldeep to Wade, no run toe-ends the ball back to the bowler. Sweepy Wade gets down immediately, but plays it too early"
190,"Kuldeep to Wade, 1 run short outside off, worked to deep midwicket off the back foot"
191,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run the googly. So much extra bounce because of the revs through the variation, Stoinis watches it onto his cut and finds deep point"
192,"Kuldeep to Wade, 2 runs executed this time. A low full toss is swept fine towards fine leg. Bhuvi picks up and fires at the right end, the bowler's end, but Stoinis makes it in time"
193,"Kuldeep to Wade, no run"
194,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run good length around off, the ball seams back in, pushed back to the bowler"
195,"Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT given by umpire Erasmus. Stoinis reviews again. Umpire's call will decide this. Full on off, the ball has seamed back in prodigiously and struck Stoinis in front of off, beaten by discernible late lateral movement. No bat. Impact is umpire's call so Stoinis has to walk back. Fell over his stroke slightly"

197,"Bumrah to Faulkner, no run full and straight again, pushed away to mid-on. Another dot. Five on the bounce"

202,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run on the pads, bat on ball to square leg. Losing momentum"
203,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, no run a low full toss, Wade drives the ball straight back to Bhuvneshwar. Pressure building"
204,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, no run full and very wide outside off, 123 kph, miscued back to the bowler. Another dot. Just 19 runs off the last five overs."
205,"Bumrah to Head, no run fullish length outside off, Head fails to connect with a slap. Bounces in front of Dhoni, who stops the ball with a grimace"

209,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run full and straight, Stoinis plays with an angled bat, and the ball skews back to the bowler"
210,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run full and wide outside off, dabbed to point. Struggling to hit the gaps consistently"
211,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run nails the slog sweep, but finds deep midwicket running to his right. Lots of flight on middle and off, hammered by Head"
212,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs in the gap. Stoinis definitely has the ability to hit the ball, like this. Flight on middle and leg, Stoinis gets low and creams an uppish sweep in the gap at square leg"
213,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run runs down at the bowler, but Kuldeep's googly is shorter, so Stoinis adjusts and keeps it out"
214,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run doesn't quite get to the pitch. Australia probably attacking this last over of the second Powerplay. Stoinis runs down and skews a lofted drive to deep midwicket"
215,"Kuldeep to Head, 1 run short and wide, the stock ball, slashed to the sweeper cover"
216,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs there is no one there. The googly, short and wide, the ball rips and spins away from Stoinis, who goes deep in the crease and slashes it in the gap at extra cover. That's terrific batting, Kuldeep though Stoinis was coming down"
217,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run good length on off, muscled to mid-off for one. Wanted more than one"
218,"Bumrah to Wade, no run 138 kph, looking for the paddle scoop. A yorker on off, Wade toe-ends it back again."
219,"Bumrah to Wade, 1 run full on off, skewed away to deep point for one. The ball moving away late"
220,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run a yorker on leg, nudged to deep midwicket, just the one again."
221,"Bumrah to Wade, 2 runs wow, a lucky two. A slower ball down leg, Wade is too early through his flick, toe-ends it away to deep midwicket. Bumrah chases after it, two easy"
222,"Bumrah to Wade, 1 run another slower delivery to finish, 119 kph, on off, worked to square leg. Just six off that over"
223,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, SIX runs he has hit that well enough. Full and wide outside off, Wade gets underneath the length and gets enough power to clear mid-off. Tried to hit that over cover, but all muscle"
224,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, 1 run good yorker there. On middle and off, jammed back to the bowler who parries it away while diving to his right"
225,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run a low full toss on middle and leg, driven back to Wade, who had to hurry out of the way. Pandya gets across from long-on"
226,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, 2 runs good idea, decent execution. Wanted to hit that over square leg, the slower ball on leg, Wade got that over square leg but not enough power behind it. A couple"
227,"Bhuvneshwar to Wade, 1 run a fine low full toss on off, driven away to long-off, just one. India will be happy with this"
228,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run terrific bowling, another low full toss, driven to long-on. 12 off it, a decent over for Australia"
229,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run full and straight, skewed away to midwicket. Faulkner races back for the second, Wade looks and sends Faulkner back far too late. The throw to the bowler lands in front of Bumrah who allows it go by, allowing Faulkner to run back to make his crease. Sloppy"
230,"Bumrah to Wade, 1 run full and straight, a miscued loft to long-on, on the bounce"
231,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run a wide slower ball outside off, mis-timed to cover for another single."
232,"Bumrah to Wade, 1 run looked like the bat went as far as the ball. Wade runs down, converts the yorker into a low full toss and squeezed that to deep point for one. Bat and ball lands safely"
233,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 run mis-timed badly to long-on. A low full toss again, Faulkner can only bunt it away to long-on. Wade struggling to catch his breath back"
234,"Bumrah to Wade, OUT 135 kph, straight to the sweeper cover. Just five off that. A low full toss outside off, Wade gets underneath that but can only slice it away to the man on the sweeper boundary. Wade tried but that's a slightly under-par cameo"
235,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run dropped by Pandya. A low full toss from Bhuvi, Faulkner smashes it to long-on, where Pandya runs in, but drops it. Couldn't keep up with his momentum"
236,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 1 run good length on off, slapped away to deep midwicket. Pandey is quick on it. Just one"
237,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run full and wide outside off, Faulkner reaches out but can only find the sweeper cover."
238,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 1 run full and straight again, all Cummins can do is drive to long-on, with the direction of swing. Another single"
239,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run, OUT run-out! A 123 kph slower ball wide outside off, Faulkner can only mis-time it to long-on, he wants to retain strike for the final ball, and runs back but was never going to make it. Dhoni collects the ball and removes the bails with Faulkner a foot short"
240,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, OUT misses a full, straight ball. 138 kph, full on off, Coulter-Nile winds up and looks to unfurl a big swing, but fails to connect at all. The off stump is uprooted"
241,"4.57pm Australia have continued to struggle in the end overs. All they could muster is 32 runs off the last six overs, substantially below par, even though this surface is slightly two-paced. It seemed, after the start, that Australia set themselves up for 300 again, but yet again, another absolute struggle towards the end overs. Pace off the ball, cutters, the quicker delivery, that's what Australia need, and hope that it can"
242,"5.40pm Hello again. In these conditions, 243 might not be an entirely straightforward target to chase, but do Australia have an attack that can exploit this slow, low and grippy pitch? Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane are out in the middle now, as are the Australian players. It's Pat Cummins to bowl the first over."
243,"Cummins to Rahane, no run shortish, a bit of inward nip as Rahane looks to defend, ends up playing slightly outside the line. Appeal for lbw, but that definitely struck him too high, on the left thigh pad"
244,"Cummins to Rahane, no run length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
245,"Cummins to Rahane, FOUR runs length ball on middle stump, and that's beautifully played. Just leaned forward, let the ball arrive under his eyes, and met it with a straight bat, turning his wrists at the moment of contact to send it running away to the left of square leg"

251,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, 1 run shortish, fourth-stump line, lets it come on and opens his bat face to dab it down to third man"
252,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run good ball. Back of a length, fifth-stump line, just a bit of late shape away. Rohit hangs his bat away from his body, neither defending nor attacking, and is beaten by the movement"
253,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length on off stump, defended back towards the bowler. Straightened again, and squared up the batsman slightly"
254,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, angling into middle and off, clipped to square leg"
255,"Cummins to Rahane, FOUR runs fullish, close to off stump, and Rahane is a little early into his straight drive, checks his shot slightly, but times it so well that it races away unstoppably between non-striker and umpire"
256,"Cummins to Rahane, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line. Looks for that single to third man again, and Smith dives left from backward point to deny him. We saw a lot of this in Bengaluru too"

259,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"

261,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run length ball angling into off stump, clipped to mid-on"
262,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, 1 run length ball on off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on. Doesn't put as much weight on the shot as with the previous ball, and as a result he gets an easy single"

264,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run a bit of extra bounce and some inward movement towards off and middle. Looks to clip into the leg side and the ball hits him on the thigh pad"
265,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, fifth-stump line, opens his bat face for a push to backward point"
266,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run good ball. Angled in towards off stump, and it straightens just a bit. Rohit was looking to play it with the angle, into the leg side, and had to adjust late to play it towards the bowler off the outside half of his bat"
267,"Cummins to Rahane, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"

270,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run all those dot balls, and Rohit goes for a big hit. Back of a length, angling into off stump. Swings at it, looking to hit over mid-on, and inside-edges into his pad. Loops up in the air, and fortunately for the batsman drops short of Cummins's stretch"
271,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs and now he's off the mark. Overpitched, for once, angling into off stump, and all he has to do is meet it with the full face and drive back past the bowler, to the right of mid-off"
272,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs two in two. Not overpitched like the previous one, but full nonetheless, and he extends his arms through another drive to hit over the top, to the right of mid-off"
273,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run length ball, fourth-stump line. Stretches forward and across to clip to midwicket"

289,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs slower ball, full and fairly wide outside off. Maybe wanted to bait him into an uppish drive, but Rohit got a nice stride in, got his head over the ball, and drove all along the ground, to the right of cover point"

296,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off"

Today, their spinners made far better use of a surface with a lot of help for them, not giving away the freebies that their Australian counterparts doled out. And their chase was brilliantly constructed. Rohit and Rahane had to see out some very good new-ball bowling from Cummin"
