0,1.00pm South Africa won the toss and chose to bat
1,"Tremain to de Kock, no run good start from Tremain. Full, but not overpitched. Slightly wide, drawing de Kock forward. No movement and solidly blocked."
2,"Tremain to de Kock, no run this was overpitched. Pushing it fuller to invite some swing. none in the air, none off the pitch. The result a sweet on-drive back to the bowler"
3,"Tremain to de Kock, 2 runs too straight this time, full and straight. De Kock will pick those off all day, all night. Clipped through the vacant midwicket region. To both these batsmen, the top-of-off line should be more outside off."
4,"Tremain to de Kock, no run 129 kph, full and wide outside off. Rather be here than straight. Driven to mid-off"
5,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run 131.4 kph, full on off. Not a bad line, not a bad length. Yet, de Kock strides forward and shovels to midwicket. Such a strong bottom hand"
6,"Tremain to Amla, no run superb end. 135.6 kph, fullish on off. Amla stays in his crease and defends with head over ball"
7,"Boland to de Kock, 1 run superb run. 131.7 kph, nagging line on off. De Kock plays it with soft hands, by his feet. Calls Amla through, who responds positive. An easy single. Real quality that"
8,"Boland to Amla, no run hmm, 132 kph. Good length outside off, Amla goes back to try and punch through cover. He mis-times to mid-on. Early signs of a slow surface? Amla rarely mis-hits"
9,"Boland to Amla, no run no, cannot be there. Poor delivery, short and wide outside off. Amla goes back, late transfer of weight onto the back foot but misses his cut."
10,"Boland to Amla, no run better, 132 kph. Good length on off, may have come back in slightly. Worked to square leg, using those wrists"
11,"Boland to Amla, FOUR runs delectable. This one is timed to perfection. A very similar delivery to the second one, shortish and wide. Amla stays back, all his wight on the back foot and just times his square cut through point."
12,"Boland to Amla, no run good comeback. gets it straighter, towards off on a good length. Amla takes his bottom hand off as he defends, some extra bounce"
13,"Tremain to de Kock, 3 runs too straight again, easily worked past mid-on. Finch hurtles back from mid-on and puts i a boundary-saving dive. Nice work from Finch. Cannot bowl there though. Just easy for Qdk"
14,"Tremain to Amla, no run oh my. What a shot. 129 kph, overpitched on off. Crisply driven to mid-off with the full face of the bat"
15,"Tremain to Amla, FOUR runs there goes with the inconsistency. Amla waits for the straight delivery, gets it and then whips it off through midwicket with an ease only he can procure. Races away, quick outfield"
16,"Tremain to Amla, 1 run good length on off, not a bad ball but Amla manufactures a run by working it through square leg."
17,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run tapped into the leg side, an apparent plan to keep it straight but I disagree with this process. These two too strong on the pads"
18,"Tremain to Amla, no run too wide outside off this time, not great bowling. A half-volley outside off is pummelled to cover. Lucky to get away with that"
19,"Boland to de Kock, 1 run 139 kph, down leg. An easy whip off the pad through deep square leg. Keeping it along the ground, good from de Kock. Played an awful stroke last match, easy to get away with it in the Highveld, not in port Elizabeth or here."
20,"Boland to Amla, FOUR runs superb. Full on a fifth-stump line. Amla shuffles across, waits for it and then slices the ball almost by opening the face discernibly late. Gets the gap at point, gets four. All class"
21,"Boland to Amla, 1 run tip and run. Full, coming back in towards off. Amla plays it through gully for one"
22,"Boland to de Kock, no run fullish on off, pushed into the off side"
23,"Boland to de Kock, no run better I would say. Full on off, a bit of late away movement. Still, de Kock tries to work it through midwicket but that late swing is responsible for a skew to mid-off"
24,"Boland to de Kock, no run an appeal is quickly withdrawn. Good length on middle and leg. pitched outside leg. De Kock misses a routine flick"
25,"Tremain to Amla, FOUR runs a half-volley. Australia's inexperienced seamers are showing it. Simple for a class batsman to just caress his drive through cover. Tear-your-hair out bowling."
26,"Tremain to Amla, 1 run still the inexperience showing. Not a bad ball to most batsmen, but it is to Amla, who shuffles across and whips a length delivery on off and middle through square leg"
27,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run better. Closer to off, on a good length. Worked to fine leg, playing it well de Kock."
28,"Tremain to Amla, no run okay, can't do much about that. Acceptable. Good length slightly outside off, a nice line to Amla. Sweetly-timed to mid-off"
29,"Tremain to Amla, 1 run not a bad change-up. The 127 bouncer on off is too slow to trouble Amla, who has enough time to use his technique to get on top of the bounce and rolls his wrists to find one to deep square leg"
30,"Tremain to de Kock, 1 run another single through square leg. 127 kph. Nice lines to finish"
31,"Boland to de Kock, 1 run yet again, so easy for de Kock. Just nudge a leg side delivery through square leg to get one"
32,"Boland to Amla, FOUR runs 135 kph, this is not good bowling. Not good at all. Half-volley outside off, Amla opens the face and times his drive through extra cover."
33,"Boland to Amla, 1 run much better. Full on off and middle, Amla bunts the ball through mid-off for an atypically quick run"
34,"Boland to de Kock, no run ah, a dot ball to de Kock. Why? Because it's fullish and wide outside off. Better line to de Kock, driven to mid-off"
35,"Boland to de Kock, no run good length on off, de Kock works to short fine leg. An ODI stroke"
36,"Boland to de Kock, OUT gone! Exactly where Australia should have been bowling from the start. Pushes it slightly wider, a full length on a fourth/fifth-stump line. De Kock's intention is to score and so pushes at it with hard hands. All he succeeds in doing is chipping a catch to short cover, brought there due to the lack of swing. Against the run of play"
37,"Mennie to Amla, no run nice. 135 kph, full and straight. Nudged towards square leg"
38,"Mennie to Amla, no run a big appeal, 130 kph. Thigh pad says the umpire. Good length down leg, Amla walks off and misses a simple nudge. He wouldn't normally miss those"
39,"Mennie to Amla, no run 130.6 kph, good length on off and middle. Blocked"
40,"Mennie to Amla, OUT big, big wicket. Mennie goes through Amla and the stumps are sent cartwheeling. What a beauty. Not sure Amla could do anything about that. Mennie goes wide of the crease, pitches this on off and middle. like most deliveries today, Amla thinks this is coming back in. but it pitches and straightens and beats Amla's flick to clatter into off stump. To beat a batsman like Amla with a bit of swing, that's a specia"
41,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run good length on off, solid in defense. Head over the ball"
42,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run 132 kph, fullish on off. Nice lines. Pushed to cover. Wicket maiden. Sensational over."
43,"Boland to du Plessis, no run suddenly, the lines are impeccable. Good length outside off, the ball comes back in. Du Plessis leaves, a tight leave"
44,"Boland to du Plessis, FOUR runs oh yeah. Superb. Slightly overpitched on middle and leg, easy enough to present the full face of the bat and use his bottom hand to get it past mid-on. Races away."
45,"Boland to Rossouw, no run good length outside off, not much swing. Rossouw thinks pf playing it, but withdraws late"
46,"Boland to Rossouw, no run 132 kph, fullish on off, solidly kept out"
47,"Boland to Rossouw, no run overpitched outside off, 134 kph, sweetly driven to cover. Can't find the gap"
48,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run good length outside off, 129 kph. Dabbed down to point. Nice lines, Mennie has been spot on"
49,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run oh beaut! Good length outside off, the ball moves away and beats the bat. Faf is left hanging his bat out"
50,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run 135 kph, overpitched on off. Driven to mid-off. It's not wide so it's not a bad delivery"
51,"Mennie to du Plessis, 1 run good length outside of, opens the face of his bat and angles this down to third man. Nice."
52,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run 127 kph, quite close to off. Pushed to mid-on. Not extracting a lot of movement, the lines are good enough to keep the batsmen circumspect"
53,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs nope, that was overpitched. Too full on off, a simple opportunity for Rossouw to on-drive past mid-on. Superlative timing"
54,"Boland to du Plessis, FOUR runs another on-drive. 132 kph, great shot. Just too full, too straight. Faf punches his straight drive, again, the bottom hand gets it past his partner and for four"
55,"Boland to du Plessis, no run good length outside off, blocked into the off side"
56,"Boland to du Plessis, no run 134 kph, good lines. Closer to outside off and full. Faf tries to force his drive, opened up his stance a touch. Into the ground and to short cover"
57,"Boland to du Plessis, 1 run good length outside off, 132 kph. Steered down to third man"
58,"Boland to Rossouw, no run 135 kph, good length on off. Rossouw runs down and hits it back to the bowler"
59,"Boland to Rossouw, no run nicely played. Good length outside off, 133 kph. Hit on the up to extra cover"
60,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run 129 kph, good length on middle. Pushed down to mid-on. Better line"
61,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run 131 kph, good length on off. Dabbed down to backward point. Nagging away are these Aus bowlers now"
62,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run shortish outside off, 129 kph. Brings it back in. Slapped to cover, improperly timed"
63,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run 133 kph, overpitched on off. Yorker almost. Jammed out to mid-on"
64,"Mennie to du Plessis, no run 132 kph, good length outside off, patted into the off side. Really good bowling now. Not giving away much"
65,"Mennie to du Plessis, OUT another one! Faf troubled with some nagging lines attempts an exuberant lofted drive, but the ball pitches on off and moves back in. Not prodigious but enough and beats Faf's inside edge and take the top of off and middle. Faf undone by pressure and the movement, both equally responsible for the wicket"
66,"Boland to Rossouw, FOUR runs ooh, mis-field. Very un-Australian. Full and wide outside off, too much width. Rossouw thrashes his drive straight to extra cover who lets it go through. Trav Head"
67,"Boland to Rossouw, no run good comeback. Good length outside off, tapped towards backward point"
68,"Boland to Rossouw, no run 134 kph, overpitched outside off. Driven to mid-off"

72,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs overpitched from Mennie. From around the wicket, bowls it full outside off. Rossouw strides forward and hits his cover drive into the ground, whistles away over cover"
73,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run walks across to clip through square leg. The fielder sprints to his left to cut it off"
74,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs oh my. Another sensational stroke. Too full on off, Rossouw stays forward, gets the length and then just presens the full face to time his drive through mid-off. Beautiful"
75,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run good length on off, pushed away towards mid-on"
76,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run good length outside off, quietly played into the off side"
77,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run looking to hit that too hard. 121 kph, slower delivery outside off. Rossouw wanted to muscle that past mid-on but skewed his stroke to mid-on from the inside half of his bat"
78,"Marsh to Duminy, FOUR runs oh yes. Another superb drive. Marsh starts it with a freebie, full and wide outside off. Duminy laces his cover drive past extra cover. Too much width, too full. Just easy, even for a batsman playing his first ball"

100,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run firm drive but straight to the skipper at extra cover"
101,"Marsh to Rossouw, SIX runs clears his front leg and hammers that into the wide long-on boundary. That isn't to say it was a slog. It was a shimmy down the pitch, didn't get to the pitch alright, but he still went through with the bat to muscle that over the ropes. Top hit"

113,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run drilled down the ground to long-off"
114,"Marsh to Duminy, 2 runs check drive but boy, he's hit it superbly. Into the gap at deep extra cover. Not sure why he was apprehensive. The ball may have held up just a little, but he adjusted well. Good timing, better placement"

203,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run good length outside off, slapped to deep cover. Timing is superlative. Cracked that straight to the fielder"
204,"Marsh to Duminy, no run full and straight, 133 kph. Nudged away towards midwicket"
205,"Marsh to Duminy, 1 run good length outside off, chopped down to third man with the angled bat"
206,"Marsh to Rossouw, FOUR runs pulled to the long-off boundary. This is how much modern batting has improved. Shortish length outside off, Rossouw shimmied down looking to go over midwicket. Wasn't close to playing that shot, so he drilled it down to long-off with unbelievable timing"
207,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run good length on middle and leg, kept out"
208,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run 128 kph, good length outside off. Pushed to cover"
209,"Tremain to Duminy, FOUR runs superb batting from JP. Gets an offcutter on middle and leg, JP rushes down, meets the ball and lofts it over mid-on with nonchalant ease."
210,"Tremain to Duminy, FOUR runs oh my. Things are going from worse to unbearable. Full outside off, driven straight to mid-off. Duminy calls for one immediately. Mennie is quick to the ball, but lifts his eyes while collecting and the ball goes straight through. And to the boundary. Raucous, sarcastic cheers."
211,"Tremain to Duminy, 1 run bouncer on off and middle, pulled towards square leg"
212,"Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs well run, good length down leg, nudged towards backward square. Played that with soft hands, enabling them to get back for two"
213,"Tremain to Rossouw, 1 run 137 kph, fullish outside off. Driven down to long-off"
214,"Tremain to Duminy, no run short delivery, another bouncer. Duminy gets under that. Another superb over for SA"
215,"Marsh to Rossouw, FOUR runs picked the length early, gets it and latches onto the short delivery. Drops short at medium pace, Rossouw pulls it emphatically, played it early to get it in front of square. Marsh has been awful today"
216,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run full on off, driven to long-off"
217,"Marsh to Duminy, 1 run good length outside off, steered down to third man. Very nice from JP"
218,"Marsh to Rossouw, no run bouncer on off, Rossouw gets underneath that. Good change-up from Marsh"
219,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run short and wide outside off, more tripe. Scythed to deep cover."
220,"Marsh to Duminy, 1 run shortish on off, 135 kph. Pulled to deep square leg, rolled his wrists on that to keep it down"
221,"Mennie to Duminy, 4 leg byes good length down leg, Duminy misses his flick but the ball pings off the pad and ricochets away for four leg byes"
222,"Mennie to Duminy, no run full outside off, pushed to cover"
223,"Mennie to Duminy, 1 run overpitched on middle, beautifully driven to long-on. Straight face"
224,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run good length on middle, blocked"
225,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run full on middle and off, Rossouw opens his stance slightly and drives to long-off. One closer"
226,"Mennie to Duminy, 1 run good length outside off, 130 kph. Dabbed down to third man"
227,"Boland to Duminy, 1 run short and wide outside off, 137 kph. Played away to deep point."

229,"Boland to Rossouw, no run short and wide outside off, hit on the up but straight to cover"
230,"Boland to Rossouw, 1 run nudged towards short fine leg, slowish delivery down leg"
231,"Boland to Duminy, 1 wide wide called. Bouncer on off, Duminy sways out of the line. A tad too high feels the square leg umpire"
232,"Boland to Duminy, no run slow on middle, worked into the leg side"
233,"Boland to Duminy, no run another cutter on off, pushed away towards cover"
234,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run 131 kph, full outside off, crisply driven to long-off to move to 99"
235,"Mennie to Duminy, OUT out! Soft dismissal. Duminy falls. A rather selfless stroke. Full and wide outside off, Duminy wanted to open the face to drive towards deep cover in order to get Rossouw back on strike. Instead, carves a ball to backward point because the ball is too wide to fetch and hit that much in front of square. Quality, quality knock from JP. Hardly mis-hit a ball"
236,"Mennie to Miller, 1 run shortish delivery down leg, nudged down to fine leg. Attacking those ribs, Miller upto it"
237,"Mennie to Rossouw, no run well bowled, 130 kph. Bouncer on off, Rossouw sways out of the line. Well played too, a good ball is allowed to be kept out"
238,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run gets it this time. Fist-pumping his way to the other end. Delight, joy, exhilaration. Another quality innings from Rossouw. A short delivery is pulled to deep square leg to get to his 3rd ODI ton, a serious knock this. And under pressure too. Complete transfer of momentum"
239,"Mennie to Miller, no run good length outside off, played down to point"
240,"Boland to Rossouw, FOUR runs slapped for four. Easy for Rossouw. He shimmies down, a natural improvisation from the bowler to drop short and Rossouw pummels his slap past mid-off. Great batting"
241,"Boland to Rossouw, no run advances again, Boland goes short again but with more fury and annoyance. Forces Rossouw out of the stroke"
242,"Boland to Rossouw, 2 runs slower delivery outside off, dabbed down to third man from the crease."
243,"Boland to Rossouw, no run wild swing. Rossouw still has an important role here. Lots of overs still. Short outside off, Rossouw comes down and swings, but misses"
244,"Boland to Rossouw, FOUR runs that deserved to go, good shot selection too. Short down leg, sits up for Rossouw to pull to the deep square leg boundary. Head gets across but can't pull it in"
245,"Boland to Rossouw, no run shimmies down again, Boland drops short and Rossouw flat-bats his slap to cover"
246,"Mennie to Miller, no run shapes to pull but the ball keeps low to beat him to the stroke and thud into the thigh"
247,"Mennie to Miller, 1 run dabbed wide of point for an easy single"
248,"Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run worked off his hip to midwicket, they chance a risky single and get it"
249,"Mennie to Miller, FOUR runs teaser for third man, but he had no chance on this fast outfield. Deft little touch from Miller. Not known for it, maybe he surprised himself. Superbly done"
250,"Mennie to Miller, 1 run leading edge flies down to third man again. Closed the bat face early and saw the ball get big on him"
251,"Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs backs away and pierces a packed off side field. Short third man and point were in place to prevent the slash, but to no avail as he freed his arms and picked the gap"
252,"Head to Miller, 1 run turned with the angle to deep midwicket"
253,"Head to Rossouw, no run slapped to cover where Smith dives to is right to pull off a one-handed stop"
254,"Head to Rossouw, 2 byes missed the flick, the keeper was blinded too and it runs down towards fine leg"
255,"Head to Rossouw, 1 run punched to deep midwicket"
256,"Head to Miller, 1 run tossed up on middle, worked across the line towards deep midwicket"
257,"Head to Rossouw, 1 run paddles that, but the ball flies off a top-edge, fortunately no one positioned straight behind the wicketkeeper"
258,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run gets a thick inside edge to short fine, it was an attempted biff over deep midwicket"
259,"Marsh to Miller, no run swing and a miss. Floated at length outside off, he stepped out to go inside-out over cover, but played too early. Perhaps gave away his intention quickly too"
260,"Marsh to Miller, 1 run digs one in short, swivels back and helps it down to fine leg"
261,"Marsh to Rossouw, 1 run another wild swing but can only toe-end it down to long-on"
262,"Marsh to Miller, 1 run punches a length ball on the up to sweeper cover"
263,"Marsh to Rossouw, 2 runs bowler floats it full and wide outside off, batsman reaches out to squeeze that behind point"
264,"Head to Miller, 2 runs gets a thick inside edge down to long-on even as he tries to go inside-out over cover, the fielder was caught napping an they scamper back for the second. Smith won't be pleased"
265,"Head to Miller, 1 run steps out and turns it across the line to square leg"
266,"Head to Rossouw, 1 run backs away to steer that one towards deep point"
267,"Head to Miller, FOUR runs uppish but over the top to find the fence in the deep. It was fired full and flat outside off, Rossouw backed away to free his arms and smear that into the gap"
268,"Head to Miller, 1 run steps out, the bowler fires it into the pads, worked to deep square"
269,"Head to Rossouw, no run uppish and straight to the man at the edge of the circle at cover"
270,"Tremain to Miller, 1 run sliced to point, but Bailey can only half-stop that to concede a single"
271,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, 1 run eased down to third man for an easy single"
272,"Tremain to Miller, 2 runs brilliant effort by Zampa at third man keeps that to two. Got a thick edge off a wild swing, he wanted to hit it over cover but it was a slower delivery as well, which meant he had to generate all the power"
273,"Tremain to Miller, 2 runs back-of-the-hand slower delivery that has been slapped into the gap at deep extra cover, Travis Head with a sliding stop. If he was hoping for some relief after all that bowling, not to be"
274,"Tremain to Miller, 1 wide another back-of-the-hand slower one that goes horribly wrong and slips outside the side line. Keeper collects on the bounce"
275,"Tremain to Miller, 1 run short and wide outside off, bunted wide of cover"
276,"Tremain to Phehlukwayo, 1 run nips back in from outside off, deflected down to third man"
277,"Boland to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs he's clobbered that into the stands at deep midwicket. He set himself for that biff and the short ball merely aided him as he swung across the line to generate the power"
278,"Boland to Phehlukwayo, 1 run drilled down to long-on. Much fuller this time from the bowler"
279,"Boland to Miller, FOUR runs helped into the fine leg boundary. Short delivery down leg and Miller just flicked that nonchalantly behind square"
280,"Boland to Miller, 1 run squeezed to long-off this time"
281,"Boland to Phehlukwayo, OUT super delivery. Death rattle. This is full and straight on middle, he looks to back away and squeeze that behind point but the ball clattered into the stumps off a very fine inside-edge."
282,"Boland to Rabada, 1 run low full toss, eased down to long-off"
283,"Tremain to Miller, 2 runs top effort by Zampa at third man to cut that off. Miller got down low and opened the bat face late to squeeze that full delivery into the gap"
284,"Tremain to Miller, FOUR runs short and he's helped it along into the deep backward square leg boundary. He'll pick those away even if he's woken up to play that in the middle of his sleep. It was sitting up nicely for him to execute it too."
285,"Tremain to Miller, no run chopped to the keeper, wanted to guide it down to third man but the ball nipped back in a wee bit from length"
286,"Tremain to Miller, 1 run pulled, this time in front of square to Finch at deep midwicket"
287,"Tremain to Rossouw, OUT slogged across the line, and he's holed out to Mitch Marsh at long-on. It was the slower one which he didn't completely get underneath and only managed to skew it off the bottom half of the bat. He knew immediately that it wasn't timed well. Rossouw walks off to a round of applause, this has been a super knock"
288,"Tremain to Miller, no run chopped to short third man again, too close to cut"
289,"Head to Phehlukwayo, no run fired full on off, pushed to cover"

293,"Head to Phehlukwayo, 1 run stretches forward and eases it to cover for a quick single"
294,"Head to Miller, 1 run punched down to long-off, sensible stuff"
295,"Tremain to Rabada, no run hurried for pace by a short delivery on middle, he gets on top of the bounce and dabs it to the off side"
296,"Tremain to Rabada, 1 leg bye nips back in to beat the inside edge and deflect off the pad to short third man"
297,"Tremain to Miller, OUT picks out Steven Smith at deep cover. Looked like he wanted to hit it to wide long-off but stiff breeze may have played part in him not hitting it where it wanted. It was a slower delivery too, which made it all the more tougher for Miller. Useful knock nonetheless"
298,"Tremain to Abbott, 1 wide rip roaring bouncer first up, Abbott sways out of the way but umpire deems it a little too high. Touched close to 140 clicks with that"
299,"Tremain to Abbott, OUT pokes at that without any conviction and the thick edge has been well taken by Wade, who dives full-length forward to complete the low catch. Third umpire was called for and replays only confirmed Wade's belief."
300,"Tremain to Steyn, no run swing and a miss. Looked to back away and slap that over point"
301,"Tremain to Steyn, FOUR runs squirted over backward point. Looked to go over cover, but he still gets the desired result. The ball flew off a thick edge. Useful runs"
302,"Boland to Rabada, 1 run drilled down to long-off, on the bounce to Finch. Struck that sweetly"
303,"Boland to Steyn, 4 byes follows the batsman by spearing a yorker that cramps Steyn for room, but Wade, who is perhaps unsighted, makes a mess of that as it deflects to the fine leg boundary"
304,"Boland to Steyn, 1 run low full toss that has been swung across the line to deep midwicket"
305,"Boland to Rabada, SIX runs he's hit that into Durban or what? Length ball on middle, Rabada is down on one knee as he swings across to send that soaring way over the deep midwicket boundary. Wow"
306,"Boland to Rabada, 1 run squeezed to cover, excellent yorker on that occasion"
307,"Boland to Steyn, 1 run gets a thick inside edge off a wild slog, straight to deep square"
308,"5:00pm Right, then. Two ways of looking at this. Would South Africa have taken this at 52 for 3? Yes, probably. Would Australia have taken a target of 328 when the hosts were cruising along during that 178-stand between Duminy and Rossouw? Most definitely. That said, this has been a good comeback, considering 350. Joe Mennie can be proud of his efforts - 3 for 49 - on a surface that had very little for the bowlers. The series is gone,"
309,A solitary slip at the moment
310,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run too short. Short of a length down leg, Warner whips it away to fine leg for one."
311,"Abbott to Finch, no run 132 kph, good length on middle, shovelled to midwicket"
312,"Abbott to Finch, no run ooh, maybe not wide enough to play that stroke. Fullish length outside off, Finch stays in his crease and tries to punch through cover, but the ball comes back enough to take the inside edge onto the pad"
313,"Abbott to Finch, no run 133 kph, superb stuff. Sticks with a good length, gets enough away movement to beat the bat. Beautiful bowling"
314,"Abbott to Finch, no run and again, 135 kph. Good length outside off, away swing and Finch's beaten."
315,"Abbott to Finch, no run 133 kph, fullish outside off, blocked towards mid-off"
316,"Rabada to Warner, 2 runs lovely running. Even better batting. Good length on off and middle, absolutely nothing wrong with that. Warner's technique is such that he always stays leg side of the ball to find gaps through the off side. He opens the face this time and finds the gap behind point for two"
317,"Rabada to Warner, no run good length on middle, blocked"
318,"Rabada to Warner, no run ooh, width. 140 kph, outside off. The ball moves away late. Warner swished and missed. Wanted to go straight past the bowler"
319,"Rabada to Warner, no run dropped. 138 kph, good length on off. Warner, with his leg side technique, tries to dab one down to third man. He ends up steering one straight to Amla at wide slip. Quinton de Kock, through, dives away to his right and spills a very tough chance. Definitely Amla's catch"
320,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run pushed to mid-on. 145 ks, a throw to the non-strikers end ends up in overthrows, one"
321,"Rabada to Finch, no run good length around off. Blocked. Good stuff from Finch, playing this testing period out"
322,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs what respite. My word, what a greeting. Shortish outside off, Warner sees the length early and then pulls through midwicket with disdain. Cross-seam from Steyn."
323,"Steyn to Warner, no run 137 kph, good length down leg, Warner tries to nudge into the leg side but pops back a leading edge"
324,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs and again. Not very short - on middle and leg. Warner was waiting for that, gets the length he wanted and swatted Steyn through midwicket. In the vacant region and four more"
325,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs more runs. Fantastic batting from Warner. Good length outside off, Warner backs away, giving himself room and lofts the ball over mid-off. Didn't bother keeping it down."
326,"Steyn to Warner, no run good length on middle, Warner wanted to keep that out or dab one to third man but gets a bit of inswing. Inside edged onto the pad"
327,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run worked into the leg side where Amla is stationed. Warner wanted one, Amla is quick on it but lobs his throw back. A better fielder and a direct hit would have had FInch"
328,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs shovelled for four. Hmm. Interesting. Overpitched on off, Warner cleared his leg and looked to go straight but the ball skews off the inside half and races away through midwicket for four."
329,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs four more. Sloppy fielding and Warner gets four more. Shortish and wide outside off, pushed straight towards extra cover where Phehlukwayo just lets it go through"
330,"Rabada to Warner, 2 runs just wide of Duminy. Shortish and wide, Warner wanted to go over point but just about manages to get it past Duminy"
331,"Rabada to Warner, no run ooh, snorter. Smell that. Back of a length on off, the angle gets this back to Warner who gets his hands up and fends to point. Fantastic contest"
332,"Rabada to Warner, (no ball) FOUR runs no ball and four runs. Short down leg is Rabada, Warner helps it along to the fine leg boundary. Easy"
333,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run 144 kph, full toss on leg. Warner backs away and squeezes this down to third man"
334,"Rabada to Finch, no run good length on off to finish. Hitting 140 kph consistently. Blocked by Finch"
335,"Steyn to Warner, no run full and straight from Steyn, better. Driven back to the bowler"
336,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run slower cutter down leg, nudged to deep square leg for a single"
337,"Steyn to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, very tight to Finch who pushes to mid-off from the back foot"
338,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run nice from Finch. Back of a length outside off, pushed out to mid-on who is slightly deep. Despite being on the back foot. Finch makes the run easily"
339,"Steyn to Warner, no run a slower delivery outside off, played to cover. Good changes in pace from Steyn"
340,"Steyn to Warner, no run good end. Another cutter on off, tapped towards point. A tight over, tight lines"
341,"Abbott to Finch, no run good length outside off, maybe a tad too much width? Finch punches but finds extra cover"
342,"Abbott to Finch, FOUR runs oh what a shot. And it finds the gap at wide mid-off. Back of a length outside off, natural stroke-making would indicate the ball shouldn't be going there. He stays back and muscles a punch past cover and mid-off"
343,"Abbott to Finch, FOUR runs short, wide and put away. Finch stands tall and nails his slap to the other side of cover this time. Runs leaking"
344,"Abbott to Finch, no run good length down leg, worked away towards midwicket"
345,"Abbott to Finch, no run good length outside off, 130 ks. Pushed to cover"
346,"Abbott to Finch, no run end of a fantastic Powerplay for Australia. Short and wide outside off, scythed to point."
347,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run full outside off, Warner comes down and shovels his swat to deep square leg"
348,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run good length outside off, pushed to deep cover for a single. A good single. 144 kph"
349,"Steyn to Warner, no run full on off, lovely channels. Blocked by Warner"
350,"Steyn to Warner, 1 leg bye big, big appeal. no, says the umpire Joel Wilson. Big inside edge, but the umpire didn't think so because he signalled leg byes. Fullish on leg, Warner smashes the ball into his pad and a run to third man ensues"
351,"Steyn to Finch, no run nice lines, gets a bit of movement but Finch blocks"
352,"Steyn to Finch, no run good end. Back of a length outside off at 143 kph. Pushed towards cover"
353,"Abbott to Warner, no run good length on off, superb channel this. 132 kph, defended into the cover region"
354,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run gives himself room and creates more width than there was. Shortish outside off, cut down to third man"
355,"Abbott to Finch, 1 run dropped. Almost a sensational catch from Steyn. Short and wide from Abbott, not a good delivery, but Finch cuts. Some extra bounce leads to a thick top edge which flies down to Steyn at third man. Steyn thought it was a tougher catch that it was, ran in and sideways, got there and the ball bounces out. Great effort, Steyn underestimated his own athletic prowess"
356,"Abbott to Warner, no run good length on middle and leg, played into the leg side"
357,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run shortish delivery and straight, flat-batted swat to deep square leg"
358,"Abbott to Finch, no run phew, how did that miss? Almost another typical Finch dismissal. Abbott can't believe it. Full length outside off, Finch wants to go straight down, over mid-on, but the ball swings back in and somehow misses off stump"
359,"Steyn to Warner, no run good from Steyn. Full on middle, pushed back to Steyn"
360,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs gets through and that will be four. Overpitched outside off, Warner forces his drive through cover and gets four. Fantastic timing. Rossouw hustles across from sweeper cover but the work is too much"
361,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run good from Warner. Full and straight, pushed down to long-on"
362,"Steyn to Finch, no run 138 kph, change in length. Shortish length on off, Finch is beaten and the ball pings off his body towards the keeper"
363,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run another back of a length delivery at 136 kph. Finch pulls down to fine leg. A bit uppish but didn't get enough on that"
364,"Steyn to Warner, no run good length on off, 137 kph. Steered to point"
365,"Tahir to Finch, no run flatter delivery on leg, played away towards midwicket"
366,"Tahir to Finch, no run big appeal, but that clearly struck him outside off. Flight outside off from Tahir, Finch gets low and looks to sweep but inside-edges onto his pad"
367,"Tahir to Finch, no run googly on middle and leg, Finch goes back, doesn't quite pick it and pushes to cover"
368,"Tahir to Smith, no run beautiful, slow through the air but gets the ball to skid. Smith waits and then is hustled as he blocks"
369,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run good length on leg, nudged towards midwicket for a run. Warner brings up his fifty. This has been a superb knock from him. Weill need to double this, at least"

371,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run full and wide outside off, steered towards point"
372,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, 1 run short and wide outside off, 134 kph. Too much width, slashed to deep cover. Got on top of the bounce"

376,"Tahir to Bailey, no run wrong'un but he has the line well covered as he smothers the spin"
377,"Tahir to Bailey, 1 run touch short, he rocks back to punch one to mid-on"
378,"Tahir to Warner, no run tosses it up nicely, inviting Warner to go over the top, but he's happy to block"
379,"Tahir to Warner, no run leading edge but lands short of short third man. Warner didn't pick the googly and looked to work it across the line over midwicket"
380,"Tahir to Warner, no run pushes it through quicker and fuller outside off, Warner defends from the crease"
381,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run floats this at length on middle from wide of the crease, the ball keeps a touch low but Bailey is behind the line as he blocks"
382,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run driven on the up but straight to backward point"
383,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run gets this to jag away from outside off, Marsh hops back to bunt that to point"
384,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run gets on top of the bounce and dabs the short delivery to the off side"
385,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run rooted to the crease as he plays back to a full delivery on off stump. Hit straight to point"
386,"Tahir to Warner, 1 run slow turn back in, tapped gently to point for a quick single. Risky, but Rabada's throw was wayward"

388,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run drifting into the pads, worked to long-on"
389,"Tahir to Warner, no run beaten by a superb googly. Warner looks to open the bat face late to slap that past cover, but was deceived in flight"
390,"Tahir to Warner, no run beaten again, another googly that does him in the air. This is outstanding legspin bowling"
391,"Tahir to Warner, no run checks his drive this time to a slider on off stump"
392,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run uppish but safe, flies off the thick edge to third man"
393,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run pulled but the ball wasn't all that short for him to wind up like the way he did, mistimed to deep midwicket"
394,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 2 runs flicked, but finds deep square leg. Her had to come around a fair bit which gave Marsh an opportunity to amble back for the second"
395,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run length ball at 134kph, Marsh hops back and punches that to cover"
396,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run this one's floated a touch fuller from length outside off, Marsh defends from the crease"
397,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run the bowler does well to react quickly on his followthrough to stop that rocket drive with his boot"
398,"Tahir to Warner, no run fizzes straight on from middle, Warner gets back and blocks"
399,"Tahir to Warner, 1 run driven through the line to wide long-off, much more authority in the stroke this time"
400,"Tahir to Marsh, no run wrong'un that lands outside off to draw Marsh forward, he deadbats it in the end"
401,"Tahir to Marsh, no run this one spins away, Marsh doesn't get to the pitch of the ball but manages to bunt that to cover"

412,"Tahir to Marsh, 1 run drifting full into the pads, eased to long-on"
413,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR runs lofted, and lofted very nicely. Almost shoveled that off the front foot. The bat face just turned a wee bit when he made contact but he still placed it where he wanted to. The power of the bottom hand"
414,"Tahir to Warner, no run stretches forward and defends gently"
415,"Tahir to Warner, no run sharp turn back in from off stump, Warner uses the depth of the crease to defend"
416,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 wide ill-directed short ball outside leg stump, batsman lets it go"

418,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run crunching cover drive, Tahir does well to come around the ropes to restrict that to a single"

435,"Rabada to Marsh, SIX runs Palmed over the ropes by Abbott at deep square leg. But let me tell you it was a tough chance. This was short and angling in, Marsh decided he's going to pull, got good enough bat on it too. Had Abbott been on the ropes, it would have been straight down his throat."
436,"Rabada to Marsh, 1 run confusion, confusion! Marsh is ball-watching as he bunts it to point, Warner had almost completed the run even as Marsh was halfway down the pitch. A direct hit at the bowler's end would have nailed him. Duminy the fielder in question, would have been close at both ends"
437,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run plays a short-arm jab to midwicket"
438,"Rabada to Marsh, SIX runs this is an even better stroke. Short and angling in, he swivels back, gets underneath it and pulls him into the fine leg boundary. Total control"

444,"Abbott to Marsh, 1 run flayed on the up to Tahir at sweeper cover"

451,"Rabada to Head, FOUR runs top shot! Balance, timing, wrist work and placement - all in sync as it races into the midwicket boundary. Too full from Rabada and he was punished on that occasion"

454,"Duminy to Head, 1 run eased back past the bowler to long-on"

458,"Rabada to Head, no run ripper of a delivery that squares Head up. Wasn't far from the outside edge"

460,"Rabada to Head, 1 run arches back and helps it up and over the cordon, one bounce to third man"
461,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs finds the gap and the timing on that is magnificent. Hops back and then simply opens the face of the bat to steer that behind point. Third man, even though square, had no chance"
462,"Rabada to Warner, no run pushed straight to a diving Faf du Plessis at cover"
463,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs flayed into the extra cover boundary. It was hit so hard that JP Duminy, normally a very very safe fielder, had little time to react. He had no more than 5 metres to move to his right. What power! This isn't over yet"
464,"Phehlukwayo to Head, no run good length on middle and worked away towards midwicket. Cramping him for room"
465,"Phehlukwayo to Head, no run a big appeal, not given by ump Joel Wilson. Full and straight, Head misses and is rapped on the pad. May have pitched outside leg"

467,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, FOUR runs four more. A slower ball on Warner's thighs. You may want to bowl elsewhere to him. He wanted to put that onto the banks, but got more of the inside half of the bat, sending the ball past short fine leg. Warner on 95"
468,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run full on middle, 132 kph. Pushed to cover."
469,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, FOUR runs absolute rubbish from Phehlukwayo. Warner takes full toll. Slow offcutter well down leg. Warner just helps it along to the fine leg boundary. Would have been wide had he not got bat on that. Moves to 99."
470,"Steyn to Head, no run full and wide at 136 kph. Head doesn't back down, looks to go down the ground but misses. Big swing, big miss"
471,"Steyn to Head, 1 run crashed away through cover for one."
472,"Steyn to Warner, no run doesn't quite get there. Overpitched from Steyn outside off, Warner picks the right stroke and drives to cover. Can't pierce the gap"
473,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run 100 for Warner. Subdued in celebration. Takes off his helmet and acknowledges the applause. Full on leg, pushed to mid-on and calls for one immediately. Easy. Take a bow, splendid innings"
474,"Steyn to Head, FOUR runs ah poor ball. Full and wide outside off, too much wifdth. Head throws his hands at that and gets it over point. Another boundary"
475,"Steyn to Head, no run rather full outside off, crisply driven to mid-off"
476,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run 132 kph, bad lines these. Not good. Down leg and Warner misses the freebie. Rapped on the pad"
477,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run and again, down leg. 129 kph. Warner picks it off, clips to fine leg. Not great bowling this"
478,"Phehlukwayo to Head, no run 129 kph, better line. Full but on middle and off. Head inside edges onto his pad. Had he missed that, he was plumb. A bit of inward movement too."
479,"Phehlukwayo to Head, no run 131 kph, seems pretty good to Head but loses his line to Warner. Straight on a good length, no room and so Head works to midwicket"

481,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 2 runs just not good bowling this. An easy nudge through the leg side gives Warner and Australia two more to backward square"
482,"Steyn to Head, no run short of a length outside off, Head tries to go over midwicket but was clearly hurries for pace. Bunts to mid-on"
483,"Steyn to Head, no run full on middle and off, giving nothing away. Blocked"
484,"Steyn to Head, 1 run good length outside off, carved down to third man"
485,"Steyn to Warner, 3 runs over mid-of. Short of a length outside off, Warner tries to go over the top. Doesn't get all of it, but gets enough to clear mid-off. Plinks in the outfield. Splendid running gives Warner three"
486,"Steyn to Head, 1 run 139 kph, nice lines on off. Steered to third man"
487,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run 132 kph, slow on middle and leg. Seemed like an offcutter. Worked towards square leg"

489,"Phehlukwayo to Head, 1 run 134 kph, straying down leg, leading edge towards mid-on for one"
490,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 2 leg byes good length on middle, Warner is hurried and gets hit on the thigh. The ball ricochets to point who unnecessarily fires a throw at the non-strikers end. Concedes the overthrow. If you're good at saving runs, have to be able to prevent these kind of runs too. Fine margins in this sport"
491,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 wide strays down leg this time, wide. Very surprised this is the line Phehlukwayo has stuck to"
492,"Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run another one. The bowler is not happy. Overpitched outside off, driven straight to Miller at cover who fires a throw, hits the stumps at the strikers end and concedes one. Two extra runs in this over."

497,"Tahir to Head, 1 run slow legbreak on off, Head outside-edges towards short third man for one. Playing him nicely"

507,"Tahir to Warner, no run slow through the air on middle and off, Warner gets low to reverse lap. Misses. Struck on the body"
508,"Tahir to Warner, 2 leg byes big appeal, Tahir wants a review. Faf has a look at Qdk and opts to review. Only question here is if it was pitching in line? Looked like it did, but hit Warner on the thigh. A flat delivery on leg, Warner gets low to sweep but misses. The ball carries on and hits Warner on the thigh, two leg byes to fine leg, the result. All on hawkeye now. Yikes, pitched just outside leg. Excellent decision from"

514,"Steyn to Head, FOUR runs picks the length early. To be fair, wasn't nearly short enough ti pull. But Head was hanging back, gets the length he wanted and slaps his pull in the gap at midwicket. There's the boundary for the over"

524,"Tahir to Warner, 2 runs wrong un, pushed to over. A misfield and a parry allows two"
525,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run slapped to point where a half-stop jeeps it down to a single. Faf is withering in pain. Has he damaged his finger? He seems in severe pain. Faf was off balance when the ball took off from one of the patches and smashed into his finger."

547,"Rabada to Tremain, no run gets right underneath that yorker outside off to keep it out"
548,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as he backs away to slash. The deflection nearly rolls onto the stumps. Brings up his 150 Muted celebrations, but I'm sure it will be anything but that should he take the side past the line"
549,"Abbott to Tremain, no run beaten outside off by a delivery that deviates away from the length area outside off"
550,"Abbott to Tremain, OUT what athleticism from Faf! Outstanding work to effect a run-out. In the end, Tremain has sacrificed his wicket. He got a thick inside edge towards midwicket where Phehlukwayo intially looked for an under-arm flick as the bowler was still on his followthrough. Faf wasn't even in the picture even as the flick came in. But he dived full-length across to nearly dive into the stumps. But he ensured he disturbe"

574,"9.35pm Fourth clean sweep for South Africa in a five-match series, the first time they're achieving this feat against Australia. For a long time, this looked like a contest between David Warner and South Africa. But Warner's dismissal for 173 hastened the end for the visitors. That the hosts put themselves in this position was largely due to a 178-run stand between Duminy and Rossouw, who made a sparkling century. Then Tahir came into"
