241,"Australia have battled their way to 266, largely thanks to Glenn Maxwell and an anchoring innings from Aaron Finch. A lot of Pakistan's bowling was very good, but the fielding let them down again. They will, however, know what they need to do with the bat rather than setting"
242,"7.28pm The drizzle appears to have moved off for now, and the Australians spill onto the outfield ahead of their defence of 266. Pakistan have to chase that number down to keep the series alive. Imam ul Haq will face the first ball. Shan Masood's at the other end. And the re"

245,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Cummins hits the splice off a length, Imam right behind it to defend"
246,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam's off the mark with a flick off his pads. He might have chanced a second, but he slipped slightly while turning at the non-striker's end. It's greasy out there"
247,"Cummins to Masood, no run bursting across Shan at 142km/h, the left hander raising his hands to leave. Good pace, and an upright seam"

260,"Cummins to Masood, 1 run squirting off the inside edge as Shan fends awkwardly from the crease, the ball bouncing between his legs but away from the stumps into the leg side. It definitely skidded on"
261,"Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run short and rising outside off, Imam opting out of a pull shot at the last moment"
262,"Behrendorff to Masood, 1 run neatly worked off the pads by Shan, but there's protection in the deep"

268,"Cummins to Masood, no run angling in from outside off, Shan defending to point"
269,"Cummins to Masood, OUT snaffled by a diving Handscomb at slip! Cummins gets the ball to straighten on Shan from around the stumps. The line makes him play, the movement finds the edge, and Handscomb at the solitary slip dives to his left to get a hand under the ball in"
270,"Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run pushed through outside off, but too wide to force him to play"
271,"Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run this one angles in from outside off and it's slightly closer to the stumps, but Haris is in no danger as he hops into a leave"

276,"Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run and again! Imam steps into a tentative push but the left-armer hits the seam and beats the edge. There's no bat on it, but it doesn't carry to the keeper"

282,"Cummins to Haris Sohail, OUT another edge! The plan is the same, and Cummins executes it to perfection to get another one. He angles it in, seams it away, and Haris goes fishing outside off to send a regulation edge through to Marsh at first slip. A regulation chance,"
283,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run some seam movement straight away, nipping in to hit Rizwan on the thigh"
284,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run wider of off, and it's left alone"
285,"Cummins to Rizwan, OUT past the edge! Or has he got him? Australia appeal, Cummins is convinced, and likewise convinces Finch to take a review when the umpire says no. Kumar Dharmasena is the third umpire, and he notes a sound as ball passes bat. And ultra edge shows a"

289,"Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run appeal for lbw! This one snaked in to him off the track to hit him on the pad. The umpire says no, and there's a bit of discussion ... but they decide against a review. It did look high, hitting him above the roll"
