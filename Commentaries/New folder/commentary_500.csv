53,"Randiv to White, no run is that a missed stumping? down the leg side, White was down the track when he misses the ball, Sangakkara can't collect and it rolls to short fine leg, perhaps there was a deflection off the pads as it wasn't called a wide"

79,"Randiv to Clarke, no run used his feet, defended to covers"
80,"Randiv to Clarke, OUT Randiv's super day continues, Clarke makes room to cut, he misses and the off bail is on the floor, there's some confusion whether the ball hit stumps or whether it was the keeper's gloves that dislodged the bail, replays show the ball hit the top of offstump, and Clarke has to go"

91,"Welegedara to White, SIX runs not so super this time as his full toss on middle stump isn't low enough, White gets under it and absolutely powers it to the sightscreen, brutal from White"
92,"Welegedara to White, SIX runs undoes all the good work at the start of the over with another hit-me ball, on legstump this time, White gets his front leg out of the way and dismisses it over wide long-on, did I mention White's a powerful batsmen?"

They haven't won the game yet though, Sri Lanka's batsmen have a tough ask ahead of them though. Remains to be seen whether they opt to open with Jayasuriya or Dilshan."
125,"Jayasuriya will open and with him is the in-form Jayawardene. Sri Lanka have a tough task ahead, after squandering the early advantage with the ball to be left chasing a challenging target. Dirk Nannes has the ball; he troubled India aplenty with his nippy short deliveries. Two slips."
