8,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, no run back of a length on off stump at 138 kph, defended to backward point."
9,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, no run fullish length on the legs, Fletcher is late flicking at this 129 kph delivery, stifled lbw shout. Missing leg."
10,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, 1 run back of a length on fourth stump, fraction of width to slice this to deep third man."

15,"Behrendorff to Fletcher, (no ball) 1 run slower ball lands full on middle and off at 94 kph, Fletcher keeps his hands back barely long enough to flick this through square leg. Third umpire has signaled on field that Behrendorff has overstepped. Replays show he w"
16,"Behrendorff to Lewis, (no ball) another slower ball lands on a good length on off stump, Lewis way out in front. But Behrendorff has overstepped by an even bigger margin so the free hit is still in play."

18,"Behrendorff to Lewis, no run back of a length slower ball on fifth stump, pushed gently to backward point."
19,"Behrendorff to Lewis, no run nearly bounced out! Behrendorff bangs it in short on fourth stump, it climbs on Lewis going to pull and a thick top edge flutters into no man's land between mid-off and Behrendorff, who can't track back fast enough after spinning and r"
20,"Behrendorff to Lewis, SIX runs full delivery speared a foot outside leg stump, Lewis could have easily left this but plays a sort of sweep and connects sweetly over fine leg to send it flat and powerfully over the rope."

22,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, SIX runs full on off, Fletcher charges and clocks this cleanly high and deep over Hazlewood into the sightscreen."

24,"Hazlewood to Lewis, 1 run yorker on off stump, Lewis digs this out into the leg side for a tightly scampered single."
25,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, no run Fletcher charges again, telegraphing it too early this time and Hazlewood bounces it very short on fifth stump as Fletcher flails wildly at it and misses."
26,"Hazlewood to Fletcher, 1 run attempted yorker on leg stump, flicked out to deep backward square for a single to end the over."
27,"Zampa to Fletcher, OUT Fletcher yorks himself. Not the greatest ball from Zampa, and definitely not the greatest shot from Fletcher. Should have been converted into a full toss but Fletcher is a deer in the headlights staring at this full delivery while rooted to"
28,"Zampa to Gayle, FOUR runs very full again on off stump, Gayle presses a firm drive through extra cover and it beats the man on the ring all the way to the rope. Almost the same ball bowled to Gayle, and the shot Fletcher really should have played the previous ball"
29,"Zampa to Gayle, no run googly lands full on leg stump, blocked back by Gayle."
30,"Zampa to Gayle, SIX runs hello! Flighted full on the legs again, this time Gayle opens up and heaves a slog sweep to send this high and deep over midwicket."
31,"Zampa to Gayle, FOUR runs Zampa overcompensates bowling too flat, too quick, too short and too wide outside off, Gayle punishes it with a cut past cover diving to his right and it goes all the way."
32,"Zampa to Gayle, SIX runs mighty mighty boss! Zampa flights this up generously on fourth stump, full enough and with a fraction of width to encourage another sumptuous slog for long-on and Gayle connects sweetly clearing the rope and sending the ball 15 rows back i"
33,"Behrendorff to Lewis, FOUR runs overpitched on sixth stump, the length and width is there for Lewis to get into the act with a sizzling cover drive along the turf."
34,"Behrendorff to Lewis, SIX runs yikes! Meatball of a full toss at knee height on off stump, Behrendorff adds some marinara sauce for Lewis to feast on by licking this over wide long-on."
35,"Behrendorff to Lewis, SIX runs overpitched now on fifth stump at 131 kph, Lewis with a pendulum swing of a straight drive over long-off, clocks this into the first row of the second deck of the grandstand."
36,"Behrendorff to Lewis, 1 wide wide yorker attempted, lands outside the guidelines and will have to be rebowled."
37,"Behrendorff to Lewis, no run wide yorker again, this time lands it just inside the guidelines and is left alone by Lewis hoping in vain for a wide. It was definitely legal."
38,"Behrendorff to Lewis, no run Behrendorff's towel falls out of his waist as he charges in to deliver and Lewis pulls out but the umpire lets this full delivery outside off count as legal."
39,"Behrendorff to Lewis, FOUR runs another low full toss at shin height on seventh stump, Lewis hammers it flat along the turf and it screams past Tye at mid-off to the rope once more."

41,"Swepson to Lewis, 1 run googly lands on a fullish length on middle and spins away, Lewis goes back to flick through midwicket."
42,"Swepson to Gayle, OUT googly flighted full and very wide on seventh stump, Gayle is sucked into another big heave but unlike the balls that went for six against Zampa the previous over, the extra width is too much for Gayle to play a comfortable shot and his swipe"
43,"Swepson to Lewis, 1 wide stock legbreak lands short and a yard outside leg stump, Lewis goes to pull but misses, lucky not to go for five as it deflects off Wade to short fine leg."

48,"Tye to Lewis, 1 wide bouncer at full pace over off stump at 128 kph, too high to play and wide is signaled from square leg."

50,"Tye to Lewis, FOUR runs cutter bowled on a good length on sixth stump at 122 kph, Lewis is able to time this one elegantly past backward point and deep third man can't cut it off. 23-ball half-century up for Lewis."

178,"Thomas to Finch, no run full on off, defended."
179,"Thomas to Finch, FOUR runs rib high full toss, Finch opens the face to run this wide of third man for a boundary. Very fortunate not to be called a no ball on height. It was well over waist height. Huge miss by both umpires really. It was obvious enough to have be"
