0,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run a thick inside edge to a clumpy, leaden-footed defensive by Watson. Ball could've gone anywhere"
1,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run Warner steps forward, driving to point"
2,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run beautiful timing but this time he picks out cover"
3,"Angelo Mathews to Warner, OUT got him! Slightly shorter by Matthews and Warner cuts and slaps it straight into the hands of point!"
4,"Angelo Mathews to Ponting, no run shoulders arms outside off - and this one's a right old grubber. Scoots through low to the keeper"
5,"Angelo Mathews to Ponting, no run Ponting comes forward and defends with a squirt of the blade to point"
6,"Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run flat, on middle and defended"
7,"Jayasuriya to Ponting, no run flicked around the corner"
8,"Jayasuriya to Ponting, 1 run goes for a pull but can't time it, and they scamper a single"
9,"Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run clamps onto this, driving to mid-on"
10,"Jayasuriya to Ponting, FOUR runs beautiful, orthodox back-foot drive! That's classical and elegant"
11,"Jayasuriya to Ponting, no run drives to mid-off"
12,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run Watson tries to pull but somehow can't connect. It begged to be smacked over midwicket but it just rushed onto him a little"
13,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run flicked behind square and they set off for a single - this'll be tight, but Jayawardene's throw is wide!"
14,"Angelo Mathews to Ponting, FOUR runs goes for a cut and inside-edges it past his stumps for four! It's all a bit harum-scarum here"
15,"Angelo Mathews to Ponting, 3 runs oh, shot. But that's a poor effort at extra cover, the ball flying through his legs"
16,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run the wrong line and it's flicked off his pads, but there's a short fine-leg to prevent the single"
17,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 wide down the leg side and Sangakkara roars an appeal, more in hope of it not being wided than a genuine shout"
18,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run Watson defends to cover, coming massively forward ala Hayden"
19,"Udana to Ponting, 1 run on middle-and-off, Ponting drives watchfully without power to the diving mid-off. Good, sprawling stop"
20,"Udana to Watson, FOUR runs lofted with ugly, caveman power over long-on. Really did smack that!"
21,"Udana to Watson, FOUR runs fortuitous shot. A thick outside edge flies down to third man, but good intent showed by Watson here, unsettling the young bowler"
22,"Udana to Watson, SIX runs six more! Beautiful from Watson, just picking it up off his legs and timing it magnificently. Bish, bash, bosh"
23,"Udana to Watson, no run angled across him and Watson shaped to play before withdrawing his bat at the last moment"
24,"Udana to Watson, no run slower ball - 59mph - which he tried to slap through midwicket but missed"
25,"Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs starts with a delivery much too straight. Ponting needs no second invitation, clipping it with excellent timing down to fine leg"
26,"Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs fantastic stroke from Ponting once more. Came walking down the pitch, opened the face and cracked it square of the wicket - that bounced quite a bit, but he rode it quite perfectly. Top, top shot"
27,"Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs mistimed over mid-on - and only just over the fielder. I thought initially he'd hit the cover off it, but he clearly hadn't"
28,"Malinga to Ponting, 2 wide a full bunger down the leg side"

31,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run a full toss at 86.7mph (75.34 knots, 38.76 metres-per-second), bashed back to the bowler"
32,"Mendis to Watson, no run that's missed everything I think! The zooter hurries on, Watson didn't pick it and it flicked his pad on the way through - excellent take"
33,"Mendis to Watson, no run short of a length and defended out to mid-off. Short mid-off, actually"
34,"Mendis to Watson, 1 run short, pulled"
35,"Mendis to Ponting, no run and this one bounces, Ponting goes back and defends out to the off side"
36,"Mendis to Ponting, no run good pace, 57mph, and Ponting pushes it out cautiously to the off side"
37,"Mendis to Ponting, OUT bowled him! Ponting stepped outside leg trying to smite him over cover but loses his leg stump. Looked to me like a leggie from Mendis"
38,"Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run short of a length and nicely tucked off his hip"
39,"Jayasuriya to Haddin, 1 run flatter and quicker, patted to leg"
40,"Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run well wide of the off stump, no feet movement and Watson reaches for it, slapping it back past the bowler"

42,"Jayasuriya to Haddin, SIX runs shot. Shot indeed. Down onto one knee to this quicker ball and sweeps him out of the ground. This guy is some batsman"

44,"Mendis to Haddin, no run fuller delivery, jabs down on it"
45,"Mendis to Haddin, 1 run quicker ball flicked to leg"
46,"Mendis to Watson, OUT gone! Watson attempts a horrible sweep to this very full and straight delivery, and he's hit on the back pad. Poor stroke - quality bowling"
47,"Mendis to Clarke, no run defends solidly"
48,"Mendis to Clarke, 2 runs flicked to fine leg for a single - no, they're coming back for two and the throw's accurate and hard. A direct hit would've had Clarke heading back to the dug-out, without a doubt"
49,"Mendis to Clarke, no run big shout as he went for a sweep - looks a very good shout to me, but it's not out"
50,"Udana to Haddin, no run forced off the back foot into the covers"
51,"Udana to Haddin, 2 runs very, very slow! Pats it out down to third man and they get two. This pair are so fast between the wickets - watching them is a great exercise for kids in how to run"
52,"Udana to Haddin, 1 run fuller delivery driven out to long-off"
53,"Udana to Clarke, 1 run very slow ball again outside off, guided down to third man who wings in a very accurate throw which knocks over the bails"

55,"Udana to Clarke, no run back-cut to backward point"

66,"Malinga to Haddin, 1 run sweetly timed but straight to a wide mid-off"
67,"Malinga to Clarke, 1 run flicked to leg"
68,"Malinga to Haddin, OUT bowled him! Comical cricket. A slower full-toss which Haddin seemed to pick, but it dipped late on him and splattered his stumps - the off stump and middle stump both flattened"

74,"Murali to Clarke, 1 run down the leg side and turned to short fine-leg"
75,"Udana to Clarke, 2 runs swung over midwicket"
76,"Udana to Clarke, OUT another one done by a slower delivery. Are you watching, England? Superb delivery on middle-and-leg which Clarke picked, but got a leading edge back to the bowler who took a great low catch with his left hand"
77,"Udana to Hussey, no run turned to leg"
78,"Udana to Hussey, 1 wide another very slow ball but it's too wide this time to the left-hander"

80,"Udana to Hussey, FOUR runs quicker ball and laced through the covers for four"
81,"Udana to Hussey, 1 run slower nut stroked to long-off"
82,"Murali to Hussey, no run rapped on the pads, huge shout - but it pitched outside the off stump. Just...and was a little high I think"
83,"Murali to Hussey, no run works it to leg"
84,"Murali to Hussey, no run the doosra squares him up, but he plays it well with late hands"
85,"Murali to Hussey, 1 run short, pulled through midwicket"

89,"Mendis to Hussey, 1 run pushed out to the off side"
90,"Mendis to Johnson, FOUR runs that was almost a medium pacer - outside off and Johnson back-cut it for four. Top, top shot"
91,"Mendis to Johnson, no run the straightest of bats meets the straightest of deliveries"
92,"Mendis to Johnson, 1 run down the pitch, cracks it to long-off"

94,"Malinga to Hussey, 1 run another slower ball on middle-and-leg"
95,"Malinga to Johnson, 2 runs down the leg side and very full, chipped it uppishly and is fortunate that it falls safe at midwicket. Could've flown anywhere"

97,"Malinga to Hussey, 1 run slow bouncer, pulled to nowhere"
98,"Malinga to Johnson, no run oh great ball! Johnson completely deceived by this slower ball and somehow doesn't lose his off stump"
99,"Mendis to Hussey, no run nearly another wicket for Mendis! Outside off, he tried to pull it from wide of the off stump and got a bottom edge"
100,"Mendis to Hussey, no run patted back to Mendis, nearly into his hands!"

102,"Mendis to Hussey, 1 run flicked back to the bowler"
103,"Mendis to Hussey, OUT what bowling. What belief and guile from Mendis. A quicker and fuller ball to Hussey who's rapped absolutely dead in front. Too quick, too straight"
104,"Mendis to Johnson, no run comes back into the left-hander and really rushes him - that was heading onto his off stump! Just got his bat down in time"
105,"Murali to Hussey, 1 run stroked to mid-off"
106,"Murali to Johnson, SIX runs big, big six. He didn't quite time his sweep-slog, skying it miles in the air, but it just about had the legs on it"
107,"Murali to Johnson, 3 runs a carving slap off the back foot"
108,"Murali to Hussey, 1 run comes confidently forward onto the front foot, meeting the pitch of the ball and flicking to leg"

110,"Murali to Johnson, FOUR runs clipped off his pads down to third man for four. Easy"
111,"Udana to Hussey, SIX runs that. Is. Huge. Brilliant shot, getting his front foot out of the way and clobbering it wide of long-on. Ping!"
112,"Udana to Hussey, OUT tries to repeat the shot but slices it high and point swallows it with ease"
113,"Udana to Johnson, 1 run slower ball, picked by Johnson who works him to long-on"
114,"Udana to Lee, FOUR runs bang! Terrific blow by Lee, hammering this back past the bowler for four. Heavy power"

120,"Malinga to Hauritz, FOUR runs clipped neatly off his legs for four down to fine leg"
121,"Malinga to Hauritz, OUT outside edge, another one for Malinga - well caught by Sangakkara low to his right"
122,"Malinga to Bracken, FOUR runs a thick inside edge for four! Great bonus for Australia there"
123,"7pm Well, 159 isn't the worst total, but Sri Lanka have been all over Australia this afternoon. Terrific bowling from Mendis and Malinga, and they ought to fancy themselves to chase 160. Back in 10 minutes, folks."

130,"Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 wide down the leg side and, whoopsy daisy - a wide"

136,"Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs pulled over midwicket - not quite timed but he's got enough of it!"
137,"Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs ah, beautiful from Dilshan - an orthodox cover-drive for four. Poise and style - no Twenty20 smasherama from him"
138,"Johnson to Dilshan, no run fast and swinging into his off stump, carved out to point"
139,"Lee to Jayasuriya, OUT what a catch from Warner at deep square leg! Jayasuriya pulled this hard and flat, and Warner jumped up high to take it behind him, not two feet from the boundary edge. Oh yes!"
140,"Lee to Sangakkara, no run very good line on off stump"
141,"Lee to Sangakkara, no run that's quick and short, this time, attacking the body"

146,"Bracken to Dilshan, no run Dilshan lines up another fearsomely driven four but the (very) short extra-cover fields it, and his hands must now surely be bleeding"
147,"Bracken to Dilshan, no run patted out to the off side"
148,"Bracken to Dilshan, 1 run dabbed out to the off side"
149,"Bracken to Sangakkara, FOUR runs crunched over mid-off for four. Down on one knee and hit cross-battedly with perfect placement and power"

152,"Watson to Dilshan, no run outside off and hammered but backward point scores a fine save to his right"
153,"Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs deft and quite brilliant sweep, on the full. How do you play that? Well, with vast amounts of cheek and confidence I suppose. Audacious and well appreciated by a cacophonous crowd"
154,"Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs uppercut over short third man. This is dreadful from Watson I'm afraid and Dilshan is all over him"
155,"Watson to Dilshan, no run angled to short third man. Better and fuller delivery"
156,"Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs another one! Flayed without a care in the world past backward point. Twenty20 batting at its most enjoyable"

172,"Watson to Dilshan, 2 runs a full toss, bashed out to extra cover"
173,"Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs that is disgraceful and brilliant! An amazing shot to bring up his fifty. He ducked beneath a good-length ball, flicking his bat up vertically to lift it over the keeper. You've seen batsman to these paddly up"

201,"Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, no run goes for a sweep and nearly top edges"

203,"Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run a huge shout as he goes for a sweep but is rapped on the pads, but it's perhaps spinning past the off stump. Perilously close"
204,"Clarke to Silva, 1 run swept hard but there's a sweeper out there"

217,"Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run clunked to the leg side, out to long-on on the boundary"
218,"Bracken to Silva, 1 run patted out to deep extra cover. Just a stroke there, no power in the stroke"
219,"Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run fuller delivery on his legs and they scamper a single. Good attempt by Haddin to flick a return onto the stumps"
220,"Bracken to Silva, no run goes for a slog sweep and Haddin appeals - as does Watson. They're convinced he's got a thin edge on that but Bowden's arm remains planted by his side. Australia are convinced - I have to say I didn't hear anythi"

232,"Bracken to Mubarak, 1 run flung over midwicket but not timed"
233,"Bracken to Sangakkara, FOUR runs paddle swept for four - brilliant! He made it into a full toss, just dabbing it past short third man. What guts"
