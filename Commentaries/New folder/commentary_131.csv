0,6.20pm Toss Aaron Finch has won the toss and Australia will bat first. Finch says the wicket is good so they want to put runs on the board. One change for Australia with Starc replacing Behrendorff. India captain Virat Kohli says he was happy to bowl first. India are unchanged again.

36,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run 144kph, he defends a good length and pushes this to cover-point and they pinch a tight one, there is a shy from Krunal at the non-strikers but he was home"
37,"Bumrah to Short, no run good length outside off, he drives on the up straight to cover"
38,"Bumrah to Short, FOUR runs full toss and square driven past point! A rare mistake from Bumrah. This was a wide full toss and Short just had to place it past point and it flies to the fence"

40,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run floated up, leg break, he skips down to the pinch and whips with the turn to deep midwicket"

49,"Krunal to Short, 1 run shorter length, he pulls hard to deep midwicket"
50,"Krunal to Finch, FOUR runs backs away, it's darted into leg, but short enough, he cuts past point and it beats the man at deep cover running around!"

56,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run shorter on middle and leg, he tries to give room but bunts it back to the bowler"
57,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, FOUR runs wrong un, he drives and times this so well past cover! What a shot. It beats the man at deep long off"
58,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run given out LBW! Maxwell reviews after a long discussion with Short. It pitches on middle, he tries to whip to leg, it beats the inside edge. Definitely no bat. Ball tracking says it pitched in line, and spinning down leg! Missing leg. Maxwell survives. Great review."
59,"Krunal to Short, OUT LBW! Again a long discussion and Short reviews! He tried to sweep, Krunal from around the wicket, it pitched in line, no bat involved. Ball tracking says it was in line, hit in line and was hitting! They lose the review this time. That was plumb."
60,"Krunal to McDermott, OUT LBW! Given out sweeping! He's on a hat-trick! First ball sweep shot, this was tossed up outside off from around the wicket, pitches outside, he tries to sweep, it slides on and hits the back leg, and Gerard Abood says it hit in line with off!"
61,"Krunal to Carey, 1 run around the wicket, pitching on middle, he turns this with the spin to square leg"
62,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up outside off, he pushes off the front foot to cover"

64,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run beaten this spins sharply past the edge as he drives"
65,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run a tad short, making him reach outside the off stump. Carey chops it in front of point"
66,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run loops it up onto off stump, Maxwell drives to extra cover"
67,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run seems like a top spinner, going through flat on off stump and not spinning a great deal. Maxwell goes back, perhaps wondering if he can cut it, but then has to block down the pitch"
68,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run good length, spinning into him, Maxwell tries to pull, but it doesn't rise as much as he wants"
69,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run hits to long off. Probably picks the googly"
70,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run loads up a big old sweep, dragging a tossed up ball from way outside off away to deep square leg"
71,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, no run goes short, the ball rising up to his chest. Carey gets up on tiptoe and nudges it to short midwicket"
72,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, no run looks for the clip through midwicket again, but he's underestimating Khaleel's bounce. In the end, the ball lobs off his thigh and into Khaleel's followthrough"
73,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, 1 run helps the back of a length delivery on off stump away to deep square leg. Short-arm pull done right"
74,"Khaleel Ahmed to Maxwell, FOUR runs top-edge! It can happen, with the left-armer's bouncer going across the right-hander, and him going hard at a ball rising above his shoulder. Not easy to get on top of it to muscle it through leg. But you do have every chance of pinging a boundary right behind you"
75,"Khaleel Ahmed to Maxwell, no run goes for the pull, but here, Khaleel is able to sneak under the bat and through to the keeper"
76,"Khaleel Ahmed to Maxwell, 1 run shortish and outside off, dabs it in front of point"
77,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run seam-up delivery, I think, on a good length on off stump. And Maxwell knocks it back to long-on"
78,"Kuldeep to Carey, 2 runs that's beautiful work from Carey. Waits for the tossed up slower ball to arrive and then hits it smoothly over the field at cover."
79,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run quicker delivery, hoping to catch the batsman cutting just because the length is short. But Carey is alive to the threat it poses to the stumps and deflects the ball to point"
80,"Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run reaches out in front of him to sweep a well tossed up delivery to deep square leg. Lovely variations in flight from Kuldeep"
81,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run tries to make room to crash the ball through the covers, but Kuldeep follows him, and bowls so very slow too, refusing an antsy batsman any pace to work with"
82,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run doesn't pick the googly this time as a good length ball on middle and leg spins away and takes the leading edge as he tries to flick it"
83,"Krunal to Maxwell, OUT taken at long-on! Maxwell clears his front leg and tries to launch the ball into orbit. And really, this ball is there to be hit, pitched short of a length and not even pretending as if it'd turn. The batsman makes room, hits as hard as he can, but he can't clear the straight field. Simple catch to Rohit, who makes up for the earlier drop"
84,"Krunal to Carey, 1 run sweeps the fuller delivery outside off to deep midwicket"
85,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run whips the flatter delivery on middle through midwicket"
86,"Krunal to Carey, FOUR runs over cover! Insane timing. Carey does nothing more than extend his hands, and a straight bat. And the full toss outside off just disappears to the boundary"
87,"Krunal to Carey, 1 run works it down to long-on, dragging it from outside off"
88,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run good length on off stump, taps to point, and runs"
89,"Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, 1 wide back of a length and strays too far outside off for the umpire's liking"
90,"Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, 1 run goes round the wicket for a length ball outside off, Lynn slides it away to deep point"
91,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, no run full on off stump, Carey dinks it down the pitch and Khaleel doesn't let it go past him on his left"
92,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, FOUR runs low full toss outside off, steers it to the boundary at cover. Simple timing again. Has a solid base. Keeps his eye on the ball. Plays as it's said in the text book"
93,"Khaleel Ahmed to Carey, 1 run hacks away a back of a length delivery from outside off to deep midwicket"
94,"Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, no run looks like the slower ball, banged into the middle of the pitch. The 118 kph delivery is pushed to extra cover"
95,"Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, 1 wide offcutter again, but in trying to play hide and seek with Lynn, he slants this ball way too wide outside off"
96,"Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, 1 run gets into the pull shot a little too early and only gets a toe-end on this short ball outside off. Good over from the left-arm quick. Excellent plan to change the pace and pull his length back against the big-hitting Lynn. Denies him that big, baseball swing"
97,"Krunal to Lynn, 2 runs full and outside off, Lynn drives to the left of long-off and pinches a second run"
98,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 wide slips down leg as Lynn misses his sweep shot, the bat coming down a little too late to catch up with the ball"
99,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run pushes the flatter delivery on leg stump to long-on"
100,"Krunal to Carey, FOUR runs beautiful shot, over cover! The left-armer coming round the wicket drifts the ball across the left-hander. And he just plants his foot forward and extends the arms. Breathtaking clarity."
101,"Krunal to Carey, FOUR runs knows the bowler will go short and wicket to wicket, so he is ready with a reverse swat, taking the ball off middle stump and smuggling it to the third man boundary"
102,"Krunal to Carey, OUT finds deep midwicket! It's the tossed up delivery. It's on middle. It's there for the sweep shot and Carey's been timing them like nobody's business. Except here, as well as he hits it, he can only find Kohli on the boundary"
103,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run nudges it through vacant square leg"
104,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run takes the pace off and pitches it short as well. Stoinis can't adjust to the lack of pace. And he doesn't have any room to free the arms. Tries to flick, but it lobs off his body towards where silly point would have been"
105,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run looks like a legcutter, which Lynn smashes it deep point. Stands tall and flat bats it with venom"
106,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run back of a length on off stump, Stoinis gets an outside edge to point"
107,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs lashes it to the point boundary. Decent plan to bowl slow at a hard-hitter of the ball. So too is the length - short on these big Aussie grounds can be useful - but there is too much room on it and Lynn takes full toll"
108,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run targets the base of off stump, Lynn skews it away for a single at long-off"
109,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run holds his shape, even though it seems like he only just picks the slower ball, and taps it to the right of Bhuvi for a single"
110,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs back of a length and outside off, Stoinis punches to the sweeper"
111,"Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT mix-up, direct hit, Lynn's gone. Oooh, this is silly, silly stuff. Stoinis starts it all by dabbing the ball gently towards point and wants a single. Lynn isn't keen on it at first but then just as he commits to it, Stoinis is haring back into his crease, leaving him no choice but to race back to the bowler's end. But Bumrah is on the balll, he takes aim and he throws down the stumps. Super stuff"
112,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run another slower ball, the offcutter kicking up off the pitch and unsettling Stoinis, who nicks the ball almost onto his stumps"
113,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run short and outside off, he slaps it to deep point"
114,"Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, 1 run nails the yorker on middle and Coulter-Nile is awake to it's considerable threat. Single towards mid-on"
115,"Bumrah to Stoinis, FOUR runs slices the full toss on and around off stump to the point boundary"
116,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs yorker on middle and leg, Coulter-Nile works it to deep midwicket"
117,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, 1 run looks for the blockhole again, Coulter-Nile hits it down the ground to long-on"
118,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run good length and outside off - but there's no pace in it. Stoinis blocks to point for a single"
119,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs legcutter flies away off the outside edge. Tiny bit of room for Coulter-Nile to free the arms and he latches onto it well enough to get four over point"
120,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, no run pin-point yorker on off stump and Coulter-Nile is only just able to dig it out"
121,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs carves the length ball to the left of long-off. Bhuvi misses his mark and Coulter-Nile clears his front leg and sends it racing away across the SCG turf, singeing the grass"
122,"Bumrah to Stoinis, FOUR runs bouncer! Hoicks it away over midwicket! And then looks at the bottom of the bat! Honestly, if it travels the distance on an Aussie ground, that bat must be magic"
123,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run sends it to long-on"
124,"Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, 1 run slower ball outside off, Coulter-Nile prepares to flat bat it over the bowler's head but the lack of pace makes him drag it to long-on"
125,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs back of a length slower ball targeting the wide line, Stoinis thumps it down the ground to long-off"
126,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs heaves the short ball out to long-on! They want a second run. It's risky. Coulter-Nile dives. Has he made it? The third umpire needs to check this Yes! He has. And it's all because of a sensational dive! Full-length. Perfectly timed. And he gets to his crease in the time it takes for Bumrah to collect the ball and break the stumps"
127,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 wide loses his shape as he goes for a slog and the dipping slower ball outside off wanders away to the keeper"
128,"Bumrah to Stoinis, FOUR runs goes for the pull, gets an inside edge, and slips away to the left of the diving fine leg fielder. Hm, 164 then, that's a pretty decent total all considered."
129,"Meanwhile, in the Pro Kabaddi League, pre-tournament favourites Bengal Warriors are in danger of missing out on the playoffs because of their shaky defence. Read more here"
130,"8.30 pm Australia's openers set up the launchpad with a fifty partnership. But then Krunal Pandya, who was hit for 12 in his first over, rallied well to finish with four wickets, the best figures by a spinner in a T20I in Australia. At that point, with the spinners going well, it seemed like Australia would struggle to put up a score, and they were also hiding Chris Lynn down the order, perhaps to prevent him from facing Kuldeep and Krunal."
131,8.40pm Here we go. The Australians are about to head out onto the ground. Rohit and Shikhar won't be far behind. Rohit Sharma will face the first ball from Mitchell Starc.
132,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, 1 run 142kph, good length, hint of swing in to off, runs off the edge along the ground to third man"

135,"Starc to Rohit Sharma, 1 run 146kph, inswinging yorker, he jams the bat down and squeezes it behind square, just got the bat down in time!"
136,"Starc to S Dhawan, no run 142kph, bouncer, this flies very high, Dhawan sways under, it's not called wide"

148,"Starc to S Dhawan, no run 145kph, tailing into the pads, full, he misses out trying to whip it away, it was going way down leg so no shout for LBW"

150,"Starc to S Dhawan, FOUR runs cracking off drive! This was a half-volley and he leaned into the drive and placed it perfectly past mid off"
151,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide angled down the leg side and rightly called wide"

That strike helped his team-mates settle down and take the game deep. In the end though, as disc"
