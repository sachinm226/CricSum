276,"Taylor to Johnson, no run outside off, moving further away and there's no need for Johnson to play, so he doesn't"
277,"Taylor to Johnson, OUT great ball, an awkward one for a lower-order player like Johnson. Taylor squeezed him up with a shortish ball aimed at the ribs, Johnson tried to work it to square leg but a leading edge flew to Benn in the gully."
278,"Edwards to Lee, no run good short ball, right over the stumps and not too high, Lee sways out of the way of one that was about at neck height"
279,"Edwards to Lee, no run similar again, a touch shorter and swinging in a fraction as well, but Lee gets out of the way once more"
280,"Edwards to Lee, no run Lee on the back foot, not surprisingly, and he defends it away"
281,"Edwards to Lee, 1 wide short again, but over the head of Lee this time and Aleem Dar gives Edwards the signal that he's had enough bouncers at Lee this over"

291,"Edwards to Clark, OUT great ball! Inswinger takes Clark's off stump out of the ground and that's Australia's innings over"
292,"So a great effort from West Indies this morning, so often their lower order rally but not this time, Edwards bowled fast and with some super late swing, Taylor was also good and now it'll be up to Lee, Clark and Johnson to see what they can do on this pitch."
293,"""How's crowd? Any sign of calypso band playing yet?..."" ask Samarth. Its pretty calm actually, not much music. A few clouds hang overhead, getting dark on one side of the ground however, not to far away."

303,"Clark to Marshall, no run on middle and leg, sliding down, defended to Jaques"
304,"Clark to Marshall, FOUR runs sucks him onto the front foot, defending with hard hands, and the edge flies down to where third slip just was and it runs to third man, taking Marshall into double figures"

310,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run again down leg stump and its helped down to fine leg"
311,"Johnson to Marshall, 2 runs another full delivery, another pleasing off-drive, but a poor piece of fielding from Lee at mid-off, getting down but not closing his legs and allowing runs for free"
312,"Johnson to Marshall, FOUR runs there's a shot! Marshall looks to be positive, using his feet to punch a marginally straighter delivery back past the stumps and Sarwan, hit uppishly but safely"
313,"Clark to Sarwan, OUT well held, Hussey! Clark gets into the action, serving up on a length and forcing Sarwan to square-drive on the up when not to the pitch and the failure to keep it down results in a super athletic catch at backward point, Hussey flinging h"

331,"Clark to Marshall, no run gets back and across and defends a shorter ball to midwicket"
