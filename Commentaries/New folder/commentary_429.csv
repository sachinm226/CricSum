0,"Woakes to Warner, no run Full and flat, a low full-toss outside off. Clubbed back to the bowler"
1,"Woakes to Warner, no run a touch of width outside off, and a good connection from Warner, but good cover at extra cover."
2,"Woakes to Warner, no run belted across the line, another fine connection, and an even better tumbling stop at mid-on"
3,"Woakes to Warner, 1 run slower ball, patted into a gap at short cover, and Warner is away"
4,"Woakes to Watson, 1 run well struck, into the gap at cover, and they jog through for another single"
5,"Woakes to Warner, no run a swing and a miss, good line and length from Woakes, and that's a very tidy first over"
6,"Shahzad to Watson, no run a flowing drive, into the covers, but straight at the field. England have got their options covered so far"
7,"Shahzad to Watson, no run good delivery, just threatened to ghost away at the last minute, and Watson leaves his bat hanging limply as the ball skids by"
8,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run blocked out to point with a full stride. Another single as Collingwood rushes in"
9,"Shahzad to Warner, 2 runs a steepling chance! Way, way up into the air, and if this was the Telstra Dome, or whatever it's now called, that would have hit the roof. Right underneath the ball with that shot, but Bresnan at mid-on never looked like getting clos"
10,"Shahzad to Warner, 2 runs on the hips, tucked away fine"
11,"Shahzad to Warner, FOUR runs on the pads, and that's Australia's first boundary. Shahzad speared the ball wide, but Warner was alert to it and made good contact. The outfield can't deny him either"
12,"Woakes to Watson, SIX runs effortless, flowing strike. Full and straight, and Watson puts his full body weight through that lofted drive. Straight as you like, over the rope"
13,"Woakes to Watson, 1 run open face, steered down to third man"

15,"Woakes to Warner, 1 run punched into the covers off the back foot"
16,"Woakes to Watson, 1 run a sliced slap, down towards third man, but it drops just short of Luke Wright ..."
17,"Woakes to Warner, FOUR runs opens the stance, and that's a quality punched drive, up and over mid-on, and rocketing to the fence before the sweeper can intercept. A fine over for Australia"
18,"Shahzad to Watson, SIX runs what a strike! On the toes, a lofted flick and that travels way over the head of deep midwicket. 89 metres, apparently, and bouncing off the boundary boards"

20,"Shahzad to Warner, no run driven again, into the covers"
21,"Shahzad to Warner, no run slower ball, well disguised, and Warner's attempted swipe is mistimed out to short cover"
22,"Shahzad to Warner, FOUR runs bouncer, pretty well directed to be honest, but Warner was equal to it, helping round the corner and one bounce over the rope at fine leg"
23,"Shahzad to Warner, no run right up in the blockhole, and punched to mid-off to finish"
24,"Woakes to Watson, OUT crucial breakthrough. Full length again from Woakes, a flick across the line from Watson, but Morgan at deep square leg is in place to take the catch"
25,"Woakes to Warner, 1 wide down the leg-side"
26,"Woakes to Warner, 1 run squared up a fraction by a shorter ball. Defended out to the leg side"
27,"Woakes to Paine, no run good line and length, defended on off stump by the new batsman"
28,"Woakes to Paine, SIX runs mowed across the line. Not middled at all, but the bottom of the bat has enough meat to clear the long-on rope"
29,"Woakes to Paine, 2 runs slower ball again, dragged through midwicket"
30,"Woakes to Paine, 2 runs low full-toss, picks the gap at midwicket, and another more-than-decent over in the end for Australia"
31,"Bresnan to Warner, 1 run short and pulled calmly through midwicket"
32,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run chopped out to point, and a bit of a scamper to make the non-striker's end"
33,"Bresnan to Warner, 1 run clipped out to midwicket"
34,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs too short, and launched over point with an aggressive uppercut"
35,"Bresnan to Paine, no run slower ball, a violent swing and a miss. The ball trickles past the leg stump, but Paine had made room so no wide"
36,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run excellent delivery, right into the blockhole, and punched into the covers"
37,"Swann to Paine, no run reverse sweep to start, but no connection"
38,"Swann to Paine, FOUR runs uses the feet well, and lofted handsomely over wide mid-on. The ball hits the rope as it lands"
39,"Swann to Paine, 1 run a touch early on that stroke, and chipped in the air through midwicket. But safe"
40,"Swann to Warner, 1 run round the wicket, and pushed off the back foot through extra cover"
41,"Swann to Paine, OUT a swipe across the line, a massive steepler, Collingwood calls for it at short midwicket, steadies himself, fumbles the initial take, but clutches onto the rebound!"
42,"Swann to Warner, no run driven firmly but straight to short cover."
43,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run steered out to point, off the back foot"
44,"Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run on the back foot, tapped to cover, and a quick single. Collingwood's shy hits the stumps, but he's home. Smart work though"
45,"Bresnan to Warner, 3 runs heaved square, ungainly but effective, but good work on the rope from Morgan to save a single"
46,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run lifter, very straight, and Hussey tries to loft that over the keeper's head, but can't make contact"
47,"Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run chopped down to third man"
48,"Bresnan to Warner, 1 run low full toss, pumped down the ground to mid-off. Good over from Bresnan"

53,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run weaved out to point with busy footwork."
54,"Swann to Warner, 1 run dabbed in the air, dangerously close to Shahzad at short third man, who fields with a juggle on the bounce"
55,"Yardy to Warner, no run Warner was looking for a leg-side wide there, but he accidentally got his pad in the way"
56,"Yardy to Warner, OUT tame end for Warner as he plays an unbalanced sliced loft down the ground, which Pietersen intercepts on the boundary's edge. Vital strike again from England, who are battling back now"
57,"Yardy to Hussey, no run attempted swish back past the bowler, but Yardy pounces in his followthrough"
58,"Yardy to Hussey, no run good flight, and White is beaten off the pitch"
59,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run stabbed into space at mid-on, off the back foot"
60,"Yardy to White, no run calm work from Yardy. A good length tweaker that White can only defend with a vertical bat"
61,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run a bit of width, but Swann is bowling to his field as a cut shot is slapped towards deep third man"
62,"Swann to White, OUT cracking delivery, genuine spin as White, the Victorian, is nailed on the back foot. Paul Reiffel, the umpire - another Victorian - sticks up the finger!"
63,"Swann to Finch, 2 runs outside edge, poked through the gully region. That'll do"
64,"Swann to Finch, no run turned off the toes to square leg"
65,"Swann to Finch, no run another flick, but straight to midwicket. England are keeping things tight now"
66,"Swann to Finch, no run more sharp spin from an off-stump line. This is Test-match bowling from Swann"

70,"Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs on the toes, flicked out to deep midwicket"
71,"Yardy to Hussey, OUT short this time, but it's a rare bad ball that is too eagerly accepted by Hussey. A greedy slap to deep midwicket, where Woakes makes no mistake!"
72,"Yardy to Smith, no run good turn on a middle-stump line. Australia haven't scored a boundary for nearly six overs"
73,"Swann to Finch, 2 runs waist-high full toss as Swann lets one slip with an aghast scream. But it's not costly"
74,"Swann to Finch, FOUR runs and there's the elusive boundary, a well-judged sweep through backward square"
75,"Swann to Finch, 1 run heaved into the leg-side"
76,"Swann to Smith, no run down on the sweep, but can't make proper contact"
77,"Swann to Smith, no run two strides down the wicket, and defended back to the bowler"
78,"Swann to Smith, no run another sharp offspinner to complete a fine spell from Swann. Smith tries to sweep but gets in a tangle"
79,"Yardy to Finch, 1 run wide and walloped, out to deep point"
80,"Yardy to Smith, 2 runs worked into space at deep midwicket, good running brings two as the shy comes in"

82,"Yardy to Finch, 1 run outside off, pushed out to deep cover"
83,"Yardy to Smith, 2 runs excellent running makes two from nothing as a push to mid-on finds the smallest of gaps, beyond Yardy's reach, and short of the in-rushing KP"
84,"Yardy to Smith, 1 run Smith keeps the strike as Australia prepare for their final onslaught."
85,"Pietersen to Smith, 1 run short, ballooning first delivery, but the ball takes an age to reach Smith's swipe. Which, of course, is the entire point"
86,"Pietersen to Finch, no run driven down to the covers"
87,"Pietersen to Finch, no run proper spin from Pietersen as Finch advances"

93,"Yardy to Finch, 1 run leg stump line again, backward square tidies up"
94,"Yardy to Smith, 1 run open-faced drive, out to extra cover"
95,"Yardy to Finch, 1 run very full length, dug out of the blockhole, fielded at mid-on"
96,"Yardy to Smith, no run heroic mow to a wide delivery, but that one eludes the bat. Yardy finishes with the second 4-0-19-2 analysis of the evening. Top drawer"
97,"Pietersen to Finch, SIX runs belted! in the slot, and clean over mid-off!"
98,"Pietersen to Finch, no run cracking delivery! A lifter on off stump, and beats the bat"
99,"Pietersen to Finch, no run very wide, left alone, but it's just inside the tramlines"
100,"Pietersen to Finch, no run a mow, but no contact"
101,"Pietersen to Finch, FOUR runs cracked hard, up and over the covers. Excellent shot"
102,"Pietersen to Finch, no run dot ball to finish. Not a bad recovery from KP in that over"
103,"Bresnan to Smith, 1 run slower ball, there might be a few of those. Full and straight and worked to mid-on"
104,"Bresnan to Finch, 1 run attempted yorker, tailing in from outside off, good delivery and even better fielding as Shahzad saves a certain four with a full-length dive at short third man"
105,"Bresnan to Smith, 1 run a leg-side waft, and Bell at short midwicket pounces to save the boundary. Sharp fielding as ever"
106,"Bresnan to Finch, 1 leg bye slower-ball bouncer, and Finch top-edges that straight into his face! Lucky he's got a lid on ... good ball"
107,"Bresnan to Smith, 1 run another slower ball, guided straight to point"
108,"Bresnan to Finch, 1 leg bye and another slower ball, another mow across the line, and a scrambled single as the shy comes in"
109,"Shahzad to Finch, FOUR runs cracking strike. Anticipating pace, and turned his stance inside-out to lift the ball Dilshan-style over fine leg!"
110,"Shahzad to Finch, 3 runs bouncer, Finch charges down the track, top-edges a pull, which plugs at deep square leg! it's all happening, but these runs are vital"
111,"Shahzad to Smith, no run slow, slow, slow, bouncer, tennis-ball smash, straight back to the bowler. That was a genuine leg-break!"
112,"Shahzad to Smith, OUT another slower ball, a cutter this time, another smash, and short cover crouches to intercept."
113,"Shahzad to O'Keefe, 1 run another slower ball, Collingwood tried to swoop at short cover, but the run was always on"
114,"Shahzad to Finch, SIX runs another legbreak, too short, and that is belted across the line. Bresnan, the man in the deep, flails hopefully, but can't intercept! Valuable blow"
115,"Bresnan to O'Keefe, OUT what on earth happened there? Ah, O'Keefe was bowled, that's what. An attempted Dilscoop, but he just ends up looking like a Dil, as his leg bail is removed by a length ball"
116,"Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run in the blockhole, flicked uppishly to deep square leg"
117,"Bresnan to Finch, 2 runs waist-high full toss, clubbed out to midwicket, and they dash back for two. Bell's shy comes in on the bounce, which loses valuable seconds"
118,"Bresnan to Finch, 2 runs another bosh across the line, picks the gap well, as two men converge to save the boundary"
119,"Bresnan to Finch, 2 runs slower ball again, and that is a precious maiden fifty for the 24-year-old Victorian, Aaron Finch. Bill Lawry would be doing handstands, no doubt"
120,"Bresnan to Finch, 2 runs smacked out to deep long on. Well played Finch, he's kept Australia afloat. England will need 148 to win. Exactly what they chased at Bridgetown in May, as it happens."
121,"So, an excellent recovery from England's bowlers, with the spinners and slower balls to the fore. A pair of excellent analyses for Yardy and Swann, 2 for 19 each, and a fine fifty from Finch. Back in a bit, when Sahil Dutta will take over the comms. Don't stray too"
122,"Evening all, Sahil here. Pace off the ball was the key for England. Shaun Tait, Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson are Australia's muscle. Makes a good contest with England's pair of stylists at the top of the order - Ian Bell and Steve Davies. Cameron White leads out"
123,"Tait to Bell, no run good start from Tait, short and zippy, Bell stands on his toes to defend in a hurry"
124,"Tait to Bell, FOUR runs oh no, don't bowl there. Short and wide at any pace gets a bowler into trouble. Bell rocks back and stylishly cuts past point for four"
125,"Tait to Bell, no run good comeback, fuller and faster. Bell was stuck in the crease as he steered a block to point"
126,"Tait to Bell, FOUR runs swing on the ball! Late from a full length, swing of the bat as well though as Bell unfurled his picture-perfect cover drive, threading through the infield for another boundary"
127,"Tait to Bell, no run Bell tip-toes down the wicket and aims a whoosh outside off stump. Doesn't connect"
128,"Tait to Bell, 3 runs slower ball from Tait, there might need to be a few more of them. Bell sees it early and flicks it away through midwicket for three"
129,"Lee to Bell, no run starts full around off stump and Bell pings a Watson-esque drive straight to mid-off"
130,"Lee to Bell, 1 run Lee straight into 90mph and a single worked to a big gap at midwicket gives Davies the strike for the first time"
131,"Lee to Davies, no run Lee hits a decent length and line outside off stump and Davies stands still to prod to point"
132,"Lee to Davies, 1 run shorter this time, doesn't want to give Davies anything to drive. For those of you who haven't seen Davies he's got shades of Ganguly in his off-side shots. This is steered to point for a swiftly-taken single"
133,"Lee to Bell, no run Bell edges down the wicket and Lee responds by banging it in. The line is excellent though and Bell can only defend"
134,"Lee to Bell, no run excellent over from Lee. Really top stuff finishes with a sharp short ball that Bell hops to defend. Lee rewards himself by following through a long way down to Bell and... winking at him. He just doesn't know how to be mean."
135,"Tait to Davies, 1 run Davies didn't know much about this, he popped forward to find the ball rushing onto his bat and bobbling away. Bell called him through for a single"
136,"Tait to Bell, no run good straight line from Tait, no width for Bell to flay at. Punched without much timing to mid-on"
137,"Tait to Bell, no run there is some width here which Bell duly does flay at. Zipped through and climbed to Paine as Bell found fresh air"
138,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs massive yelp from Tait as he delivered his sling here. Bell mistimed a leg-side nudge, which earned him a couple"
139,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs short ball and Bell is in position to pull very early, didn't quite time it though as it trickled off the toe end towards midwicket"
140,"Tait to Bell, (no ball) 2 runs no ball which means it's free hit time. Full and angling towards the legs, Bell happily flicked for a couple more"
141,"Tait to Bell, 1 run ideal delivery for the free hit really. Full and straight and driven to mid-off. The free hit always ends as an anti-climax it seems"
142,"Lee to Bell, 1 run Lee has not offered anything for Bell to get hold of. Bell tries to manufacture some width by jumping leg side of the ball, but only manages to outside-edge to third man"
143,"Lee to Davies, 1 run very short to Davies again. They won't let him drive, so he steers a very cautious hook shot to fine leg to give Bell back the strike. Again"
144,"Lee to Bell, 3 runs just about enough width, made wider with Bell skipping leg side, for Bell to scythe a drive through cover. The damp outfield means he only collects three"
145,"Lee to Davies, (no ball) bouncer to Davies again. Good one too, slower ball that completely deceived Davies. But.. because of the bouncer earlier in the over it's been called a no ball. Lee is unimpressed"
146,"Lee to Davies, no run this has to be fuller, but the line - hugging off stump - is good and Davies can't get away"
147,"Lee to Davies, 1 run banged in short again and Davies is struggling a touch. Mistimes a pull shot that loops gently into space at square leg"
148,"Lee to Bell, 1 run back of a length, good stuff from Lee. Bell pinches the strike again by mistiming a pull shot"
149,"Watson to Bell, no run starts full and straight and Bell toe-ends a drive back to the bowler"
150,"Watson to Bell, 2 runs Bell hops down the wicket and Watson responds by shoving it in short. Odd shot in the end. Flat-bat tennis swat that is timed well enough for Bell to pick up a couple down the ground"
151,"Watson to Bell, 1 run down the wicket again and Bell's off-side hack trickles towards cover"
152,"Watson to Davies, FOUR runs Watson's short ball at Davies is not sharp enough and with fine leg up Davies pulls powerfully for four"
153,"Watson to Davies, no run not a great shot this. Davies wafts aimlessly outside off and luckily for him, missed it"
154,"Watson to Davies, 2 runs Davies is hanging back and desperate for some width outside off, doesn't get it and has to hack to leg"
155,"Johnson to Bell, 1 wide ooops, bad Mitch to start. Really bad. Slung six metres wide of off stump"
156,"Johnson to Bell, no run follows up with a straighter ball that Bell murders to mid-off. Just like Watson, that."
157,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run short and sharp, Bell hurries into a pull shot that he doesn't quite get hold of"
158,"Johnson to Davies, 1 run Davies just cannot get away. He gets a delivery tight on off stump and can only drop it towards cover for a well-taken single"
159,"Johnson to Bell, 2 runs for the first time in about a year, Bell is struggling for timing. He aims a booming drive here and it skews away past mid-off for a couple"
160,"Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs short ball that Bell got deep into his crease and had an absolute muller at. No finesse, but strong enough hack to leg to carry it over the rope"
161,"Johnson to Bell, 2 runs no timing again, but skewed past point for a couple more to bring up the fifty stand"
162,"Hussey to Davies, no run starts well and it sticks in the pitch, Davies steers to point"
163,"Hussey to Davies, 2 runs touch shorter and Davies gets hold of a firm pull shot that should have been four until some remarkable sliding fielding from Smith saves on the midwicket rope"
164,"Hussey to Davies, 1 run fetched into the leg side for another single"
165,"Hussey to Bell, 1 run Bell down the wicket and pushing this right-arm dart to long-off"
166,"Hussey to Davies, 2 runs Davies jumps outside leg and gives himself room to drive, airily through cover for a couple"
167,"Hussey to Davies, 2 runs shoved into the leg side again, dragged really. No great timing but enough to earn a couple more"
168,"Johnson to Bell, 2 runs Bell dances down the wicket which forces Johnson short, pulled firmly in front of midwicket for two more"
169,"Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run flicked off the hip with a snap of the wrists to get away straight away"
170,"Johnson to Davies, 1 run slung full and into Davies' pads, he clips neatly away to deep midwicket"
171,"Johnson to Pietersen, OUT Cheers and boos ring loud as Pietersen falls! Johnson dished up a full drive-me ball that Pietersen climbed into, only to pick out White at cover who held an excellent low catch"
172,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood pushes his first ball wide of cover to get him off the mark. Just needs to steady England for a few overs"
173,"O'Keefe to PD Collingwood, 2 runs starts by tossing one up towards the pads, Collingwood is the master of nurdle and it gets him two to midwicket"
174,"O'Keefe to PD Collingwood, 1 run enough width for Collingwood to clunk an inelegant drive to deep point"
175,"O'Keefe to Davies, FOUR runs ah, lovely shot. Ganguly-esque again from Davies as he clears his front leg to a left-arm spinner and eases a swing to wide long-on for four"
176,"O'Keefe to Davies, 1 run tries to repeat the shot, but without any of the timing so it only earns a single"
177,"O'Keefe to PD Collingwood, no run beaten outside off stump! Spin for O'Keefe"
178,"O'Keefe to PD Collingwood, 1 run this time Collingwood uses his feet, shuffling down to push a single to long-off"
179,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run good start to the new spell, back of a length around off stump, Collingwood pushes firmly to cover"
180,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run shortish again and Collingwood steers to point. Two dots"
181,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run Watson joining the dots and building pressure here. Collingwood struggling to find his range"
182,"Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run finally he gets off strike, poking a single towards mid-on"
183,"Watson to Davies, 1 run Davies flicks to leg in search of two, but square leg races in from the boundary to keep it to one"
184,"Watson to PD Collingwood, OUT Collingwood's difficult run continues. Watson aimed full and Collingwood tried to clear mid-off with a drive. The timing is not there though and it goes gently to mid-off who jumps to take the chance above his head"
185,"Hussey to Morgan, 1 run drive his first ball firmly to short-cover who fumbles and allows a single"
186,"Hussey to Davies, 1 run Davies aims a drive as well, without quite timing it, wide of cover"
187,"Hussey to Morgan, no run very correct forward defence here. Good work from Hussey"

189,"Hussey to Davies, 1 run good over this, Davies whips a single towards midwicket"
190,"Hussey to Morgan, 1 run the middle overs proving difficult for England, just as they did for Australia. Morgan only managing a single wide of mid-off"

192,"Watson to Morgan, no run Morgan remains pinned to the crease in defence"
193,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run after seeing a couple Morgan is happy to drill a drive back at the bowler, some very smart fielding from Warner at mid-on saves a boundary"
194,"Watson to Davies, 1 run Davies, who has hardly had any strike, wanders over to the off side and whips a single into the square-leg region"
195,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run just short enough for Watson to chop down to third man but it's still just a single"
196,"Watson to Davies, no run good slower ball deceives Davies who gave himself room to cut, but couldn't wait on it long enough. Just three from the over and Australia are right in this"
197,"Johnson to Morgan, no run touch of width but Morgan's cut finds point"
198,"Johnson to Morgan, FOUR runs valuable, pressure-easing boundary. Johnson misses his line and it's nudged down to the fine leg boundary"
199,"Johnson to Morgan, no run back on it now from Johnson and Morgan has to hurry to defend"
200,"Johnson to Morgan, no run back of a length here and Morgan can only stand up on his toes to defend"
201,"Johnson to Morgan, 1 run shout of catch and Morgan flicks uppishly through midwicket"

213,"Hussey to Wright, no run beaten outside off stump to finish the over"
214,"Lee to Morgan, no run bit of width first up and Morgan's chops without much timing to point"
215,"Lee to Morgan, 1 run ooh, nervy times for Morgan. Aims a big pull shot but gets a toe-end that loops straight for a single"
216,"Lee to Wright, 2 runs Wright again cuts, bat and arms a whirr, scampers a couple"
217,"Lee to Wright, 1 run banged in short and Wright aims a big hook shot, eyes off the ball, no timing and it bobbles to fine leg"
218,"Lee to Morgan, 1 run 21 balls since the last boundary as Morgan's cut shot finds deep point"

222,"Tait to Wright, 2 runs Tait aims down the leg side and Wright thinks he flick has four, it doesn't thanks to some excellent fielding on the rope"
223,"Tait to Bresnan, 1 run very sharp and a good line from Tait, Bresnan stays leg side of the ball to poke a single"
224,"Tait to Morgan, no run swing and a miss outside off stump! Morgan hasn't found his range and that's why England are struggling. Australia in the box seat now!"
225,"Johnson to Bresnan, 1 run chaos! Which only earns a single after all that. Bresnan smacked a drive to mid-off. Morgan had set off for a single but Bresnan didn't move. The throw came in, missed the stumps and ran away for an over throw"
