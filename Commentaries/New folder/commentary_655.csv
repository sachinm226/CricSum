96,"Pathan to Clarke, 1 wide, OUT got 'em! Great work by Dhoni behind the stumps. That was a poor ball down leg side but Clarke can't get hold of the flick and over-balances after the stroke.

115,"Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run"
116,"Harbhajan to Symonds, 2 runs Symonds charges down the ground again and lofts over extra cover. Doesn't get the timing right and they manage a couple. These two are so powerful that under-edges usually go for six but they're yet to get into full flow."

118,"Pathan to Hayden, no run"
119,"Pathan to Hayden, 1 run"
120,"Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs short of a length and outside off, Symonds gets a thickish edge that races away to third man for four. Not in control but runs are runs. Pathan smiles that cherubic smile."

122,"Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs This one is deliberate. On middle and off and Symonds opens the face of the bat and glides it to third man for another four. Words exchanged but that was really well played. A big man luke Symonds can do cute bits too"
123,"Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs And that's brutal. Two cute glides followed by a rapacious slap. Too short, too wide and Symonds isn't going to miss out on that one. Creams it past cover for four. Pathan finally stops smiling. It's been that kind of over"
124,"Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run Hayden tries to open up his shoulders now. These two complement each other well. Uppish cut but it's short of the fielder at point. They scramble a single"
125,"Harbhajan to Symonds, SIX runs Crack! Down the pitch he comes and pulps that over deep long-on for a big one. Symonds not looking back anymore. These are meaty blows. Bring on the wild pigs, he seems to be saying"

136,"Powar to Symonds, SIX runs Bang! Another slower one but this time Symonds decides enough is enough. Down the ground and scooped way over midwicket for a big one. He's launching the assault now. And it's just the 22nd over."
137,"Harbhajan to Hayden, no run Hayden edges to the off side but doesn't want the single. Symonds is halfway down the pitch and slips slightly too but Uthappa juggles and doesn't get the throw in time. Opportunity squandered for India"

139,"Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run firm drive to long-on"
140,"Harbhajan to Hayden, no run bit of extra bounce for Harbhajan, defended cautiously down the ground. It's obvious that Hayden is biding his time and Symonds is going for it"

146,"Powar to Hayden, FOUR runs tossed up on legstump and Hayden smacks his lips, gets on his haunches and sweeps savagely to fine leg for a four. Suddenly batting looks much easier than earlier"
147,"Powar to Hayden, no run big appeal but that was likely to miss the off stump. Powar is bowling over the wicket but that pitched on line. Problem was it was turning away and would have missed off. Hayden can't make contact while sweeping but he was safe that time"
148,"Powar to Hayden, 1 run"
149,"Harbhajan to Hayden, SIX runs That's a screamer. Hayden simply gets down on his haunches and whistles that over midwicket for a big six. Harbhajan isn't saying much now. Hayden in such form is best left alone. And by the way he's brought up his fifty. Raises the bat as if to say, 'Now that's just the first cou"
150,"Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run Tapped away for a single. It's amazing how often the Aussies take a single after they've managed a boundary"

159,"Powar to Symonds, 1 run better line it seems, Symonds down the track but can only manage a single."
160,"Powar to Hayden, no run that's really well bowled. Sees Hayden showing signs of coming down the track and pushes it through faster. Hayden changes his mind and tries to glide it to third man but is beaten."

248,"Khan to Symonds, no run short of a length and outside off, ball stopping on Symonds and he tries to cut it away but can't get the timing right. Inside edge could have gone on to the stumps but goes to Dhoni"
249,"Khan to Symonds, 2 runs clattered away with a horizontal bat down the ground, racing away four four but stopped well for Gambhir at long-on"
250,"Khan to Symonds, 1 run glided away to third man for a single"
251,"Khan to Haddin, 1 run outside off and angled away to third man, there's a fielder inside the circle but it beats him. Simple single there"
252,"Khan to Symonds, no run holds it back a bit and short of a length. Ball stopping on the batsmen a bit now. Symonds tries to cut but can't make contact. Sign of a two-paced pitch for the second innings?"

254,"Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run low full toss, bunted away wide of long-off for a single"

257,"Harbhajan to Haddin, FOUR runs attempted leg-stump yorker but Haddin is quick to pounce on it, glancing it fine, past Dhoni and past short fine leg for four. It was a really quick one and ran away to the fence"

263,"Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run another slower one, legcutter again, pushed away to the leg side. Sreesanth has a word with Symonds. It turns into several words. Symonds reponds. A smile is exchanged."
264,"Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run pushed to long-off efficiently"
265,"Khan to Haddin, 1 run yorker from Zaheer, Hadden is forced to dig it out towards the off side, that's the length India need at the moment."
266,"Khan to Symonds, 1 run Symonds backs away and charges too, blasted away to long-off but straight to the fielder. Australia will look to launch towards 300 now."
267,"Khan to Haddin, 1 run Good ball again, over the wicket and yorker length again. Haddin seems comfortable taking the single and handing over strike to Symonds."
268,"Khan to Symonds, FOUR runs Full pitched ball outside off, sliced away by Symonds, past point and wide of third man for a four. This man is dangerous in these phases. Pumping iron almost"
269,"Khan to Symonds, FOUR runs full length ball but that was creamed away with immense power, down the ground past the bowler for another four. He didn't middle it really but when has that ever been the criterion in the modern age? Bring on those heavy bats"
270,"Khan to Symonds, 1 run Down the ground again but settles for the single. Keeps the strike."
271,"Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run full one from Sreesanth, driven powerfully by Symonds, through extra cover for a single. They look for two but the fielder is alert enough to get the throw back in fast"
272,"Sreesanth to Haddin, FOUR runs Too easy, full and straight and Haddin goes straight, on the back foot and thumping down the ground for a superb four. He's negating all the swing by standing outside the crease. Actually the only swing present there concerns the bat."
273,"Sreesanth to Haddin, no run Slower ball that Haddin tries to pull, misses completely and Sreesanth runs up to field the ball. A few words exchanged and there's more drama here. Sreesanth appeals to the umpire (one thinks for running out Symonds at the non-striker's end) and there are a few words exchanged with"
274,"Sreesanth to Haddin, 2 runs"

284,"Sreesanth to Haddin, no run Another slower ball, Sreesanth doing this well, Haddin lines up for a mighty heave-ho over midwicket but is too early on the shot, that nearly went onto the stumps"

287,"Sreesanth to Symonds, OUT another slower one and this time he strikes. It's full on leg stump and Symonds tries to smack it over midwicket, only manages to get a leading edge that balloons up high in the air. Sreesanth gets himself under it and completes a smart catch. Sreesanth celebrates with a leer, Symonds"

291,"Yuvraj to Haddin, no run"
292,"Yuvraj to Haddin, FOUR runs some turn for Yuvraj there, Haddin gets a thick edge past the keeper for four, Yuvraj beat him with spin there but you expect this in the final stages of a one-dayer"
293,"Yuvraj to Haddin, 2 runs slower this time and Haddin tries to pull, under-edge this time and past the keeper for two. Outside edge done, inside edge done, what ya got left?"
294,"Yuvraj to Haddin, 1 run Reverse-sweep comes out. He can't get the placement, though, and smacks it straight to short third man (or short fine leg if you prefer)"
295,"Khan to Haddin, 1 run slow ball for Zaheer, cut away to point for a single. He's done a fine job towards the end here"
296,"Khan to Hopes, 1 run backs away and tries to slog it but can't get hold of a low full toss, skied to long-off and it drops short of the fielder"
297,"Khan to Haddin, FOUR runs full toss this time and Haddin smacks it down the ground for a four. Two fielders converge, one dives but it doesn't matter."
298,"Khan to Haddin, SIX runs Slow ball after slow ball and one's going to go outside the ground. Haddin middles that and deposits it miles over midwicket. It's cleared many stands. Scattered the crowd even."
299,"Khan to Haddin, 1 wide too far outside off and Haddin, trying to swish it to the leg side, can afford to miss it. It's called wide"
300,"Khan to Haddin, no run"
301,"Khan to Haddin, FOUR runs That's as cute as it gets. Twenty20 stuff from Haddin. Full toss on middle from Zaheer and Haddin moves across and scoops it past fine leg. He gets hold of it and it races away for four. Premidated and efficient. Haddin hurting India here"

303,"Sreesanth to Hopes, OUT slower ball works this time, outside off and Hopes slashes wildly, straight to Dravid at extra cover. High Hopes crash. Local boy Sreesanth has three wickets now. His aim was to get five. He has four balls left to achieve it."

309,Join us in a while for the second innings. Kanishkaa will take you through the early overs of India's run-chase
310,India's bowlers threatened in phases but the Australian batting proved too strong yet again. They were done in by the rain in the first match but will hope to wrap this one up without much fuss. However India have chased 300-plus targets in the past and there is also a small matter of rain hovering around.
311,"So Australia end on an imposing 306 for 6 in their 50 overs. Like in Bangalore they recovered from a shaky start. From 8 for 2, Symonds and Hayden propped them up before Haddin provided the finishing touches with a valuable 87."
312,We're back. Brett Lee has the new ball. Gambhir will take first strike. Two slips in place
313,"Thanks Sid. India did chase over 300 in this ground, back in 2000 against South Africa, and it was a nail-biter. The pitch did appear a little two-paced so run scoring won't be very easy."

319,"Lee to Gambhir, no run appeal! full and swinging in on the pads, gambhir gets caught on the shuffle but the ball was sliding down leg"
320,"Lee to Gambhir, no run played down to the on side"
321,"Lee to Gambhir, 1 run fuller in length, aimed at the body and Gambhir shuffles and plays off the hips towards square leg"
322,"Johnson to Gambhir, no run 87.8 mph, good ball to start with, outside off, moves away just a touch, Gambhir goes back and turns it to the on side"
323,"Johnson to Gambhir, no run outside off, no room to cut, Gambhir plays a confident backward defensive stroke"
324,"Johnson to Gambhir, no run varies his length with a yorker length aimed outside off, turns into a low full toss, driven to mid-on off the toe edge of the bat"
325,"Johnson to Gambhir, 2 runs short and pulled, not quite well timed as the ball lands just past the circle at midwicket, risky stroke"

328,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run banged in outside off, Tendulkar does well to let it go"

333,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run pushed to the off side"
334,"Johnson to Uthappa, 4 runs oopsy! bad bounce for Johnson and Gilchrist as the ball beats the batsmen on the low bounce and well, misses everybody"

337,"Johnson to Uthappa, no run left alone outside the off stump"

345,"Lee to Uthappa, FOUR runs and another! this time he bisects the gap between point and cover with another square drive, he meets the pitch of the ball with a big stride forward, this was also uppish though safe"

347,"Johnson to Tendulkar, no run slower ball outside off, gets forward and pushes it off an open face to point"
348,"Johnson to Tendulkar, 1 wide bouncer! too high and more than enough height for the umpire to call a wide"
349,"Johnson to Tendulkar, no run played towards gully, Uthappa set off from the other end and on being sent back was just a little too lazy in getting back. The throw just misses the stumps"
350,"Johnson to Tendulkar, no run full and drive back firmly, Johnson does well to get a hand to it"
351,"Johnson to Tendulkar, 1 run full and driven towards mid-off, not enough power in that to beat the man there, pleasing stroke all the same"
352,"Johnson to Uthappa, 1 run outside off and the outside edge goes to third man"
353,"Lee to Uthappa, SIX runs Fearlessness of youth! short of a length, Uthappa executes a flat-batted swat over long-on, the ball landed quote a few yards over the rope"

366,"Clark to Uthappa, FOUR runs full, on off and middle, Uthappa plants his front foot forward and drives it so easily past the bowler, Clark errs by bowling to Uthappa's strengths"
367,"Clark to Uthappa, 1 run full and pushed to the off side"
368,"Clark to Tendulkar, no run holds the length back, Tendulkar nudges that to the on side"

478,"Clarke to Dhoni, OUT Now that's reckless. Another wicket goes down and this time to a run-out. Dhoni worked it to the on side and thought of a single. Pathan was too far down the track when he was sent back. Hogg flung it back to the bowler, who collected and back-flicked it onto the stumps in one motion. Path"

606,"Player of the match is Brad Haddin, AUS"
