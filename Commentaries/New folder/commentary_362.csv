96,"Swann to Johnson, no run longer lean outside off blocking into the off side"
97,"Stokes to Smith, no run full length just outside off, Smith leans forward and gets a healthy edge but remarkably it falls short of Cook diving forward at first slip, would not think edges wouldn't be carrying on this deck"

England are jubilant but Bowden, this time, is unmoved, so it's review time again. The ball deflected a long way, looked like possibly a leading edge at first sight but replays prove it was just Harris' meaty thighs and no bat involved"

262,"11.57am: Now the real work starts for England. Having been held up for 40 minutes by the last pair, they will consider that another unsatisfactory passage; but the ease with which even Lyon managed to stroke a few handy runs should encourage England's batsmen too. They'll get half an hour before lunch, on a quick, flat pitch with a lightning outfield. This is England's series right now and Alastair Cook needs a few brave bulging buoyant clairvoyants centurions to step up from within the ranks. I'll be back"

268,"Watson to Root, OUT beats the bat again, a subtle curve away from Root as he plays forward ... Australia go up in unison and after a moment's thought, Erasmus gives it. Root, however, goes straight to the DRS, he seems certain he didn't hit it. We're getting numerous replays, can't see a mark on Hot Spot, no visible deviation. Real-Time Snicko doesn't prove anything either, though there is a sound, apparently after the ball had passed the bat. Tony Hill appears to be telling Erasmus he can't be cert"

608,Innings Start
609,"Andrew: ""Really, this is the best batting I have seen from England in this series. They have looked really fragile when they have just been defending. KP, Bell, and Stokes look much better when they are scoring runs. If only they could do this in their first innings."""
