34,Shane Bond is the obvious choice for the Man of the Match. He bowled superbly right through and returned figures of 5 for 23. I've enjoyed bringing today's game to you. Keep a watch on Cricinfo for updates on Oram's finger. Thank you for all your emails and do join us on Sunday for the second ODI at Auckland. This is
