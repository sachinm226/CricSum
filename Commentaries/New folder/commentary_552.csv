497,"Australia have proven deserved winners after three consecutive wins while the promise shown by Pakistan, under adversity, in their victory in the first game, sadly for them, didn't reach its desired end. We'll get you the details from the presentation shortly."
498,"Watson was a bit of contrast, particularly against spin, missing attempted pulls and cuts on numerous occasions but the presence of Clarke helped him, and he too gradually began to open up, getting periodic boundaries to ensure the Pakistanis could never sense a chance."
499,"Clarke was rarely beaten early in his innings, and was particularly brilliant against spinners against whom he used his feet superbly. He charged down the track to anything that was pitched up, and nudged, tickled and dabbed his way to a determined century."
500,"Australia were under pressure, down two wickets for just three runs. But Clarke and co were determined to finish the series off here, after that superb comeback in the previous game where Pakistan were on top for a good part of their innings."
501,"A thumping in the end. 197 on this pitch, one felt, was still competitive but it took a lot of grit and concentration from both these batsmen to pull it off quite comfortably in the end."

503,"Player of the match is Doug Bollinger, AUS"
