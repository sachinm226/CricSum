178,"Starc to Bhuvneshwar, OUT cleaned him up! that's six! Changed the angle of delivery and came around the wicket to Bhuvi, the new batsman. It was full, it was speared in on middle.

186,"6.17 pm We've strayed a bit into the lunch break with Australia's over-rate slipping below what it should be. A few wides didn't help either. But aside from that they've done quite well against a batting line-up that loves ODIs, with the other Mitch staking his claim to be the main Mitch. But as well as Starc bowled for his 6 for 43, India haven't done too badly either. They recovered from a few"
187,"6.45pm A short break there because of the slow over rate, Australia took an extra 26 minutes to bowl their 50 overs. Finch will take strike now, Bhuvneshwar has the first new ball with two slips. Here we go..."

209,"Shami to Warner, 1 wide 143 kph, short and sliding down leg again. This time Warner is happy to collect the wide"
210,"Shami to Warner, no run much better, he needs to stick in that off-stump region. Back of a length delivery also keeps Warner honest"
211,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs one-legged pull to the square leg boundary, but this was the bowler's mistake again. Bowling short with the new ball, bowling on leg stump with the new ball. No pressure on Australia now"

213,"Shami to Warner, no run 145kph, shortish on and around off stump, defended"

215,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs back of a length, yet Finch is confidently forward and taps to mid-off, who is under pressure as Finch sets off. Direct hit would have caught him short at the non-strikers', with Finch not diving. Ends up with an overthrow"

217,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, defended carefully"

221,"Shami to Finch, no run brings Finch forward to protect his off stump. He should bowl better at the right-hander"

223,"Shami to Finch, 1 run seems to get a bit of a bottom edge to a good length ball only a shade outside off. Single to deep third man"
224,"Shami to Warner, 1 run takes on the short ball, with the field set for it! Nearly carries all the way to Akshar at deep square leg."
225,"Shami to Finch, no run 139 kph, has Finch in a spot of bother as he pings a shortish delivery down on off stump. Squares him up as the batsman uses an open face to run down to point"
226,"Shami to Finch, no run good length on off stump, Finch defends to mid-off and Shami walks back with a far better over under his belt. Had his pace up, had his radar right, just needs to reproduce it over and over and over"
227,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run firmly behind a back of a length delivery on off stump"
228,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run opens the face against a shortish ball and slices it to deep point"

230,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run oof, did the ball clip off stump?! Or did it take the bottom of the bat? Definitely hit the bottom of the bat and it veers back towards the stumps, but misses it by a whisker!"
231,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run Rohit has a direct hit, but Warner is well home after a push towards mid-off. Decent throw off that angle, but despite being on the back foot Warner was immensely quick off the blocks"
232,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run gets back and across and tucks the shortish delivery away towards midwicket"
233,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs width offered and Finch accepts the present as he flays the fuller ball over mid-off. Powerful stroke"
234,"Shami to Finch, no run decides to go along the ground this time as he drives a good length ball into the covers"

236,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs despairing dive from Kohli at deep square leg, but Warner's pull has too much heat on it. Shami errs by bowling short and a bit too straight"
237,"Shami to Warner, no run stands and delivers a whip, which mid-on does well to stop, diving away to his right"
238,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs goes full on the pads this time and Warner works it to deep midwicket and takes on Virat Kohli's throw. Big dive, easily home"

242,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run great work from short point, Suresh Raina moves to his right and stops a cracking cut shot. The deflection though is potential for a single and Warner capitalises"
243,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run shortish, but not quite wide enough. Warner slaps it to cover"
244,"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run picked away off his hips to long leg. Has the leg-side short-ball bug caught Bhuvi too?"
245,"Yadav to Warner, OUT skies it! Raina calls for it immediately and yells in delight after completing a soft dismissal. It was short of a good length, but Warner's front foot press works against him. Then he decided to play a sort of a pull shot when there wasn't much room. Ends up spooning a simple catch at extra cover, which was well taken."
246,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run full and slipping down leg, Finch helps it away to long leg"
247,"Yadav to Watson, no run starts well against the new man, probing just a shade outside off with that in-between length. But to Watson and his famous front-foot press, that doesn't matter. Leaves it"
248,"Yadav to Watson, no run gets forward and blocks a back of a length delivery to cover"

258,"Yadav to Finch, no run back of a length on fifth stump, Finch brings down a straight bat"
259,"Yadav to Finch, no run forces a good length ball to cover point. India are stringing together a good stretch of dots now"
260,"Yadav to Finch, no run beaten off a beautiful delivery, and the pressure that's been built. Attempts something extravagant off a back of a length delivery outside off as he steps forward ti drive on the up"
261,"Yadav to Finch, no run 141kph, gets the ball to straighten and beat Finch all ends up! Finishes with a maiden as India concede only eight runs in the last four overs, and the wicket of Warner"
262,"Axar Patel to Watson, FOUR runs drags the length short and Watson camps back in his crease and cuts behind point. Not the best start from yet another Indian bowler"
263,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run that's quicker and it skids into Watson way too quick for the pull. Mistimes into the leg side"
264,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run tossed up on middle and leg, tucked to short midwicket"

267,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run fired in on middle, Finch keeps it out"
268,"Yadav to Watson, no run wafts outside off and is beaten by a back of a length delivery outside off. Good channels from Umesh"

270,"Yadav to Watson, 1 run a bit of extra bounce for Umesh as he hits back of a length and outside off, Watson dabs it to third man"
271,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run shortish on middle and leg, the batsman hops up off his feet to find mid-on"

274,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run nudged to the left of short midiwcket as Akshar does what he does - cramp the batsman for room with his darts"
275,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run huge appeal from Akshar as Finch attempts something different. Gets a decent stride forward to sweep a fuller ball on off stump. Just a hint of turn, and perhaps the umpire thinks it would miss the target. Kohli is gutted, even comes up to ask the ump for a clarification. The impact might have been outside off"
276,"Axar Patel to Finch, FOUR runs pressure release as the ball is a bit short and Shami is not the best man at point, can't get across to his left fast enough"
277,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run tapped away towards short midwicket"

281,"Yadav to Watson, no run back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers where Kohli is very alert"

301,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run tries to make his own room by moving leg side of the ball, but can't pierce the cover field"
302,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run this time Akshar provides a hint of width and it's been sliced through cover"
303,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run backs away and punches the flatter delivery outside off through cover. That's Australia's hundred"
304,"Ashwin to Watson, no run good length ball on off stump, Watson defends carefully"
