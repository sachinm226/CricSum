241,"There's a feeling of deja vu from Pakistan. An innings based around a good century, this time from Mohammad Rizwan, but that falls short of 300. It's a decent total, but far from overwhelming. They will have to bowl and field well. Australia will certainly take it having lost Jhye Richardson after five of his overs to a shoulder injury. Aaron Finch bowling"
242,"7.05pm Pakistan walk onto the field and form a huddle ahead of the second dig. If you missed any of the action earlier, it's nicely summed up in Danyal Rasool's match report of a game that so far bears a striking resemblance to that played out between these teams on Friday."

333,"Yasir Shah to Finch, SIX runs biffed over long on! There's a fielder in place down there, but Finch takes him on with a thump down the ground. He hits it hard, and not too high but far enough to beat a leaping fielder at the boundary's edge"
