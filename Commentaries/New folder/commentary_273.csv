83,"Maxwell to Stokes, no run drifts into Stokes, strangled appeal for lbw but wasn't particularly close"
84,"Doherty to Bell, 1 run, OUT direct hit! Warner has pulled off a stunning run out. England continue to create their own problems.

249,"Christian to Bresnan, SIX runs that's into the second tier over deep midwicket! Christian just got the length slightly, on a length, allowing him to get underneath and launch it clear into the stands"
250,"Christian to Bresnan, SIX runs and again! Late boost for England. This time it was shorter and he pulled it, not quite so well time as the previous one but enough brute force to just clear Maxwell at deep midwicket"
251,"Christian to Bresnan, 1 run gets the yorker in, driven down the ground"
252,"Christian to Tredwell, 1 run opens the face to backward point to give Bresnan the last ball"
253,"Christian to Bresnan, 1 run inches from another boundary...Bresnan lapped a low full toss from outside off, but Coulter-Nile pulled off a terrific dive at short fine leg so it's just a single"
254,"England finish with 243. You feel that's about 25 short, but those late blows from Tim Bresnan has just given them a little of hope. The pitch is slow and gripping, especially once the new ball(s) wear off. The stand-out feature, though, was Australia's fielding. Some magnificent stuff on show. We can expect Warner and Finch to"
255,"Welcome back for the chase, Australia's openers have made their way out on to the SCG and the hosts need 244 to take this series without worrying about the remaining two games. There were some very useful late runs from Tim Bresnan in England's innings - will that be the difference? It's Chris Jordan with the first of the new b"
256,"Jordan to Finch, no run can't get bat on the first one, this lobs off the body in front of Finch after he tried to turn it to leg"
257,"Jordan to Finch, 1 run oh dear, what is going on out there? Warner has nearly been run out without facing a ball. Finch has punched it to cover and called a single, Warner basically gave up on the run about three-quarters down the pitch but the throw missed"

269,"Jordan to Finch, 2 runs on the pads and Finch has no trouble clipping this away behind square for a couple"

273,"Jordan to Warner, no run inswing to Warner's leg-stump line and it's defended"
274,"Jordan to Warner, 1 run too much down leg from Jordan, who just can't quite find his line, and Warner easily works it through square leg"
275,"Broad to Warner, 1 run another very quick single as Warner pushes to off and runs immediately, good judgment"

279,"Broad to Warner, 1 run Warner nudges this off the hips to leg for another comfortable single"
280,"Broad to Finch, no run better from Broad, a touch of away swing and outside off, that's where you may just get Finch early in his innings - he pushes it to point"
281,"Broad to Finch, 1 run and back to the pads - Finch clips it through square again"
282,"Jordan to Finch, 1 run better line outside off from Jordan and Finch pushes it away through point"
283,"Jordan to Warner, no run fullish and on off stump, Warner drives down towards mid-off"
284,"Jordan to Warner, no run Jordan at 146kph here, tempts Warner outside off but it's not as short as Warner thought - his cut misses"
285,"Jordan to Warner, 1 run shorter now and on the leg stump, Warner pulls it around the corner down to fine leg"
286,"Jordan to Finch, no run Finch is solid in defence now on off stump"
287,"Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs thumpingly strong straight drive from Aaron Finch now, he's got a fullish straight ball and punched it back from whence it came - so straight it's very nearly hit the non-striker's stumps."

290,"Broad to Warner, no run crunches a cut away that isn't quite timed"

293,"Broad to Warner, 2 runs clipped off the pads now as the line is wrong again"
294,"Jordan to Finch, 1 wide England just can't get their bowling right - this is yet another one skewed down leg for a wide"
295,"Jordan to Finch, no run there's an lbw shout here and Jordan is pretty interested but the umpire isn't - Finch drove hard at a straight ball. England decide against a review and it's a good call - there was an inside edge there."

297,"Jordan to Warner, no run Warner waits on this one and steers it to point"
298,"Jordan to Warner, 1 run clipped off the pads and away to fine leg"
299,"Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs Finch gets on the back foot now and crunches it through point, fine timing and placement"
300,"Jordan to Finch, OUT Jordan has struck! The runs were flowing but Finch couldn't stop himself driving hard in the air and there is a man at cover who has no trouble holding this catch. He'll be disappointed with himself there - just couldn't keep that along the ground"
301,"Bresnan to Warner, no run on the back foot now, Warner defends"
302,"Bresnan to Warner, SIX runs what a shot! Warner has picked a length ball and just hit right through it, driving hard and down the ground over long-off, with enough timing to clear the boundary"

306,"Bresnan to Warner, 1 run oh, Warner has nearly joined Finch back in the rooms! He's gone for the pull from a shortish ball but didn't get hold of it, the top edge flies out and lobs just over the head of the midwicket - that wasn't far away at all"

313,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run Marsh finally gets to face a ball after two overs at the non-striker's end - he gets off the mark with a nudge to leg"
314,"Bresnan to Warner, FOUR runs short ball from Bresnan and Warner has nailed this pull, he was very quickly on to that and pulled it up into the air, wide of the man at deep midwicket and it's one bounce over the boundary"
315,"Bresnan to Warner, no run shortish outside off now and Warner tries to dab at that, misses the ball though"
316,"Bresnan to Warner, FOUR runs really good placement once again - Warner has cut this hard off the back foot and found the gap between point and cover"
317,"Bresnan to Warner, no run fuller and outside off, Warner pushes to point"
318,"Bresnan to Warner, FOUR runs another boundary now as Warner gets on on the hips and glances it wide of fine leg, who is in the circle, which in turn means that is always going to run away for four"

327,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run on the back foot and Marsh defends"
328,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run Marsh waits on this one and cuts very late, just a single though to third man"

333,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run tossed up outside off at 84kph and it's defended"

335,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run defended away to the off side"
336,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run Marsh again defends carefully"
337,"Bresnan to Warner, no run Warner drives hard down the ground but this is cut off by mid-off - that ball was flying!"

354,"Bopara to Marsh, no run is this a catch? No! Oh boy, that was close. Angled across Marsh, who drove hard outside off and it flew low towards backward point, where Morgan dived forward and took the ball pretty cleanly, but it must have been on the half-volley as he wasn't interested in asking the question about a catch. T"

373,"Tredwell to Warner, 1 run touch quicker and flatter, no surprise there, and tucked into midwicket"
374,"Broad to Warner, FOUR runs he's on a roll, doesn't allow Broad to settle in, it's a length delivery on the stumps and Warner lofts it over mid-off. Wasn't out of the middle. Didn't matter."
375,"Broad to Warner, no run more energy on this delivery, 137kph, and beats Warner as he goes for a cut"

421,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run now Marsh uses his feet as well, not quite so light as Clarke but just as effective as he then works down the ground"
422,"Jordan to Marsh, 2 runs close! Just wide of cover. Marsh drives on the up and it goes wide of a diving Bell as he leaps to his left. Bottom hand came off the bat. Maybe a slower delivery which stopped in the pitch"
