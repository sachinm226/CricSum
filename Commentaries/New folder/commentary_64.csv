0,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run lovely length, squares Khawaja up as he defends from the crease"
1,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run full and swinging across, left alone"
2,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run rooted to the crease as he negotiates this full delivery on leg stump"
3,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, FOUR runs whips this wide of the diving Vijay Shankar at square leg. Delightful balance and wrist work. Bhuvi punished for going too short."
4,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run touch fuller, just around off stump, defended"
5,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run gets right on top of the bounce and turns this short of length delivery into the leg side. Decent first over to begin with."
6,"Shami to Finch, no run beauty! Drew him forward with a full length delivery and got it to move away off the seam. Moved a long way away after it passed the bat. That should wake up Finch"
7,"Shami to Finch, 1 run nearly chopped on! Looks to force this length ball on the up but he's cramped for room. Manages to scamper a run and get off the mark. Rolled just wide of leg stump."
8,"Shami to Khawaja, no run slants one nice and full across the left-hander, defended"
9,"Shami to Khawaja, no run works this full-length delivery towards mid-on. Nice, tight line from Shami"
10,"Shami to Khawaja, FOUR runs crunching cover drive! Errs in length by a very small margin and gets spanked. Juicy half-volley"
11,"Shami to Khawaja, no run whips this from length on middle to midwicket"
12,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, FOUR runs plants forward, uses the width and flays this on the up through extra cover. Driving without a trace of worry that time. Lovely execution"
13,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run full outside off, defends towards Jadeja at point as they scamper a quick single"
14,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run huge appeal, huge appeal but Joel Wilson says not out immediately. Kohli straightaway went up to his bowler to ask if he wanted to go upstairs. They decide against DRS . This was definitely sliding down leg, but worth an appeal? Could've come back as umpire's call"
15,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, FOUR runs the whip of the wrists! Magnificent. Too short from Bhuvi, Khawaja stands tall and wrists this behind square on the leg side to pepper the short boundary."
16,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run stopped well on the followthrough! This was hit back hard, Bhuvi put his left hand out to half-stop."
17,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, 1 run still finds the leg side gap, but hits this straight to fine leg."
18,"Shami to Khawaja, FOUR runs balance and timing absolutely impeccable as he puts this juicy half-volley on the pads to the midwicket boundary. Poor from Shami, no batsman worth his salt will miss out on a gift like this."
19,"Shami to Khawaja, no run beauty! Good comeback. Gets one to angle in and nip away off the deck, Khawaja has a poke but misses."
20,"Shami to Khawaja, FOUR runs we're seeing wrist work of the highest quality here! Khawaja plays a magical on-drive to this incoming length ball. The non-striker had to just get his bat out of the way to see this scream away to the boundary."
21,"Shami to Khawaja, 1 run goes for a big drive, but this swerves in a long way, gets a thick inside edge to mid-on where Bumrah misfields"
22,"Shami to Finch, no run driven on the up but straight to extra cover"
23,"Shami to Finch, no run excellent delivery. Angles one back in off a length, Finch plays outside the line to get an inside edge onto the pad."
24,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, 1 run gets a thickish edge down to square third man"
25,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run nice and full on the stumps from wide of the crease, defended towards mid-on"
26,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shows the full face of the bat as he bunts this length ball back down the pitch"
27,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run gets a good stride forward as he authoritatively defends this length delivery to cover."
28,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run hint of width outside off, eased to third man"
29,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run driven down the ground but straight to Vijay at mid-off"
30,"Shami to Finch, no run cracker-jack! Finch feels for one that leaves him ever-so-slightly off the seam as the ball whizzes past the outside edge. Magic, pure magic"
31,"Shami to Finch, no run thuds into the pad as it slants back in off a length. Finch beten for pace"
32,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs delightful square drive! You know it's well timed when Ravindra Jadeja gives up chase from backward point."
33,"Shami to Finch, no run stands tall and bunts this length delivery back down the pitch"
34,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs beats mid-off. Delightful punch on the up through the gap. Too short from Shami, excellent hand-eye coordination from Finch."
35,"Shami to Finch, no run shows the full face of the bat to defend this back"
36,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run and beats the bat immediately! Khawaja feels for this length ball outside off with an angled bat"
37,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run looks to cut, this one stays low to beat the underedge."
38,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 2 runs tumbling stop by Gabbar Dhawan at long leg! This one was nicely whipped off is hip, saved a couple of runs for the side"
39,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 1 run direct hit from Kohli running in from cover point but Finch seems in. Khawaja walked into the drive but was cramped for room and got it off a thick inside edge onto the pad. Fortunately for Australia, there was no hesitation between the pair."
40,"Bumrah to Finch, no run slants one back in, defended."
41,"Bumrah to Finch, no run goes right back and across to punch this back"
42,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run nearly chopped onto the stumps as he looks to run it down towards third man, Pant hares in to prevent a run"
43,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run works this length ball on off to midwicket"
44,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run mix-up, mix-up, but no damage done. Khawaja whips to Shami at mid-on, takes a few steps across, but fortunately turns back in the nick of time."
45,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, FOUR runs lovely off-drive, no one moved. This is superb, not a bad ball by any means but he just leans into the drive and times it magnificently"
46,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run driven but straight to mid-off"
47,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, 1 run gets across and whips this uppishly to Vijay at deep square leg"

49,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run bunts this straight to short cover"

51,"Bumrah to Finch, no run bunts this incoming length ball towards mid-off"
52,"Bumrah to Finch, no run skids back in to hit him high on the thigh pad. Going down leg as Finch is late on the shot."
53,"Bumrah to Finch, no run punched on the up but can't pierce the packed off-side ring as Kohli stops at cover point"
54,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, 1 run tucks this down to fine leg"
55,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run full and straight on the stumps, defended to mid-on"
56,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 3 runs too straight, too much leg side and Finch whips this into the acres of open space towards deep midwicket. Jadhav had to run around from deep square. Third half-century stand for the pair this series"
57,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run punched on the up to mid-off"
58,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, 1 run works this off his hip to deep square"

63,"Bumrah to Finch, no run allows the ball to slide in as he steers this length all to point"
64,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run flicks imperiously to Vijay at deep square leg. This was a juicy half-volley on the pads"
65,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run gets on top of the bounce and cuts, excellent stop by Jadeja moving low to his right at point"
66,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run starts with a googly that pitches outside leg, Finch struck on the body as he plays all around it."
67,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run steps out, doesn't quite get to the pitch but ends up hitting it off a thick inside edge towards long-on"
68,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run drifts into middle and leg, he steps out and works this low full toss wide of mid-on"
69,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run wrong'un on a length, Finch goes back and across as he tucks it to deep square leg."
70,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, SIX runs solid hit! Excellent use of the feet to get to the pitch as he wallops it over long-on. Short straight boundaries but that would've cleared the biggest of them all. Clean hit"
71,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 2 runs rocks back and plays this very late to beat short third man, Bhuvi in pursuit but manages to pull it back in"
72,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball angling in, kept out."
73,"Bumrah to Finch, no run tucks this incoming delivery to midwicket"

79,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run steps out and drives inside-out to wide long-off"
80,"Kuldeep to Finch, FOUR runs steps out and bang! Kuldeep didn't even try to put hit hand out on the followthrough."
81,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run belted back, somehow Kuldeep half-stops and parries it towards midwicket. He really gave this a whack"
82,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run lunges forward and smothers this wrong'un with soft hands"
83,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run steps out and negotiates this shortish delivery into the leg side."
84,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run nice flight and dip, defended back"
85,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 2 runs paddled down to fine leg. Predetermined paddle, gets away. Got well outside the line to try and execute that"
86,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run tucks this wide of square leg. Got well forward and then brought his wrists into play"
87,"Jadeja to Finch, OUT ripper of a delivery! When he starts like this, he's a different bowler. It's the fizz off the pitch that does the trick. Fires this in towards length on middle, Finch is drawn forward by the angle but then sees this ball spin away just about enough to beat the straight bat to smash into the stumps. What a ball, what a bowler."
88,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run drifting into the pads, worked positively to mid-on"
89,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run lunges forward and smothers this."
90,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run tucks this wide of square leg to get off the mark"
91,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run makes room and cuts to deep point, hint of confusion. Handscomb wanted the second, Khawaja didn't"
92,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run draws him into a drive with tossed up delivery, Khawaja tempted to drive but lets go"
93,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run steps out and turns this full and flat delivery wide of midwicket"
94,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, FOUR runs swept from a long way outside off, the timing and placement is magnificent! Cracking stroke, best part is that is risk-free. Rolled his wrists over the delivery to keep it all along the ground. No chance for deep square."
95,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, FOUR runs through with the sweep even before the ball arrived, may have got a thin edge onto it as this lobs over the keeper's head off the top-edge. Races away, lucky runs but he'll take them."
96,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run steps out and drives this full toss to extra cover."
97,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run tosses it up outside off, he guides it to point"
98,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run there's fifty and it comes off a well judged sweep shot, getting down low, picking the length ball well outside off - which puts lbw out of play - and rolling his wrists on top of the ball to prevent the top edge"
99,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run excellent batting! He spots the short ball early, leaps back in his crease and using the full face of the bat, punches it through cover"
100,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run waits on the flatter delivery outside off and dinks it around the corner behind square leg"
101,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run good bowling. He tosses it up onto middle stump, and with Handscomb's fondness for staying back in the crease, he needs to be extra careful putting bat to the ball. And he is, with a flick behind square leg"
102,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run the wrists save Khawaja there as he rolls them on top of a rapidly dipping delivery, and even though he is nowhere near the pitch of it outside off, he is able to keep it down to midwicket. Good end to the over from Jadeja. He looks India's most threatening bowler right now"
103,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run leans forward onto leg stump and turns the left-arm legbreak to square leg"
104,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run rocks back against a ball that is only slightly short in length, making room to take it off the stumps, but can't find the gap at cover point"
105,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run shimmies down a little bit, but Kuldeep pulls his length back just enough that Handscomb is happy to nudge it to square leg"
106,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 2 runs goes for the sweep, taking a tossed up delivery outside off and directing it to fine leg. Might have been risky on other pitches, but here, where there is low bounce, batsmen don't have to fear the top-edge"
107,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run there we go again. That's Handscomb's whole plan against Kuldeep. Whenever he pitches it up, he gets down low and plays a very measured sweep. Head still, fully balanced and such lovely hands to keep it down"
108,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run defends the tossed up ball outside off with an open face"
109,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run hangs back against a length ball angling into him, making room to punch it through the covers"
110,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run premeditates the sweep, which allows Jadeja to toss the ball up well outside off and beat the left-hander. Or beat him enough that the bottom edge pings onto his own pad"
111,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run this time the sweep works as Jadeja goes faster and flatter outside off. Single behind square leg"
112,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run stays inside the line - which seems to be his plan against Jadeja - and drives the tossed pu ball on leg stump back at the bowler. Good dive from Jadeja to stop it"
113,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run pushes back to defend a flatter delivery on leg stump"
114,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run goes a little wide of the crease to spear the ball on leg stump but Handscomb's footwork and balance is so good that he has absolutely no trouble driving inside-out to long-off"
115,"Jadhav to Handscomb, FOUR runs steps out and lifts the part-timer to the wide long-on boundary. Welcome back Kedar. I've missed you, says Handscomb"
116,"Jadhav to Handscomb, no run poor shot selection - Handscomb goes to sweep Jadhav but this ball is basically a yorker on middle stump and his inside edge basically saves him from an early walk back"
117,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run shimmies down the track and drives a tossed up delivery, drifting away from the right-hander, to long-off"
118,"Jadhav to Khawaja, 1 run loops it up from round the wicket and Khawaja taps it down to long-on"
119,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run stays beside the line of the ball outside off and dabs it to short third man"
120,"Jadhav to Khawaja, 1 run good length outside off, Khawaja knocks it down to the right of Jadhav, who tries to stop if himself, but his dive doesn't quite work"
121,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 3 runs pulls off the reverse sweep and Shami has a race on his hands. Does well to stop it on the edge of the boundary. Good length ball outside off was basically inviting the shot and the field was placed in expectation of a top edge"
122,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run full on off stump, he presses forward to block"
123,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run stays back, opens up his body so he can whip a good length ball from outside off away through midwicket. Excellent batting against spin"
124,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run defends the tossed up delivery, dipping at the last, on him with a perfectly straight bat. Good spot from Khawaja"
125,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run loads up the reverse sweep, and even though the flatter, quicker delivery is cramping him on leg stump, he's able to find a single to deep square leg"
126,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run angles the full delivery into the pads and Handscomb deftly turns it behind square leg"
127,"Shami to Handscomb, 2 runs oooh, is that reverse? Shami is able to get a fuller delivery to curl into the right-hander, but not so dangerously that Handscomb isn't able to pick it away through midwicket"
128,"Shami to Handscomb, 1 run tries to tie him down on leg stump again, but Handscomb whips it behind square leg"
129,"Shami to Khawaja, FOUR runs that is glorious! Gets up to his full height and swivels on the back foot, totally in control of the pull shot, and the ball just disappears like it finds a pocket dimension that leads to the midwicket boundary"
130,"Shami to Khawaja, no run fullish and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
131,"Shami to Khawaja, no run beats him outside off! This is sexy old-ball bowling. Hits the deck, gets it to respond and Khawaja's hopeful glide to third man comes off second best"
132,"Shami to Khawaja, 1 run another short ball, this time though he targets Khawaja's right armpit, refusing him the room that was given earlier in the over. The pull shot comes out again but only for a single through square leg"
133,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run flicks a tossed up ball outside off towards long-on, but Jadeja puts in the dive"
134,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run with the ball pitching outside off, he's happy to go for the reverse sweep. No chance of lbw. No chance of runs either on this occasion as it finds point"
135,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run whips the quicker delivery on leg stump to long-on"
136,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run waits nicely on middle and leg, allowing the flighted ball to come to him, and then rolls his wrists on it, directing it to midwicket"
137,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run lunges forward trying to get to the pitch of the ball outside off and drives along the ground towards long-off. Jadeja won't allow that"
138,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run wanders outside leg, picking the length as short, and slices the ball on off stump behind point. Serene batting against spin"
139,"Shami to Handscomb, 1 run walks down the pitch and hacks the back of a length ball straight of midwicket for a quick single."
140,"Shami to Khawaja, FOUR runs the short ball isn't working on this pitch. There just isn't enough bounce for that to be a reasonably tactic. Shami bangs it into the deck as well as he could, but it just sits up for Khawaja to hammer it over midwicket. Straight of midwicket even"
141,"Shami to Khawaja, no run goes round the wicket - because that last ball had soooooo much room - and he beats him immediately. The length is a lot better - trapping the batsman in his crease - and Khawaja's slice behind point makes him look less than the most in-form batsman of the series"
142,"Shami to Khawaja, 2 runs waits on the back of a length delivery to come onto him and the deflects it to long leg"
143,"Shami to Khawaja, no run steps forward to the shortish delivery outside off and steers it to point"
144,"Shami to Khawaja, no run cramps him with a quick and short delivery on off stump and Khawaja has to jump off his crease to get on top of the ball and knock it down"
145,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run his back foot play is always top-class. Judges the ball to be short and on off stump, so he makes a little room and gently steers the bal lthrough point"
146,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run gets down low to reverse sweep the tossed up ball outside off. Finds short third man"
147,"Jadeja to Khawaja, FOUR runs a little more power in the shot - thanks to the width on offer - and the reverse sweep flies away to the right of short third man"
148,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run tons of power on this reverse sweep too - which is surprising since Jadeja spots the batsman's premeditated movement and fires it into the leg side. Single to deep point"
149,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run drills the tossed up delivery on off stump to short cover. Rohit misfields"
150,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run goes back and flicks a shortish delivery outside off through square leg"
151,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run sees Khawaja's intentions to dance down the track and so drags the ball well wide of off stump. The left-hander has to reach out - looking uncharacteristically ungainly - to cut the ball through point"
152,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run rocks back against the short ball outside off and taps it with practically the full face of the bat to long-off."
153,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, SIX runs this is beautiful batting! He sees the flight on this so early. He charges out to meet it. And he unfurls a full swing of that straight bat. High, handsome, straight, ridiculously cool six! Anmd that prompts a chat between Kuldeep and Kohli"
154,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run changes his line wide outside off and pulls the length back a bit. Khawaja likes the room and goes for the sweep but he misses altogether"
155,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run good length ball on off stump, defends"
156,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run he's already shifting outside off as Kuldeep is walking in to bowl, expecting the legspinner to bowl outside off, and when that happens, he nails the sweep well in front of midwicket."
157,"Jadeja to Khawaja, no run goes round the wicket, targeting Khawaja's pads, he works it through square leg"
158,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run loops it up on off stump, Khawaja hammers it down to long-on"
159,"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run gets inside the line of a loopy delivery outside off but in perhaps trying to hit it too hard, he mistimes it back at the bowler. Or maybe he was checking his shot considering Jadeja's dip"
160,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run full and outside off, he smears it through the covers and Rohit isn't able to get low to his left quickly enough to stop it"
161,"Jadeja to Khawaja, FOUR runs drags it way too short - which happens so very rarely with Jadeja - but Khawaja is soooooo good here. Leaps back into his crease and pulling it in front of the fielder at square leg. Splendid manipulation of the field"
162,"Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 run nudges the fuller delivery on middle through midwicket"
163,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run short and wide but Khawaja finds point with his cut shot."
164,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run there we go, he waits a little longer with this cut shot, hoping to find the gap between point and third man. Doesn't quite manage it but does get the single with short third man having to move to his left"
165,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run there's the googly!. Handscomb goes down to sweep it and - with the ball tossed up wide and turning away - he mistimes it through square leg"
166,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run nudges it through midwicket"
167,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run another sweep - this one to the legbreak wide outside off - as Handscomb finds a single behind square leg"
168,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run rolls the wrists over the legbreak outside off, largely because it dips on him and he doesn't want to pop it up in the air. Single through cover"
169,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run almost chops on! Bumrah coming round the wicket for a back of a length delivery outside off. Khawaja is on the hop, his bat coming down at an angle which enables the mis-hit"
170,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run full and outside off, he drives to cover."
171,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run back of a length and outside off, he opens the face and runs it to third man"
172,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run presents the full face of the bat, even though he's a little squared up on off stump. He has to do that really with Bumrah hitting the deck and getting it to straighten. That strong wrist and the hyper-extension of his elbow allows him to get more from the pitch than most other bowlers"
173,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 1 run straightens again but Khawaja is ready for this time time, staying back in his crease, waitin for it to come to him outside off and guiding it behind point"
174,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
175,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run shortish and outside off, he shapes to cut, but is beaten"
176,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 2 runs presses forward as he waits for Kuldeep to delivery but the moment he reads the flight and realises this is short, he's back and across, ready with the cut shot"
177,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run googly which is quicker and closer to off stump. Also keeps low, meaning Khawaja has to adjust, straightening his back leg and cutting to point"
178,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run"
179,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, no run another quick googly on and around off sutmp and Khawaja is very nearly bowled as he sets up for a cut shot again. Last minute change to a straight bat slice to point saves him in the end"
180,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run good length ball outside off - this one turns away from the left-hander, allowing the cut shot to deep point"
181,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run whirls his wrists over a shortish delivery outside off in an effort to smuggle it through midwicket. No such luck"
182,"Bumrah to Khawaja, 1 run slower ball, which he picks and plays with the angle from round the wicket to deep square leg"
183,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run firm push to extra cover as Bumrah keeps banging the ball in at back of a length, hoping the low bounce will help him get a wicket"
184,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run searing yorker, and it is all the more difficult because of the late inswing. Handscomb just about deals with it, the inside edge of his bat coming in very handy!"
185,"Bumrah to Handscomb, 2 runs follows it up with the slower ball, but Handscomb is ready for that too, holding his shape until it comes close enough that he can guide it behind point"
186,"Bumrah to Handscomb, no run slogs a good length ball on off stump down to mid-on - and the reason it only went that far is because he checks his shot, knowing Australia cannot afford to lose a wicket now. Not when they've taken out two of Bumrah's overs off the death"
187,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run cuts the shortish delivery outside off to deep point and mores to 99"
188,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 2 runs eases down the pitch and chips the legbreak on leg stump over the infield. The timing is so good that it nearly wanders all the way to the boundary - it has no business getting that far - but Jadhav stops it with a big old dive."
189,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, FOUR runs googly gets the edge and it beats Pant! Too thick for the wicketkeeper to do anything about it. Has no time to react. Handscomb backs away to try and open up the off side, but he's given himself too much room and is panicking as the ball turns away from him rather sharply. Gets a big edge, which is lucky for him because it takes the ball well away from the only catcher in the region"
190,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run full on off stump, Handscomb holds his shape as it comes down slowly and then punches it to long-on"
191,"Kuldeep to Khawaja, 1 run stays back and guides the length ball on middle through cover and jogs through for his second hundred in three innings! Gorgeous batting from Khawaja and Delhi appreciates it. Even this shot - for a single - shows off the reason why he's succeeded on this tour. Plays late. Wiats for the turn. Soft hands."
192,"Kuldeep to Handscomb, 1 run sweeps the length ball on middle stump to deep square leg"
193,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run lovely straight drive from Handscomb. Stays legside of the ball, perhaps because there is a little bit of reverse swing out there, and presents the full face"
194,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 1 run carves the back of a length delivery outside off into the covers and sprints through"
195,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run mistimes a swat down the ground, the fuller delivery outside off going off the bottom edge back to the bowler"
196,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
197,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, no run beats him on the pull as Bhuvi's short ball goes under Khawaja's bat"
198,"Bhuvneshwar to Khawaja, OUT leaves his wicket giftwrapped at Kohli's feet. A harmless ba outside off, tempting the drive on the up. Khawaja obliges, not taking the care he has done all innings to keep the ball down, or away from a fielder. Goes straight to the Indian captain. Delhi roars in approval. Khawaja, meanwhile, is devastated, basically dragging himself off the field."
199,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run driven with the spin to cover."
200,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run drifts in and skids through, Maxwell defends"
201,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run drives one and gets it off a thickish inside edge towards long-on"
202,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run uses the depth of the crease superbly to force this towards deep point where an off-balanced Vijay hurls a superb throw. Saved three runs"
203,"Jadeja to Maxwell, OUT back-to-back wickets, Jadeja is pumped, Kohli even more. Maxwell has fallen looking to hit this over cover. Didn't get the elevation because he didn't get to the pitch. This also spun away a wee bit more than he expected, and Kohli is extremely alert at extra cover."
204,"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run"
205,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run length ball angling into middle and leg, tucked to midwicket where Kohli is supremely alert as he dives full-length to his left to keep Handscomb on 49"
206,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run nearly chopped on! The slowness of the surface starting to show up here. Looks to force this on the up through cover point."
207,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run reverse? Ooohhh, exciting. Veers in late, he defends forward and gets a thickish inside edge towards mid-on."
208,"Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 1 run steered down to square third man to bring up back-to-back half-centuries for Handscomb"
209,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, no run length on off, Handscomb defends as he gets half forward"

216,"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run touch short, punched down to long-off"
217,"Shami to Handscomb, no run run-out chance missed at the bowler's end. Bunted to short cover, Jadhav hurls one just wide to reprieve Stoinis who was well outside the crease."
218,"Shami to Handscomb, OUT wicket denied at one end, but Shami provides one at the other, and it's a cracker of a delivery. Lifter that completely takes Handscomb aback as he is forced to play at this because of the length, but the ball kisses the shoulder and flies to Pant who takes a superb catch. Massive break for India. They've come storming back."
219,"Shami to Turner, FOUR runs what a way to get off the mark! This one tailed in late but Turner plays it late, brings his wrists into play to flick this into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Lovely timing."
220,"Shami to Turner, 2 runs driven firmly on the up to sweeper cover, aggressive running to complete the second"
221,"Shami to Turner, no run full on off, defended from the crease."
222,"Shami to Turner, no run plays too early, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad. Rolls to the off side as he tries to scamper a run but it isn't there."
223,"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run punched on the up to sweeper cover for a single."
224,"Jadeja to Turner, no run length ball sliding back in, defended."

226,"Jadeja to Turner, no run drifts into middle and leg, tucks this into the leg side."
227,"Jadeja to Turner, FOUR runs goes for a big drive but ends up getting a thin edge past the keeper, short third man gave up the chase very early"
228,"Jadeja to Turner, no run works this with the angle towards square leg. Jadeja bowls out, top spell."
229,"Shami to Stoinis, no run hits the hard length, defended from the crease."
230,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run slower and fuller on the stumps, he drops it gently into the off side for a quick single."

233,"Shami to Turner, 1 run length on middle and leg, he tucks this with the angle towards deep square"

235,"Kuldeep to Turner, no run shortish delivery, punched to cover point"
236,"Kuldeep to Turner, 1 run wrong'un that squares him up, squirted to short third man for a quick single."
237,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run steps out and then jabs this away wide of cover with his pad. There was a stifled appeal from Kuldeep, but obviously he was too far down the pitch"
238,"Kuldeep to Turner, no run defended towards cover, single denied as Kohli swoops in quickly"
239,"Kuldeep to Turner, 1 run pulled away but straight to Vijay at deep midwicket"
240,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run makes room and cuts to the cover fielder at the edge of the ring."
241,"Bumrah to Turner, no run veers a length ball into the body, squirted to short midwicket"

245,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run defends back to the bowler with a straight bat"
246,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run right behind the line as he defends this incoming length ball"
247,"Kuldeep to Turner, SIX runs clobbered over deep midwicket! Too short, picked the length early and gave it a whack"
248,"Kuldeep to Turner, 1 wide drifts one away but it's too far wide outside off, left alone"
249,"Kuldeep to Turner, OUT picks the wrong'un but hits against the turn in trying to loft this over long-on, no timing and it is well taken. Turner was looking to hit it much straighter, but ended up dragging it. Kuldeep has delivered a massive wicket. Excellent catch by Jadeja"
250,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, SIX runs steps out and belts this straight over the sightscreen, onto the old pavillion block. Lovely use of the feet."
251,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, no run makes room and forces this to cover"
252,"Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run toe-ends this full toss to long-on"
253,"Kuldeep to Carey, no run lunges forward and defends."

260,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run stands tall and punches to deep cover"
261,"Shami to Carey, 1 run too straight, on leg stump, tucked nicely to fine leg"
262,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run slower and fuller outside off, he makes room and creams this through cover, Kuldeep runs across to his left from mid-off and puts in a dive to effect a one-handed stop. Kohli runs across some 40-50 metres to slap a high five to his mate"
263,"Shami to Carey, 1 run works this off the pads towards deep midwicket"
264,"Shami to Stoinis, 2 runs works this lifter towards deep midwicket where substitute Rayudu is late to move to his right. For those asking, Rayudu is on for Jadhav"
265,"Shami to Stoinis, no run cramps him for room with a length ball on off stump, defended."
266,"Bhuvneshwar to Carey, 1 run length outside off, bunts this towards point to scamper a quick single. Stoinis was running towards the danger end as Jadeja fired a throw at the striker's end, didn't hit direct."
267,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, OUT chopped on! Too close to cut, this skidded through as well to get a thick inside edge onto the stumps. Stoinis' painful innings is over, didn't looked settled at any stage."
268,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 2 runs flicks, but keep it all along the ground. They beat Vijay's speed at deep midwicket to scamper a second"

275,"Shami to Carey, no run tucks this length ball to midwicket"
276,"Shami to Carey, OUT thin edge, excellent catch! Deceived by the slower one, Carey looking to glide this behind point but is foxed as he wafts and ends up getting bat as Pant dives forward to complete an excellent catch."
277,"Shami to Cummins, 1 run another offcutter, worked down the ground wide of mid-on"
278,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, no run defends this incoming length delivery into the leg side"
279,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, FOUR runs clears his front leg and biffs this length ball over mid-off. Solid blow"
280,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 3 runs hoicked across the line, the mishit lands between deep midwicket and wide long-on. Vijay runs around a long way from deep square and then puts in a dive on the run to pull it back in."
281,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 run slower and fuller on off, defended past the bowler"
282,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 1 run whips this length ball down to deep midwicket"
283,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 wide did it get something on the way? No, wide called. Good dive by Pant to stop that"
284,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 run dabs this behind square on the off side, rare miss by Jadeja at point and they take a quick single"
285,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, 2 runs chipped over midwicket, two? Dhawan can't prevent it. Good running"
286,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, FOUR runs edged and it races away past Pant's outstretched hands. Deliberately played, although he got it much finer than he would've liked."
287,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, FOUR runs scorching cover drive. Held his shape, laced this full delivery away. Pure timing, beats sweeper cover"
288,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, 4 runs ripper of a yorker, onto the toes. Squeezed back to Bumrah, who angrily fires a throw at the stumps. Guess what? It ricochets to the third man boundary, what should've been a dot is four runs now"
289,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, 1 run drills this back, Bumrah puts his right boot out to stop a certain boundary"
290,"Bumrah to Cummins, FOUR runs angling in, he makes room and deflects this length ball to the third man boundary, so very clever"
291,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 run mistimes this high full toss into the gap at midwicket"
292,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, 2 runs slower length ball, he makes room and punches this into the gap at sweeper cover"
293,"Bhuvneshwar to Cummins, OUT right into the blockhole, veering in late, squeezed back to Bhuvi. He goes up in an appeal, the umpires converge and then go upstairs. Soft signal: not out. Replays confirm Cummins has smashed it onto the pad. Bhuvi has a wicket as the decision is overturned. Cummins started walking upon seeing replays on the big screen. Very much possible that Wilson took a guess with the soft signal, another example of why this should"
294,"Bhuvneshwar to Lyon, 1 run gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
295,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 run slower length ball on off, squeezed towards backward point"

299,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, 1 run ugly hoick, mistimed to deep midwicket"
300,"Bumrah to Lyon, 1 bye veers in late, beats the inside edge. They scamper a bye as Pant flicks an underarm throw"
301,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, FOUR runs top-edges a wild heave, bounces wide of short third man and gathers steam to the boundary. Deceived by the slower one but gets away still. All Bumrah can do is have a laugh"
302,"Bumrah to Jhye Richardson, 1 run, OUT flicks this full toss to deep midwicket where Kohli fires a good throw on the bounce to Pant, who breaks the bails to beat Jhye Richardson's dive."
303,"5.10pm Not what Australia would've liked to finish on at 175 for 1. But they've given themselves a competitive score nonetheless on a slow and low Kotla deck. Having gotten into a tangle after Khawaja's century, things could've unravelled very quickly for Australia, but for that partnership between Jhye Richardson and Pat Cummins. By no means will this be an easy chase. Don't go too far away. Dan Brettig's mid-innings bulletin should be up soon. Will dew"
304,"Some reading material for you all while we wait for India's chase to begin. With the Tokyo Games just a year away, ESPN's Jonathan Selvaraj asks the one question on everyone's mind. Just how difficult is it for an Indian athlete to qualify for the Olympics? The answer - pretty darn difficult. Click here to read more"
305,"Facing that bowling attack - on this tough pitch - are two of the best openers in the world. Shikhar Dhawan, fresh off a career-best 143, and Rohit Sharma, who absolutely loves playing against Australia. Mohali was actually only the second time in 13-fifty plus scores that he fell in the 90s. Seven of those 13 scores went past 120!"
306,"5.45 pm The pitch is wearing. There is reverse swing on offer. Australia have a fine fast bowler in Pat Cummins, capable of bowling at any stage of the innings. Then there's the tearaway Jhye Richardson. He'll be fun to watch with the new ball. But in all likelihood, their best bets are the vastly improved Adam Zampa and the recalled Nathan Lyon."
307,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run gets carefully behind the shortish delivery on middle and even though there's a bit of movement for Cummins away from the batsman, Rohit blunts it beautifully"
308,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run pitches it up on off stump, Rohit eases forward and prevents its date with his sticks"
309,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run lovely line from Cummins, but Rohit is defying him as if he's a medium pacer. Confident forward step, sweet sound off the bat and the ball scurries to cover"
310,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run glorious drive as he picks the gap between cover and mid-off, but Finch, running to his left, puts in a dive and prevents it from going to the boundary"
311,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run hint of an inside edge with Dhawan expecting the length ball to carry on with the angle across him, but Cummins gets it to straighten just enough that it ends up at mid-off's hands instead of racing away through cover"
312,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run laces the short ball outside off to cover"
313,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run hesitation from Rohit, after he nudges a length ball towards square leg, but Dhawan pulls his partner through and he's safe, despite Khawaja's throw coming to his (non-strikers') end"
314,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run there's room to free the arms, but the slow pitch doesn't allow Dhawan to time the ball like he usually does. Cut finds cover"
315,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs whistles away to the square leg boundary. Mistake from Richardson, the ball pitching on leg stump and asking to be hit. Dhawan is definitely in the mood to oblige"
316,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs carves it through cover. The off side is fairly packed, but when there's that much room on offer, Dhawan can bring in all his power. Lashes it between cover and point"
317,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run goes round the wicket and Dhawan, waiting nicely for the pitched up ball on middle, flicks it to deep square leg. Delhi is ROARING"
318,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run fullish on off stump, Rohit defends."
319,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run oooh, he goes for the cut shot and it's a very rare occurance that he misses it altogether. Especially with so much room"
320,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run opens the face and guides the shortish delivery to point. Little closer to the body prompting a straight-bat shot"
321,"Cummins to S Dhawan, 1 run lovely batting. He's become so good on the leg side, waiting for the ball, perfectly balanced at the crease, and then the roll of the wrists to find a single at deep square leg"
322,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run closes the face to turn a fuller delivery on middle to midwicket."
323,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run inside edge as Rohit underestimates the movement that Cummins gets. Hits the deck hard, with the seam upright and the ball jags back after pitching to disrupt the batsman's flick shot"
324,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run full face of the bat as Rohit drives the fuller delivery to mid-off. Phew, just the composure he has to play proper shots even when he's not getting runs off them. The confidence that he can make it up later in the game..."
325,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run back of a length and outside off, Dhawan guides it into the covers, only this one seems to stop on him, forcing him to check his shot"
326,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run straying onto the pads and Dhawan sends it on a one-way trip to deep square leg. (It hitchhikes the way back though)"
327,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run pristine drive from Rohit again, but mid-off is lurking to deny him runs."
328,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length and outside off, Rohit waits on it and slice it away to deep third man"
329,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run shortish and on off stump, Dhawan has no room to work with and as a result has to settle for knocking it down to the bowler"
330,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run fullish and outside off, he drives through the covers"
331,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run gets squared up in dealing with a short ball on off stump. Cummins' strength to pound the new white ball into the deck is helping him get just enough sideways movement"
332,"Cummins to Kohli, no run good length ball outside off, Kohli guides it to point"
333,"Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs riiiidiculous! This is a fearsome fast bowler charging in at him, steaming coming out of his nose, but Kohli is so still at the crease, so cool coming forward to the pitched up ball, and so donwright dominant as he threads the gap at extra cover"
334,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run shuffles inside the line of the ball, hoping to deflect it to the fine leg boundary, but it thuds into his thigh and he has to settle for a single. Cummins, the bowler, gets across to it and tries to kick it at the stumps, but misses the target"
335,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs slices it! He likely wants to find the boundary in front of point, but a thick outside edge smuggles it to boundary on the right of the third man"
336,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 run hangs back, and leg side of the good length ball outside off, so he can steer it to deep third man"
337,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run good length on off stump draws Rohit forward with a punch to cover"
338,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run rides the bounce nicely - and he can do that because he is so still at the crease - to send the shortish and rising delivery outside off to cover point"
339,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs caresses it to the extra cover boundary. Rohit's driving has been sumptuous in this little innings. It's not always fetched him runs, but here, he takes care to find the gap too"
340,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep third man"
341,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 run risky run! But Kohli always fancies those. He brings those wrists down on a full delivery on middle stump and knowing he's mistimed it, he sprints across to the other end before Stoinis at mid-on can find the target at the non-strikers' end"
342,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run reads the length so early - short and outside off - and spirits it to deep third man."
343,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run cuts back in off the pitch as Richardson hits the deck, Rohit hangs back, letting the ball come onto him, and then taps it towards point"
344,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run right behind the short of a length ball on off stump"
345,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run OUCH!. Cummins again. The sheer strength he has to keep running in and hammer the back of a length produces magic even on pitches that troll fast bowlers for even existing. This rears up at Rohit. Worse. It cuts into him, at high pace, preventing him the time he needs to get out of the way. In the end, Rohit does well to glove it and keep it down"
346,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length and outside off, he steers towards cover"
347,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run waits on the shortish delivery on middle and turns it through midwicket"
348,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run shapes for the cut shot, but with the ball - shortish and outside off - not quite bouncing as much as he likes, he mistimes it into the covers"
349,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs breathtaking! All of his quality is condensed into this one moment. His balance. His timing. His ability to read length so early. Spots the shortish ball outside off and simply punches it through cover. No fuss. All boss."
350,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run opens the face as he slices the shortish ball outside off to deep third man"
351,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run rises up to get on top of the bounce of this back of a length ball outside off and blunts it well"
352,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run fullish and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
353,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run seam movement into the bat makes Kohli mistime his backfoot drive, which ends up at midwicket instead of where he was aiming (mid-off)"
354,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run deals with Cummins' bounce welll, leaping off his feet to turn the short ball on middle to midwicket"
355,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run searches for a quick single after dabbing the back of a length ball on off stump down by his feet, but point is switched on"
356,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run gets out the on-the-up drive, but doesn't quite beat cover"
357,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run misses the front-foot pull, which is bizarre because he might be the best player of that shot in the world"
358,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run plenty of pace - 143 kph - and bounce as well. Rohit has to be careful, using his wrists to pin the ball down at midwicket"
359,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run the front foot doesn't quite move as far as he'd like to make the most of this overpitched delivery - and that's entirely because Rohit is wary of the amount of bounce Cummins has been getting all evening - and the mis-hit drive finds mid-off"
360,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run presents the full face as Richardson hits a good length on off stump"
361,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run full and outside off, drives through the covers"
362,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 run he swipes at the air in anger after guiding a short ball outside off to third man and not to the third man boundary"
363,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run thumps the pitched-up delivery to mid-off. Kohli asks Rohit about whether the ball is swinging..."
364,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs just over mid-on! And only just! Rohit is usually a fine judge of when to kick on. But here, trying to force a good length ball outside off, over the leg side, he is nearly caught out. Maxwell does his best moving to his left, but in the end it lobs over him"
365,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run pushes it to cover"
366,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run swivels on the back foot as he pulls the bouncer on leg stump to long leg"
367,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 5 wide low bounce! Rohit is all set up for the pull shot, but the shortish delivery scuttles past his shins, and even beats Carey behind the stumps, which doesn't please the bowler one bit"
368,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 5 runs pitched-up offcutter outside off, Rohit drops it in front of cover point and gets the quick single. Then Maxwell's direct hit at the non-strikers' (no reasons to throw, btw, the batsman was well safe) ends up at the boundary"
369,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run gets up off his toes to turn the shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket"
370,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length and outside off, Rohit eases it to deep third man"
371,"Stoinis to Kohli, no run misfield at cover, but it doesn't really amount to much. Turner is the man in the hot seat after Kohli defends a pitched-up ball on off stump with a vengeance"
372,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run stays low but Kohli is so switched on that he's still able to glide it away from off stump and down to third man"
373,"Lyon to Kohli, FOUR runs beats short third man just as he intends to do. Lyon starts round the wicket and Kohli trusts the angle, staying back, playing the late cut, and beating Turner on his left"
374,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run stays back and whips the good length ball on middle to deep square leg"
375,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run stays back to defend a tossed up delivery, also from round the stumps, through point"
376,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run leans over the tossed up delivery outside off and knocks it down to long-on"
377,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run nudges a shortish delivery on leg stump through square leg"
378,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run both are happy to nurdle Lyon around, preferring to hang back, letting the ball turn, and deflecting it away with soft hands. Single to fine leg"
379,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run walks down the pitch and helps the back of a length delivery on off stump away to deep square leg"
380,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run shortish on off stump, Rohit turns it through square leg"
381,"Stoinis to Kohli, OUT Kohli walks too! Extra bounce does the Indian captain. You'd have expected that from one of the big scary quicks but this is Marcus Stoinis! And boy is he thrilled. A back of a length delivery outside off - ripe for the cut shot, which is what Kohli tries - gets a bit of a top edge through to the keeper. Cross-seamed variation from the Australian allrounder and it does the trick"
382,"Stoinis to Pant, 1 run back of a length, and slow too, but Pant reads it well and nudges it through midwicket"
383,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, no run covers the line of a shortish delivery outside off and nudges it to midwicket. Rohit will know he has to bat through the innings"
384,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run opens the face and steers the shortish delivery outside off to deep third man"
385,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run he's back over the wicket now that Kohli's out. Good length, outside off, Rohit blocks"
386,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run lovely bowling! There's just enough flight to draw Rohit forward, but it dips on him, drifts in, turns in too and beats the inside edge as he blocks"
387,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full on off stump, but Rohit prefers the safety of his crease, pushing the ball to long-on"
388,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run vicious cut shot, with the ball turning away from the left-hander. Single to deep point"
389,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run there's the risk in playing back. Lyon gets the good length ball to bite in the surface. The turn is quick. There is bounce too. And it forces Rohit to hurry into his block. Australia could invest in a short leg. High chance of an inside edge onto pad"
390,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run nudges the length ball to midwicket"
391,"Stoinis to Pant, FOUR runs absolutely hammers it. It's short. It's wide. It's so very juicy and Pant flays it behind point. Tons and tons of power in the shot."
392,"Stoinis to Pant, no run meets the short ball under his eyes this time since he doesn't have the room to free the arms"
393,"Stoinis to Pant, 1 run opens the face as he uses the bowler's angle across him to find a single to third man"
394,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run stays back to the length ball and neatly sends it to square leg"
395,"Stoinis to Pant, no run pitches it up on off stump, Pant blocks it"
396,"Stoinis to Pant, no run goes for the on-the-up drive but short cover is on hand to prevent the runs"
397,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run lunges forward - which is good to see - against a tossed up ball outside off and defends it"
398,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run a shade short which allows Rohit to back away and guide it through cover point"
399,"Lyon to Pant, no run loops it up from round the wicket onto middle stump, Pant defends"
400,"Lyon to Pant, no run a little drift away from the left-hander, who stretches forward to defend the full delivery"
401,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run drags his length short which allows Pant the time he needs to slice it behind point"
402,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run ties to whip a good length ball from outside off through midwicket, but the mini-helicopter doesn't quite work from Rohit. Goes straight back to the bowler"
403,"Zampa to Pant, SIX runs ah, the answers are here! Short, half-tracker, and he rocks back to wallop that over deep midwicket."
404,"Zampa to Pant, 1 run whips this nicely towards deep square, looks for the second but is sent back"

407,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 1 run drilled back to Zampa, who is struck on the finger as this deflects to long-off. Ouch, that should hurt but he ain't showing it"
408,"Zampa to Pant, no run googly which he picks and plays with the spin to mid-off."
409,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run turns this with the spin to short midwicket"
410,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run sharp turn from length outside off, defended from the crease"
411,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run gets outside the line and bunts it into the off side as they scamper a quick single."
412,"Lyon to Pant, no run allows this to drift in and bunts it gently to the off side."
413,"Lyon to Shankar, no run gets outside the line and works it with the spin to midwicket"
414,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 1 run eased with the spin too sweeper cover"
415,"Zampa to Shankar, no run nice stride forward as he defends this sharp legbreak. Appeal from Australia because they think it was pad first, but surely the impact was outside off."
416,"Zampa to Shankar, 1 run as a batsman, you can't ask for a better delivery than a long hop to get off the mark. Vijay gets hold of the pull but hits it all along the ground to deep midwicket"
417,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run chipped but just short of Zampa on the followthrough"
418,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run shortens his length, skids one through, defended back"

420,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run spins back in off a length, defended"

424,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run touch short, he makes room and punches this to deep point"
425,"Lyon to Shankar, 1 run looks to play the delicate dab, rolls towards short third man off the glove. Got too close to the delivery."
426,"Zampa to Shankar, 1 run lovely flow of the bat as he eases with the spin to long-off"
427,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 1 run jabs it away wide of Finch at cover as they steal a single to bring up India's 100"
428,"Zampa to Shankar, 1 run eased down to long-on, got nice and close to the pitch of the ball"
429,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run drifts in a full delivery, defended back to Zampa"
430,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs slices this drive towards deep point, good running as Jhye Richardson is just a split second late to move to his left"

432,"Lyon to Shankar, no run takes a step across and works it with the spin to square leg"

444,"Maxwell to Shankar, no run forced back to the bowler"
445,"Maxwell to Shankar, no run shortish on middle and leg, worked to square leg."
446,"Maxwell to Shankar, 1 run eased down to long-on as they jog the single"
447,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run bunts this wide of point and he gets to a half-century, Kotla stands to applaud. Rohit's 41st in ODIs"

449,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, no run turns this towards short midwicket"
450,"Zampa to Shankar, no run punches to midwicket"
451,"Zampa to Shankar, no run sees the flight, drills this to extra cover"
452,"Zampa to Shankar, SIX runs lofted and lofted very well, smacks the sightscreen. Didn't get to the pitch with this one but went through with the stroke and hit it right off the middle. Was hitting against the turn, mind you, but the boundary that side is not the longest."
453,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs slices this full toss towards deep point, Jadhav turns for the second but is sent back. Suspect he has been saved by a full-length dive."
454,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run beauty! Was there an edge? We'll soon find out. Spun away sharply as Rohit stabbed at this, not grabbed by the keeper. Hard to say without looking at a replay, but I suspect Rohit may have just gotten away."

459,"Maxwell to Jadhav, no run looks to work this behind square, bounces off a length to hit the thigh pad."
460,"Maxwell to Jadhav, FOUR runs rocks back and slaps this through extra cover. Superb. This was begging to be hit and Jadhav merely did that"
461,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run Maxwell has fluffed a simple chance at cover! Two drops in two overs, Rohit the recipient of slices of luck on both times. This was nice and full, he drove and failed to keep it down."
462,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 1 run gentle bunt into the off side, with the bat hitting the pad. This was a flipper from Zampa"
463,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run tucks this wide of square leg as they jog the single"
464,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run steps out but is done in nearly by the drift, Rohit gets a thickish inside edge to short fine. Played down the wrong line there"

471,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, no run steps out, nearly gets yorked so squeezes it out"
472,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run flatter one on middle and leg, nudged towards fine leg."
473,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, no run drifts in a full delivery, defended."
474,"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, OUT he's out stumped trying to play an ugly hoick, and in the process loses his bat. Zampa has run all over him. Dropped twice in as many overs, but isn't a third time lucky. Zampa sees him coming and shortens his length, Carey does brilliantly well behind the stumps because he could've been blinded by the batsman's movements for a split second. This is an outstanding stumping."
475,"Zampa to Jadeja, no run lunges forward and defends this full and flat delivery"
476,"Zampa to Jadeja, no run nice and full on the stumps, turned back"
477,"Zampa to Jadeja, OUT Gone! Huge, huge. This is a sensational delivery, drifts away and then spins to beat Jadeja's forward prod. Completely deceived by the googly, didn't read it at all. Carey grabs cleanly and whips the bails off even as Jadeja's back foot is just on the line. I wouldn't want to be Kumara Dharmasena here, if ever there's something, there may be no more than a millimeter behind. The practical decision should be out."
478,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, no run squeezes the drive to cover."
479,"Maxwell to Jadhav, 1 run tucks this down to fine leg as he jogs the single"

481,"Maxwell to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run works this behind square on the leg side to get off the mark"
482,"Maxwell to Jadhav, FOUR runs tickled and done very very nicely. Fine leg had given up. Tired effort by Khawaja. Poor ball from Maxwell"

491,"Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run bunts this down to long-on as they jog the single"
492,"Lyon to Jadhav, FOUR runs cut away beautifully, Kotla roars. Too short, made room and played it really late to beat short third man"

494,"Lyon to Jadhav, 1 run worked with the angle to deep backward square leg"

509,"Cummins to Jadhav, 1 run stands tall and punches this behind point for an easy single"
510,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs edged, races away to the third man boundary. Shaun Marsh was no more than a few yards away from the ball but he couldn't even get a hand on it. Cummins' extra pace. Bhuvi squared up as he poked, lucky runs."
511,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, no run dabs to point, looks for a single but Stoinis is quick to swoop in"
512,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, no run snorter of a short ball, Bhuvi looks to fend, is late on it as this one rolls off the shoulder of the bat to short third man"
513,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run driven on the up to deep cover"
514,"Cummins to Jadhav, 1 run short of length on middle and leg, he works this behind square to deep square."

516,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run stays back to the shortish delivery on off stump and dinks it behind square leg"
517,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run lbw appeal as Jadhav gets forward to block an offbreak outside off. Impact not in line"
518,"Lyon to Jadhav, 1 wide bowls it quick and flat on middle, but thereafter it spins well down leg. They check on the stumping, just in case Jadhav, who is well back in his crease, had his feet in the air. Nope."
519,"Lyon to Jadhav, 1 run shortish and outside off, he slices it behind point"
520,"Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run slaps a short delivery outside off back down the pitch but there isn't enough power to beat Lyon himself"
521,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run loads of turn as Jadhav, hurriedly making room to cut the ball on leg stump, only manages to find cover"
522,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run keeps out a back of a length delivery on off stump"

524,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run he's deceived by the slower ball, coming out the back of the hand. Bhuvi is looking to drive through the covers, on the up, and ends up bottom-edgging it towards mid-on"
525,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run bouncer as a follow-up, and it veers into the right-hander from outside off, coming up for his nose. Bhuvi sways away beautifully though"

529,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run loops it up outside off, Jadhav meets it with soft hands and dead bat"
530,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run steps out but Lyon doesn't give him much swinging room and with the ball pushed through flat on off stump, Jadhav can only block"
531,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run goes gung-ho, looking for the long-off boundary, but Finch does beautifully, moving to his right, despite a bad bounce right in front of him, to get the body behind the ball"
532,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run makes room to cut the ball, but it keeps low and beats him outside off"
533,"Lyon to Jadhav, no run waits for the short ball to come to him on middle and leg and picks it away through midwicket"
534,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run keeps low but Bhuvi is somehow able to protect his stumps, staying balanced in front of the wickets and flicking the ball through midwicket"
535,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run bouncer again, right over off stump, forcing Bhuvi to play, and he does, fending the ball off the bottom glove for a quick single. Good running from Jadhav. He knows he needs to take the strike to the fast bowler"
536,"Jhye Richardson to Jadhav, no run full and angling into off stump, Jadhav defends"

539,"Jhye Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run works a shortish delivery on middle through square leg"

541,"Maxwell to Jadhav, no run nudges a good length ball on off stump to midwicket"
542,"Maxwell to Jadhav, 1 run round-arms the ball into Jadhav's toes - like Jadhav himself does when he bowls - and the batsman flicks it to fine leg"
543,"Maxwell to Bhuvneshwar, no run whips a shortish delivery down the pitch, Maxwell rushes across to stop it and runs headlong into Jadhav, both men toppling over, and the coming up with the Australian hugging the Indian"
544,"Maxwell to Bhuvneshwar, no run full and outside off, defends"
545,"Maxwell to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs slices it through point! There is lovely drift on the ball but it works against Maxwell as Bhuvi gets the room to carve it away. Not perfectly timed, but doesn't need to be once he can beat the infield on a small ground like the Kotla"
546,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run oustanding pull shot, staying low, which is a good thing on this pitch, and clattering the ball that strayed into his pads to long leg"

553,"Maxwell to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run backs away and cuts the short ball outside off to the sweeper"
554,"Maxwell to Jadhav, SIX runs clears deep square leg! Well, there isn't a fielder there, so it's even better cricket. Spots the field where no man is in and slog sweeps a length ball on middle to smithereens"
555,"Maxwell to Jadhav, 2 runs quicker and flatter on leg stump, Jadhav taps it gently through midwicket, explicitly so he can get a couple of runs. The fielder is all the way on the boundary so it is perfectly calculated"

557,"Maxwell to Jadhav, no run pushes back to block a flatter delivery outside off"
558,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run hammers the half-volley on middle stump back down the pitch. Zampa gets a hand to it, but then it skips past the stumps at the non-strikers to long-on"
559,"Zampa to Jadhav, no run sexy little legbreak as Zampa loops it up above the batsman's eyeline, drawing him forward outside off, and beating his edge with dip and turn"
560,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run works it away through midwicket"
561,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, SIX runs into the crowd beyond midwicket. It's a length ball and he picks it so early, getting down on one knee and swinging away. Mighty strike"
562,"Zampa to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run flatter delivery on middle, Bhuvi goes back, opening up his body to deal with the ball skidding on straight, and whips it to long-on. Such goooooood batting."

564,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run slaps the shortish delivery outside off through to the sweeper"

566,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, no run full and angled into leg stump, Bhuvi fends it away awkwardly towards mid-on"
567,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, no run clears that front leg and goes for the flat-batted swat over the bowler's head. No contact"

570,"Jhye Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run targets the body with a short ball, Jadhav pulls down to long leg"
571,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, SIX runs launches it straight down the ground! It's the slower ball, but it's gone wrong. Hits a length, sits up to be smacked, and Bhuvi makes room and delivers big time"
572,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, no run dropped by the bowler, diving to his left. It's dying on him. It's a very very tough chance, especially in his followthrough, and after seeing the batsman play a pull shot. Wouldn't be expecting it to come his way but it does and though he responds well, diving to his left, it doesn't stick"

575,"Jhye Richardson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run dabs it down by his feet and it's Jadhav's turn to push his partner for a quick single. Richardson rushes forward to make the run-out, but the underarm throw doesn't work"
576,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs outside edge! Bhuvi does want to find the third man boundary, but this definitely goes finer than even he would have planned. The short ball at the body is Australia's plan. Bhuvi keeps making room and messing it up"
577,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide goes for the wide yorker - nails it - but it strays just a touch too far"
578,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run slower bouncer but Bhuvi is ready for it, tapping it through point"

581,"Cummins to Bhuvneshwar, no run batting so very deep in the crease, defends a fullish delivery outside off over to mid-on"
582,"Jhye Richardson to Jadhav, OUT taken at deep midwicket! There goes India's final hope, trying to pull a short ball that is a touch too close to the body for him to get any power, and just a little too much bounce for him to deal with. Tiny bit of a top edge and Maxwell on the boundary does some great work, running to his right and taking a clean catch at high pressure. Australia have been pushed to their very limit in this series, but they've foun"

600,"Stoinis to Kuldeep, 1 wide looks to slash wide of point but leaves, wide called"
601,"Stoinis to Kuldeep, 1 run clobbered, one bounce towards deep midwicket where Handscomb does well. Kuldeep wanted the second, Bumrah refused, and Kuldeep is livid. Fun to watch"

Australia's first ODI series win in India since 2009. What a win, what a performance. Massive injection of confidence ahead of the World Cup.
