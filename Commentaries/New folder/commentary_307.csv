93,"Bollinger to Hendricks, OUT Dougie does it, Hendricks drags on! The ball was short and there to pull but maybe Bollinger had rolled his fingers over it, the batsman misjudged the stroke, bottom-edged the ball on to his body and then down to shiver leg stump. Falls just short of the fifty mark, like his opening partner"
94,"Bollinger to Behardien, no run skips down the pitch and tries to heave a length ball over midwicket, swings and misses"
95,"Bollinger to Behardien, 1 leg bye leg-stump line again, aims to leg and the ball rolls away off the pad"

108,"Cummins to Miller, 1 run short, another cutter, pulled flat out towards deep midwicket"
109,"Cummins to Duminy, 1 run Cummins continues to hit the middle of the pitch and limit the pace the batsman has to use again him, swatted into the midwicket region, they think about two but the fielder is quickly in"
110,"Faulkner to Duminy, OUT tries to get to the pitch, Duminy lifts a length ball to deep midwicket! Another one goes, the SA innings is dribbling to a close... He was hitting across the line and didn't really get hold of it"
111,"Faulkner to Miller, 1 run back of a length, Miller steps away and drags one down the ground to long-on"
112,"Faulkner to Wiese, OUT gone first ball, edging a pull through to the keeper! Two in three balls for Faulkner, the slump continues. It was another back-of-a-length delivery, Wiese hadn't got his eye in and succeeded only in feathering it through to Dunk"
113,"Faulkner to Peterson, 1 run shortish, Peterson comes forward and slices a single to backward point"
114,"Faulkner to Miller, FOUR runs HEADS! Faulkner has to take evasive action here, slightly too full and Miller nearly turns killer with a scud missile of a drive straight back down the pitch. Phwoar"
115,"Faulkner to Miller, 1 run uses the feet and swings hard at a length ball, big top edge but it sails safely out towards deep cover to keep Miller on strike"

121,"Cummins to Peterson, 2 runs short, again taking the pace off, Peterson shovels it awkwardly into the leg side, deep midwicket has a lot of ground to cover and they come scrambling back for the second - still, a magnificent over from Cummins at the last"
122,"9.05pm: After a blistering opening stand of 75, South Africa managed just 29 runs from the last five overs, as Australia set up a very effective roadblock. Pat Cummins again looked the business - now the batsmen must try to seal the deal. The consensus seems to be that 145 is short of par but SA at least had an excellent tutorial in how to bowl on this"

144,"Parnell to Finch, 2 runs shuffles across and whips a couple through the leg side"
145,"Parnell to Finch, no run length ball in the channel, Finch rocks back to crash a cut shot.. straight to point. That was smoked"
146,"Parnell to Finch, SIX runs too full again from Parnell, crunched hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh into the crowd at long-on! That's the sort of stroke that makes Finch-hitting such a wonderful sight"
147,"Parnell to Finch, 1 run fullish, 138kph and Finch heaves again, inside-edges on to his front pad, they pinch one"

161,"Peterson to Watson, 1 run darted with the arm towards middle and leg, Watson flicks this away for a single"
162,"Peterson to Dunk, SIX runs tossed up, Dunk takes a couple of steps out and deposits the ball beyond the boundary, that's a shot of intent"
163,"Peterson to Dunk, OUT on the attack again - but he's hit it straight into Peterson's bread basket! Really sharp catch and he squeals in celebration... Dunk didn't get to the pitch this time, the ball maybe gripped a little and hit higher up the bat, still flew pretty quickly but Peterson was alert to grab the chance"

172,"Peterson to Watson, 1 wide fired through, down the leg side as Watson attempts to sweep"
173,"Peterson to Watson, OUT a wicket follows a wide again, Watson ballooning a drive to extra cover running back! The ball was wider than Watson would have liked, he skipped out but made a mess of trying to smash this down the ground.
