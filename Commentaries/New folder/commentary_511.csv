,Data
0,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run almost had it here, Asif finds some life off the pitch, moving it back into Katich and striking the pad via the inside edge"
1,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, 3 runs neatly done from Katich, didn't try to over-hit the ball, just pushed his hands through the line outside off and collected a three through cover"
2,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Pakistan might need to do this for a while, just try and stem the flow of runs, outside off stump, moving away a fraction and Clarke leaves alone"
3,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run high quality leave this, it pitched on off stump, and moved away and Clarke left alone"
4,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, 2 runs Asif is suckered into cricket's age-old rule, where there is movement outside off, but never from leg stump, all of which means Clarke nudges a couple through square leg"
5,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run outside off stump this time, moving away a fraction and left alone"
6,"Afridi to Katich, 1 run Afridi continues, and this is slightly better than how he started the last over, on leg stump and tickled round the corner"
7,"Afridi to Clarke, no run Clarke forward and defending, better from Afridi"
8,"Afridi to Clarke, no run Clarke skips up the wicket and defends"
9,"Afridi to Clarke, 1 run Afridi can't quite maintain a decent length it seems, this is short and Clarke is back in a flash and cutting to deep point"
10,"Afridi to Katich, FOUR runs eep, very ugly stuff from Afridi, very very short and wide outside off stump, Katich clumps it through cover for four"
11,"Afridi to Katich, 2 runs shoved full and down the leg side, Katich gloves a sweep shot down to fine leg for two more. Captain under pressure"
12,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Asif again finds the line just outside off stump, Clarke happily leaves alone"
13,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run what a good delivery this is! Absolutely cuts Clarke in half. The batsman came forward to defend it jagged back straight through him and over the top of the stumps"
14,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run big movement here from Asif, snaking away late, but Clarke is seeing it well and leaving alone"
15,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Clarke this time opts to defend, and does so very certainly, Asif is bowling a fraction short, which is unlike him"
16,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run that's a better length, but it's too far outside off stump to draw a shot from Clarke"
17,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, OUT Asif strikes! The last ball before tea, and Pakistan really needed this! It was a touch fuller, pitched in line and jagged back down the slope, Clarke was beaten by the movement as he tried to defend and this time umpire Gould gives the decision. Touch unlucky"
18,"Umar Gul to Katich, no run full outside off stump, leans into a well-timed drive but mid-off makes a good save"
19,"Umar Gul to Katich, no run outside off, keeps a fraction low and Katich stabs it into the covers"
20,"Umar Gul to Katich, 2 runs gets a leading edge on a drive which nearly goes back to Gul, but beats the out-stretched hand and beats mid-off down the ground"
21,"Umar Gul to Katich, 1 run round the wicket, worked from off stump into midwicket"
22,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone"
23,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run pushed down the leg side and the angle from round the wicket takes it further"
24,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and left alone"
25,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run well bowled, nips back off the seam from a good length and takes Katich high on the pads"
26,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, OUT gone! Asif gets another and it's a massive wicket. On off stump and late movement away from Katich which took the outside edge through to Kamran Akmal. A cracking ball. The previous one came back in, this one shaped away."
27,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run ooh, late movement from a full length and that almost took pad first which would have been plumb lbw. Well, replays show it was pad first but the appeal was very muted"
28,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run more movement, this time takes the inside edge into the leg side...nearly beat the stroke again"
29,"Mohammad Asif to North, OUT gone! What a beauty from Asif and North goes without scoring. Swung back into the left hander who played a loose drive and the ball took off stump. Great sight for Pakistan"
30,"Amir to Hussey, no run wide outside off, very full and left alone"
31,"Amir to Hussey, no run outside off and this one carries nicely through to Akmal"
32,"Amir to Hussey, 1 run on off stump and leans forward to push it into the gap at cover"
33,"Amir to Paine, no run full outside off, searching for that swing back but it goes straight on and is well left alone"
34,"Amir to Paine, no run ooh, well bowled, that moved back late and Paine defended into the leg side...dangerous to play across the front pad to Aamer"
35,"Amir to Paine, 1 wide that comes out all wrong, sprayed well wide of off stump and he'll have to bowl that one again"
36,"Amir to Paine, 1 run blimey, he was late on that, he swung sharp and late and Paine jabbed down on it...Hussey calls him through for a quick run - his first in Test cricket - as short leg tries to flick the ball back onto the stumps"
37,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, FOUR runs more swing and this time it takes the outside edge, but he played with soft hands so it runs safely between third slip and gully down to third man"
38,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run good line on off stump, defended into the covers"
39,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run outside off and left alone"
40,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run full on middle, Paine defends straight back to the bowler but was almost squared up"

42,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run fuller and closer to off stump but Paine leaves it alone again"
43,"Amir to Hussey, no run fuller and wide of off stump, Aamer just hasn't quite got his line right"

45,"Amir to Hussey, no run on the stumps, makes him play this time, and pushed back to Aamer"
46,"Amir to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone"
47,"Amir to Hussey, no run down the leg side, very wayward and he seems to striving a touch too hard at the moment"
48,"Amir to Hussey, no run another wild delivery down the leg side and Akmal does well to dive across...probably Aamer's worst over of the day"
49,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run lovely shape, outside off and curves away from Paine who watches it well and leaves alone"
50,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run on off stump, doesn't swing this time and Paine defends into the leg side"
51,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run ouch! Extra bounce on this one as it climbs off a good length and takes Paine on the gloves...that may have caused some pain (I'll get my coat)"
52,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run full outside off, trying to tempt the drive and Paine does well to resist as he leaves alone"
53,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run swings away outside off and left alone"
54,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run comes half forward and defends a full delivery to the leg side"
55,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run outside off and nicely driven through the covers but there's a sweeper out on the boundary"
56,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run that's a ripper, turns from middle stump and beats the outside edge as Paine comes forward"

60,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run driven back to the bowler"
61,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run full on off stump, a hint of that swing back into the left hander but Hussey is able to defend with bat and pad together"
62,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run nice ball outside off, seams away as Hussey leaves alone"
63,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run loses his line this time, too wide of off stump and Hussey not bothered by it"
64,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, 1 run much better, full on off stump, Hussey pushes towards mid-off who is caught on his heels and it's a quick single"
65,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, 1 run flicked off middle stump out to deep square"
66,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, FOUR runs touch too straight, Hussey picks him off through midwicket for a welcome boundary...Asif angry with himself, but we'll allow him that loose ball after this spell"
67,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run on leg stump, flicked down to mid-on"

82,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run waits for the turn and flicks it on the bounce to short leg"
83,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run into the covers"
84,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run Nearly! Paine almost chips a return catch off a very full delivery, he scooped it towards Kaneria but it landed about a foot short of him"
85,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone"
86,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run full outside off, shoulders arms again"
87,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run too wide again from Gul, he hasn't made Hussey play yet in this over"

89,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run on the stumps this time and worked out to midwicket...was a slightly fuller length, too, which is better"
90,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run dragged down short outside but Hussey doesn't time his cut and it is toe-ended into the covers"

100,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run back of a length outside off, defended into the covers"
101,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run misses out on a boundary here as he clips a leg-stump half volley, but it goes straight to midwicket...Paine can't break free"
102,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run good ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
103,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run edged, but doesn't carry to slip. Outside off and Hussey pushed forward but not quite hard enough for it to reach the fielder"
104,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run waits on the back foot and works out to deep square"
105,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, 1 run tossed up on off stump, driven to mid-off and that's a lazy single for Pakistan to give away"
106,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, SIX runs slog sweep, fetched from outside off and launches it over deep midwicket...that was more akin to his Twenty20 innings in St Lucia"

108,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run plays back and defended into the covers"

110,"Umar Gul to Paine, OUT gets this right though! Gul finally joins the paceman's party and Paine's tough debut innings is over! It was a touch quicker and it bounced a fraction more on Paine, moving away and clipping the outside edge through to Akmal, who made no mistake"
111,"Umar Gul to Smith, (no ball) gets another no ball from Gul first up, apart from that it was a good delivery, yorker that Smith just jabbed a bat down in time on"

113,"Umar Gul to Smith, no run this was a touch wide again, but not as wide as Gul's smile after he saw this bend away late, big reverse swing, which might keep things interesting"

116,"Umar Gul to Smith, 1 run Smith is away, working this to midwicket and scampering through for a single"
117,"Danish Kaneria to Smith, OUT And Kaneria wins the battle straight away! Pitched in line, it was a topspinner that squeezed between bat and pad, stuck in front, but replays show Smith got a faint inside edge, so he's unlucky. Big wicket that!"

123,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run good from Gul, full and attacking the stumps, Hussey forward and defending uneasily. Pakistan have to get him out, not gift him singles. It will be a low scoring game and Hussey can make a big difference"
124,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run the wicket might just have given Gul some confidence, he's really bounding in, finds some extra bounce and hurries Hussey into a defence"
125,"Umar Gul to Hussey, (no ball) another no ball ruins what would have been a good bouncer, forcing Hussey to sway away swiftly"

132,"Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run left alone again outside off, this is a googly though"
133,"Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run Johnson completes a hat-trick of leaves outside off"
134,"Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run top bowling this, straighter, another googly and drew Johnson into a defence, had no idea which way it was spinning and went past the outside edge"
135,"Danish Kaneria to Johnson, OUT lovely bowling! Really good to watch! The pressure built all over, Johnson had no idea what was going on, this was looped up outside off, Johnson aimed an airy drive and it spun back quickly through the gate on to the stumps"
136,"Amir to Hussey, FOUR runs while Hussey is still standing Australia will always be fighting, this was a bit of a grim half-tracker from Aamer and Hussey made no mistake, taking full advantage to crash it firmly through straight midwicket"
137,"Amir to Hussey, no run back on to a line and length now, Hussey defends"
138,"Amir to Hussey, no run it's still a touch short from Aamer, but the line is good and Hussey can only defend"

145,"Danish Kaneria to Hilfenhaus, no run wrong-un here and Hilfenhaus squeezed a defence via bat and pad"
146,"Danish Kaneria to Hilfenhaus, no run nicely played here, Hilfenhaus getting off side of the ball to defend. Kaneria has found a good rhythm here though"
147,"Danish Kaneria to Hilfenhaus, no run Kaneria probably just a bit excited, rushing his over a fraction, and this is a full toss that is patted down to mid on"
148,"Amir to Hussey, no run Aamer has got this all wrong, shoved short and well outside off stump, Hussey leaves alone"
149,"Amir to Hussey, 1 run well, Hussey takes a single, he has no problems giving Hilfenhaus the strike"
150,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, 1 run this is ideal for Australia, Hilfenhaus pushes it through gully for a single, very poor misfield"
151,"Amir to Hussey, no run touch shorter and moving away from Hussey, he defends confidently to point"
152,"Amir to Hussey, 1 run square leg is set on the boundary, which is very poor, so Hussey happily knocks it into the leg side and collects a single"
153,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, OUT the plan works! Aamer only needs one ball! It was full, swung back and through Hilfenhaus's defence to rattle off stump!"

156,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run good ball this, pushed across Hussey finds an edge that runs past slip for a couple"
157,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run oops, Hussey pushes into the leg side and sets off for two, but crashes into the generous figure of Bollinger as he runs the first one, so can only take a single"
158,"Danish Kaneria to Bollinger, no run Bollinger looks completely certain here, forward and defending like a Test opener"
159,"Danish Kaneria to Bollinger, no run no problems for Bollinger again, digging out a fuller ball - Hussey will have 250 as his first target"
160,"Amir to Hussey, no run Hussey happy to watch this go by outside off stump"
161,"Amir to Hussey, no run Hussey pushes to deep cover and doesn't take the single"
162,"Amir to Hussey, FOUR runs he's a dangerous man Hussey, dragged a fraction short from Aamer and he takes full toll, playing a controlled pull shot perfectly for four down to deep square"
163,"Amir to Hussey, 1 run this time he gets this single, pushing to deep midwicket, so Aamer will have two deliveries to finish this off"
164,"Amir to Bollinger, no run Bollinger does this well, it's full and he digs it out solidly"
165,"Amir to Bollinger, no run job done for Bollinger! At least for this over. Full toss, he pokes it to midwicket and Hussey will have six against Kaneria"

171,"Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run slightly quicker from Kaneria, Hussey gets everything behind a block and Bollinger will have to face the next over"

173,"Mohammad Asif to Bollinger, no run this is slightly closer too off stump, Bollinger pops forward and leaves alone again"
174,"Mohammad Asif to Bollinger, no run lovely delivery this, jagging back into Bollinger, the batsman managed to squeeze a bat down in time"
175,"Mohammad Asif to Bollinger, no run seaming back into the pads again, Bollinger struggling a touch but gets an inside edge on to his pads and it squirts into the off side"
176,"Mohammad Asif to Bollinger, no run thrown up well outside off, Hussey has a heart attack as he sees Bollinger have a big heave-ho at it, swishing at thin air"

227,"Amir to Bollinger, OUT not so well played! The perfect ball to a No. 11. A full inswinging yorker, clatters the pads, ricochets into the stumps, and Australia's first innings is over!"
228,"A real test for a young Pakistan batting line-up, which features two debutants in Umar Amin and Azhar Ali - about whom Andy Zaltzman has written in his latest Confectionary Stall blog. Read it at once, I implore you."
229,"So, a valuable late contribution from Bollinger, who helped Hussey add 31 for the last wicket. Will 253 be a par score? It might well be, if Australia use the conditions with anything like the same skill. Don't go away, unless it's to boil the kettle. We're all for that sort of behaviour."
230,"So, the teams are back out, and after his efforts with the bat, it will be Doug Bollinger to take the new ball. He has Imran Farhat in his sights, with three slips and a gully. Cover point, and a short leg"
231,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run outside off, a hint of movement but way wide of the stumps"
232,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run tighter to the stumps but still no stroke offered, as Farhat draws his bat inside the line"

238,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run banged in shorter, and watched through to the keeper"
239,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run good bowling, full and swinging back into the left-hander. Squeezed back down the track with bat and pad together"
240,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run more subtle inswing, defensively played again"
241,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run this one goes the other way, and there's no stroke offered"
242,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 2 runs the first runs of the innings, pushed into the covers"
243,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run pushed onto the back foot, defended down into the crease"
244,"Bollinger to Farhat, FOUR runs that's a freebie, a loose half-volley on leg stump, and Farhat nudges that off down the hill. He's away"
245,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run short again, no stroke offered"
246,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run too wide to tempt a stroke, but more signs of swing"

250,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run defended again, outside off stump"
251,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs on the pads, and flicked in the air, through midwicket. There was a fielder hovering, but he placed it well enough"
252,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run watchful defence, with a big stride forward, as Hilfenhaus attacks off stump again"
253,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run on the pads again, but can't work it away"
254,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, (no ball) forward and defended, that's the business length for Hilfenhaus. Bending into off stump"
255,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run fractionally back of a length, dabbed out to point. Solid start from Pakistan's openers"
256,"Johnson to Farhat, no run that's a good start, attacking the top of off stump at a lively pace"
257,"Johnson to Farhat, no run slightly wider of off stump, but nowhere near as wide as he was in 2009"
258,"Johnson to Farhat, no run outside off, no stroke again, as Johnson builds his rhythm"
259,"Johnson to Farhat, no run that's a good delivery, up to the bootlaces, with a hint of inswing. Defended"
260,"Johnson to Farhat, no run through to the keeper again, decent bowling"
261,"Johnson to Farhat, no run in the corridor outside off, the end of a tidy exploratory over"
262,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run outside off, through to the keeper. Australia have been tidy, but Hilfenhaus aside, they've not attacked the stumps"
263,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run too much width again, and left alone again"
264,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run too few reasons to go after the ball here. Another one sails through to the keeper"
265,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run much tighter, but still not tight enough. Good judgment and another leave-alone"
266,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run outside off again, lifting delivery"
267,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run another unthreatening over comes to an end"
268,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run width outside off, and Azhar negotiates his first delivery without fuss"
269,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 1 run he's off the mark with a cool push into the covers. A hint of outswing"
270,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run fizzed out wide, across the left-hander. Nothing doing there"
271,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run dabbed into the covers from deep in the crease"
272,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs a pokey drive, up the hill and into the hoardings. Not the most confident cover-drive of all time. But effective enough, good late wristwork to apply some oomph"
273,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run that's a ripper, nipping off the seam and past the edge"
274,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run urgently forward and pushed to cover. Good attacking length now, bringing the stumps and slips into play"
275,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run bouncer, and comfortably ducked"

291,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs outside off, opens the face and runs it through backward point...slows up over the outfield but has enough legs to cross the rope"
292,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
293,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run outside edge! Good ball with a hint of swing, Azhar plays forward but the edge doesn't carry to second slip"

299,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run wasted ball this time, dragged down really short and wide and he's lucky not to be called...that was like some of Johnson's deliveries here last year"
300,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run much better, back of a length on middle and off, Azhar is slightly opened up as he defends into the covers"
301,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs banged in short on leg stump, neatly played by Azhar as he flicks it very fine past the keeper and long leg can't get around"
302,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run fuller and outside off stump, played with a well-judged leave"
303,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 1 run full on off stump, Butt plays forward and places it into the off side for an easy single"

325,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, 1 run goes full this time, driven towards mid-off who can only half stop the ball"
326,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on off stump, skids onto Butt and he jabs it into the pitch...testing over from Johnson who is working up good pace"

328,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run defended into the leg side"

344,"Johnson to Umar Amin, no run outside off, back of a length, through to the keeper"

353,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run blocked firmly on off stump"

361,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs a touch of width, and Butt chases with hard hands, and gets away with it. A poor stroke, no foot movement and a slashing edge flies through third man. He admonishes himself for that lapse in concentration"

392,"Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs top shot...full delivery on off stump and Butt slots it between mid-off and cover with a perfect drive. That takes him to an impressive fifty off 78 balls. He needs to at least double that, though"

394,"Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs on leg stump and flicked very neatly through midwicket with enough power to evade deep square-leg who run around the boundary"
395,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run left alone"
396,"Watson to Kamran, OUT gone! Now Watson has two, what a turn up this is. And Kamran didn't even play a shot! He completely misjudged the line and went to pad up, but the ball was heading straight for middle and off. By the time he realised it was too late and Rudi Koertzen's slow finger wa"

402,"Bollinger to Salman Butt, 1 run on off stump, angled away through backward point to the sweeper and a huge cheer as it brings Afridi back on strike"
403,"Bollinger to Afridi, no run bouncer over off stump and Afridi holds himself back by ducking underneath...how boring of him (only kidding, of course)"
404,"Bollinger to Afridi, no run oh boy, now he's tried to pick this up from a good length and launch it over midwicket with a front-foot pull...doesn't make contact, but could easily have edged that or dragged it on (or hit it for six, I guess!)"
405,"Bollinger to Afridi, no run good leave, and it really was, as this one nips back from off stump"
406,"Bollinger to Afridi, 1 run worked off this hip towards where short leg was"

412,"Watson to Afridi, SIX runs that's massive! Full on off stump and Afridi drives this monstrously over mid-off. Don't think it even came quite out of the middle, but cleared the rope with ease. What a counterattack."
413,"Watson to Afridi, OUT and Watson's figures have just got even crazier! He's picked up Afridi, and I guess it was bound to happen but what a shame. It was on off stump again and he tried to repeat his drive for six, but didn't connect cleanly and slotted it straight up in the air where Joh"
414,"Bollinger to Amir, no run back of a length on off stump, Aamer plays inside the line"
