471,Shane Bond is the obvious choice for the Man of the Match. He bowled superbly right through and returned figures of 5 for 23. I've enjoyed bringing today's game to you. Keep a watch on Cricinfo for updates on Oram's finger. Thank you for all your emails and do join us on Sunday for the second ODI at Auckland. This is George Binoy signing off. Cheers!
472,"Here's another interesting fact, if Australia go on to lose the Chappell-Hadlee series, South Africa will move ahead of them as the No 1 ranked team on ODIs. It will be the first time Australia have been dethroned since the ratings were introduced by the ICC in 2002."
473,The New Zealand bowlers - Shane Bond in particular - made a difficult pitch look unplayable. The Australian batsmen were very subdued and didn't build any momentum. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming batted aggressively from the start of the chase and that made a lot of difference.
474,"It's been 22 years since New Zealand last had an opening-stand of over hundred against Australia. Australia have been defeated by ten wickets for the first time in ODI history today. They were missing five key players - Ponting, Gilchrist, Clarke, Lee and Symonds - but they have been humiliated."
475,New Zealand won by 10 wickets (with 138 balls remaining)
476,"Player of the match is Shane Bond, NZ"
