0,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs full and slid down leg and the first one of the new ball is sent packing to the fine leg boundary"
1,"Sharma to Smith, 2 runs back of a length and on the thighs as Smith works it away to fine leg again"
2,"Sharma to Smith, no run lifter on middle and leg, Smith jumps inside the line of it and leaves."
3,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs length on the pads again and it's been clipped to the square leg boundary. Easy runs these for Australia. Are India going to waste their second new ball as well. Smith raises his bat for the 63 not out as well, points to his armband as Adelaide stands up in applause"
4,"Sharma to Smith, no run fullish with a bit of curl back in on off stump, tucked to mid-on"
5,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, left alone"
6,"Shami to Marsh, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
7,"Shami to Marsh, no run good length ball on off stump, kept out"
8,"Shami to Marsh, FOUR runs short on middle with not enough pace behind it either. It was worth the attempt, but Marsh rocks back and pulls to the square leg boundary"
9,"Shami to Marsh, no run back of a length and outside off, left alone"
10,"Shami to Marsh, no run fuller delivery outside off, left alone by Marsh"
11,"Shami to Marsh, no run fuller delivery on off stump, pushed to mid-off"
12,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, pushed into the covers"
13,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, left alone"
14,"Sharma to Smith, no run shortish on off stump, pushed into the covers"
15,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run shortish on off stump and cramps him up, Smith manages to tuck it away through midwicket"
16,"Sharma to Marsh, no run fullish on off stump, pushed down the pitch"
17,"Sharma to Marsh, no run fullish on off stump, Marsh checks his stroke pushes to mid-off"
18,"Shami to Smith, no run fuller delivery on off stump, pushed down to mid-on"
19,"Shami to Smith, no run back of a length on off stump, defended down to mid-on"
20,"Shami to Smith, no run good length ball outside off, with a touch of movement away. Smith watches it through to the keeper"
21,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs banged in short and it barely rises up to his stomach, Smith pounces on it with a pull that races away to the midwicket boundary"
22,"Shami to Smith, no run fuller delivery, with some appreciable cut back in. Dangerous leave from Smith and it flicks his pad as well. Mild appeal from India, almost a plea. But it would not have hit off stump"
23,"Shami to Smith, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
24,"Aaron to Marsh, no run good length ball on middle, Marsh pushes to mid-on"
25,"Aaron to Marsh, OUT taken at gully and Kohli throws the ball high up in the air. Extra bounce gets rid of Marsh. Tight line just outside off to force the batsman to push and the variation that a new cherry provides takes care of the rest. India desperately needed that"
26,"Aaron to Lyon, no run fuller delivery on off stump, defended"
27,"Aaron to Lyon, no run bangs it in but Lyon pulls his gloves away and sways"
28,"Aaron to Lyon, no run short and wide outside off, not bothered with. Aaron's hunched over, testing his hamstring. is he cramping? He wants to continue, it would seem"
29,"Aaron to Lyon, 3 runs fuller delivery that's been met by a lovely full face of the bat from the nightwatchman. Ishant lumbers after it from mid-off, evidently tired after a very long day in the field for India's bowlers"
30,"Shami to Lyon, no run good length ball a shade outside off, Lyon judges the line well and leaves"
31,"Shami to Lyon, no run back of a length on off stump, Lyon keeps it out"
32,"Shami to Lyon, no run fuller delivery outside off, Lyon lunges forward and shoulders arms"
33,"Shami to Lyon, no run there's the outside edge, but it falls short of a diving Saha! Gets the ball to straighten off a length and because it was full enough, the batsman was drawn into a drive. Faintest of edges, but as much as Saha dived forward, he could not reach it"
34,"Shami to Lyon, no run good length ball on off stump, defended"
35,"Shami to Lyon, no run hits the back leg as he jags a back of a length delivery in off the straight. Lyon was shouldering arms, but it had struck him too high. Was in line with the stumps though"
36,"Aaron to Smith, no run good length ball a shade outside off, Smith is solidly behind it"
37,"Aaron to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, blocked"
38,"Aaron to Smith, 3 runs low full toss on off stump, tapped down the ground and the batsman jog through for a third. India showing signs of weariness"
39,"Aaron to Lyon, no run attempts a short ball, but it barely rises. And it has enough width for Lyon not to bother with"
40,"Aaron to Lyon, no run good shortish ball that. It's got good pace behind it as well and thuds into Saha's gloves as the batsman leaves outside off"
41,"Aaron to Lyon, no run fullish on off stump, Lyon is forward to block. Aaron really is not feeling well out there. Barely any followthrough"
42,"Shami to Smith, no run fullish delivery on off stump, Smith gets in line with it and adjusts for the late away movement"
43,"Shami to Smith, 1 run good length ball on leg stump, Smith nudges it through to deep midwicket."
44,"Shami to Lyon, OUT through him! Shami has made an important break. It was a good length ball targeting middle. Lyon did not move forward enough to counter the ball moving back in and it takes an inside edge, gets the top flap of the pad and hits timber"
45,"Shami to Haddin, no run fullish on off stump and Haddin is forced to play. And so he does, a little gingerly. Hint of away movement there off the pitch"
46,"Shami to Haddin, no run good length ball on and around off stump, Haddin keeps it out"
47,"Shami to Haddin, 2 leg byes goes wide of the crease and Haddin is able to work the angle to his advantage, clipped away to deep fine leg where Aaron gets a further workout. His hamstring will not appreciate that"
48,"Karn to Smith, no run tossed up on middle and Smith is down the track immediately with a flick to short midwicket"
49,"Karn to Smith, no run looped up just outside off, Smith is forward with a defensive bat"
50,"Karn to Smith, no run skips down towards a good length ball outside off and blocks"
51,"Karn to Smith, no run fourth ball over the over, third time he uses his feet to reach out to the good length ball outside off"
52,"Karn to Smith, no run gets some bounce, but Smith has judged the line well and leaves outside off"
53,"Karn to Smith, no run flighted on off stump, defended"
54,"Shami to Haddin, no run fetches the outside edge off a good length delivery just outside off. Kohli dives to his left and keeps Haddin on strike. Gets an earnest pat on the back from Vijay"
55,"Shami to Haddin, OUT there it is, India have ended the day on a high! Haddin was struggling around the off stump and this time the edge carries through to the keeper. Beautiful delivery, and that is what the new ball can do and then placing it in the right areas - on and around off stump with some late seam away"
56,"Shami to Clarke, no run smooth drive from the Australia captain as he gets forward to a fuller ball outside off. Stopped by short cover"
57,"Shami to Clarke, no run shortish on off stump, defended and walks towards square leg. A little gingerly, actually"
58,"Shami to Clarke, no run teases him in the channel outside off and Clarke has opted for an on-the-up drive as he trusts the Adelaide pitch. Just enough movement with the new ball though beats him"
59,"Shami to Clarke, no run attempted bouncer to end the over and Clarke decides not to play at it. He wanted to though, and then jerked his torso away"
60,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs terrible from India's best bowler from yesterday. Lollipop short ball with miles of width and Smith has flayed it away to the point boundary"
61,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and closer to off stump, Smith gets across to its line and blocks"
62,"Sharma to Smith, no run pushes his length fuller and a shade outside off, Smith does well not to be tempted"
63,"Sharma to Smith, no run good length ball on and around off stump, Smith matches it with a defensive blade"
64,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and just about wide enough for Smith to decide to shoulder arms very early"
65,"Sharma to Smith, no run probes a fuller length and gets the ball to straighten as it is allowed to go through to the keeper outside the off stump"
66,"Shami to Clarke, FOUR runs width again, India began like this to David Warner yesterday and have not learned. Clarke, bad back or not, cracks it through point. Hot Spot says it pinged right off the middle"
67,"Shami to Clarke, no run shortish and a shade outside off, Clarke slices it in front of point. He seems to be quite economical with his footwork, in that he doesn't want to stretch his back too much"
68,"Shami to Clarke, 2 runs sees the short ball early, and he pulls off the front foot. It comes on him a touch too quickly and at an awkward height. Gets a top edge over mid-on and he jogs through for a couple"
69,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run full and seeking off stump, Clarke backs away and guides the ball to the right of point. Beautiful timing again, if off a manufactured stroke, and Karn Sharma helps the bowler out by keeping it to a single"
70,"Shami to Smith, 1 run banged in short and Smith has loaded up on the pull far too early. Gets an inside edge that scuttles past the keeper's left"
71,"Shami to Clarke, no run presents the open face to another widish shortish delivery and finds point"
72,"Sharma to Smith, no run gets some lift outside off, but Smith has judged it well, shuffled across to protect his off stump and lets it go"
73,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs finally braves a fuller ball right at off stump and gets to see some pleasing signs. Smith was sort of falling over, wand there was a touch of gap between bat and pad as he was looking to force a drive. Gets an inside edge, which skews away to the deep square leg fence. That part might have been disheartenin"
74,"Sharma to Smith, no run trademark length from Ishant as it is shortish and outside off, defended"
75,"Sharma to Smith, no run full and close enough to off stump to make Smith push forward and block"
76,"Sharma to Smith, no run fullish and a shade outside off, Smith pushes to mid-off"
77,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs stands up tall and punches a shortish delivery to the cover boundary. Magnificent strike, power melding with possibly the text book definition of a back foot drive"
78,"Shami to Clarke, FOUR runs stand and deliver! That's mostly because he's hampered by his back, and you know what they say about injured batsman. Barely any footwork as he sways his body away from the line of a short ball and lifts it over backward point. Amazing shot."
79,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run was looking to back away, but Shami follows him and clips between mid-on and midwicket"
80,"Shami to Smith, 1 run tucked away off middle stump to deep square leg"
81,"Shami to Clarke, no run back of a length and on off stump, defended"
82,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run too full, too straight and Clarke would prefer those with his inability to move his feet too easily. Flicked to deep square leg"
83,"Sharma to Clarke, 1 run banged in short and he is heard groaning quite badly on the stump mic. Manages to pull it and though to deep square leg. Might warrant a short leg for him. He's in obvious pain. Took a long while to run for that single. Pain apparent on his face on the slow mos"
84,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, not bothered with"
85,"Sharma to Smith, no run fuller delivery outside off, invites a drive and Smith obliges. Rahane at short cover does well as well"
86,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, Smith is content to see it through to the keeper"
87,"Sharma to Smith, no run just short of a good length and outside off, Smith though has been in long enough to leave that"
88,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked"
89,"Karn to Clarke, no run jumps down the track and hits the length ball back at the bowler"
90,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run nips down and finds a run to mid-on, even if he was labouring quite badly for it. Did come down the track to help his cause"
91,"Karn to Smith, no run pulls his length back just a bit and gets a touch of drift, enough to force Smith to be circumspect as he comes down"
92,"Karn to Smith, 1 run this one is poor though. Perhaps he was afraid of the batsman coming down and slides a shorter delivery on the pads. Smith stays deep in his crease and clips to deep square leg"
93,"Karn to Clarke, FOUR runs short again, on the pads again and Clarke has swatted it away to the deep midwicket boundary. Short-armed jab that raced away"
94,"Karn to Clarke, no run wanders down the track and clips it to silly mid-on, has to hurry back to make his ground. At least as quick as he could. Wonder if he even feels 60% out there..."
95,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, Smith is not keen on fishing"
96,"Sharma to Smith, no run just short of a length and a shade outside off, Smith sizes up the line perfectly and leaves again"
97,"Sharma to Smith, no run the fuller length in a similar area outside off makes Smith come forward and block"
98,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run shortish and outside off, Smith pushes it past short cover for an easy single"
99,"Sharma to Clarke, 1 run goes for a short ball and Clarke swivels on his back foot and pulls. Controls it much better this time as he jogs a single to deep square leg. The grimace is still there though"
100,"Sharma to Smith, no run full on off stump, Smith drives to extra cover"
101,"Aaron to Clarke, no run good length ball a shade outside off, defended"
102,"Aaron to Clarke, 1 run too full and his angle pushes the ball down leg, Clarke flicks calmly to deep square leg"
103,"Aaron to Smith, no run 144kph, was it the extra pace that made the misstep? Smith goes for a flick to a full, leg-side delivery and gets a leading edge to point"
104,"Aaron to Smith, no run fuller delivery on off stump, Smith defends from the crease"
105,"Aaron to Smith, no run sublime stroke, and yet he seemed to be walking into the cover drive on the up. As exquisite as the timing was, he fails to pick the gap"
106,"Aaron to Smith, no run very brave leave from Smith as the good length ball darts back in and almost kisses off stump"
107,"Sharma to Clarke, no run the length is just not quite full enough, Clarke has read it early, realises this poses no threat to his stumps and leaves"
108,"Sharma to Clarke, no run back of a length and angled in at the batsman, Clarke trusts the bounce and leaves it almost over off stump. Only almost though"
109,"Sharma to Clarke, no run brings Clarke forward and makes him play because this was more middle and off. Inside edged to mid-on"
110,"Sharma to Clarke, no run good length ball on middle, Clarke blocks"
111,"Sharma to Clarke, no run shortish and a shade outside off, Clarke was looking to thread it through the off side and gets it off the inside edge"
112,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs too full, too far down leg and Aaron has been clipped away to the fine leg boundary. What a gift"
113,"Aaron to Smith, no run short and outside off, punched to cover"
114,"Aaron to Smith, no run full on off stump, but that strong bottom handed grip comes into play as he flicks wide of mid-on"
115,"Aaron to Smith, 1 run shortish and outside off, Smith drills it to the left of cover"
116,"Aaron to Clarke, no run not as much width, but with Clarke happy to stay leg side of the ball and the length being short as well, he is able to cut to point"
117,"Aaron to Clarke, FOUR runs how well has he done that! Swayed away from the short delivery as if he were prepped to leave it and then uses his wrists to plant an open face on the ball and lift it to the backward point boundary"
118,"Shami to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, defended"
119,"Shami to Smith, no run fullish and slanting into the pads, Smith works it to midwicket. One ball on off, the next on leg... and Kohli comes up to have a word"
120,"Shami to Smith, 1 run fuller ball on off stump, Smith works it to the right of mid-on"
121,"Shami to Clarke, no run good length ball outside off, Clarke looks to cut and gets an inside edge that deflects rather dangerously close to off stump"
122,"Shami to Clarke, no run short and wide and barely any pace on it, Shami is lucky that Clarke has picked out point"
123,"Shami to Clarke, no run good length ball outside off, Clarke bunts it to mid-on"
124,"Aaron to Smith, no run gives Smith ample time to rock on the back foot, line up the short delivery and punch to point"
125,"Aaron to Smith, no run fullish on off stump, Smith defends"
126,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs eased through extra cover and Smith is racing towards his ton. Friendly half-volley on off stump which has been duly dispatched with a lovely, straight face. His driving has improved tremendously since he started playing, especially through the off side"
127,"Aaron to Smith, no run reverts back to a shortish length and Smith blocks to cover. And now the rain is coming down quite hard"
128,"Aaron to Smith, 2 runs ton-up for Steven Smith as he tucks a simple delivery off his pads and clips it to deep square leg. Jogs away towards the '408' that's painted on the turf and raises his bat in tribute to Phillip Hughes. Big hug from Clarke, emotional scenes are Adelaide again as the crowd rises up in applause"
129,"Aaron to Smith, no run short and wide, Smith strokes it into the covers"
130,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run skips down the track and Clarke drives to mid-off to bring up the 408th run of Australia's innings. Fitting that Clarke scored it, wasn't it? Standing ovation around Adelaide"
131,"Karn to Smith, 1 run gets down the track, takes the flighted ball on the full and drills to long-on"
132,"Karn to Clarke, FOUR runs beautiful footwork from Clarke as he advances at Karn and lofts him over his head. Goes past 2000 Test runs against India with a stroke that rather defines him"
133,"Karn to Clarke, 3 runs well bowled, Karn! He's brave enough to toss the ball up and Clarke came down the pitch again. Couldn't reach it and the turn fetches his outside edge past the lone slip fielder"
134,"Karn to Smith, 1 run short and wide as well, Smith chops it through point"
135,"Karn to Clarke, FOUR runs too easy for Clarke. He'd made this ball happen by the threat he poses with his ability to dance down the pitch. Karn bowls short, the legspin offers enough room and Clarke waits just long enough to beat point in the deep"
136,"Vijay to Smith, 1 run nips down the track and Smith works it away to deep square leg. He's been doing that against the specialist spinner, why should he change against the part-timer?"
137,"Vijay to Clarke, 1 run works away past the diving midwicket fielder as he tries to reach the pitch of the ball"
138,"Vijay to Smith, no run tossed up outside off, Smith bunts it back at the bowler"

140,"Vijay to Smith, no run elegant stroke into the covers as Vijay tosses it up outside off"
141,"Vijay to Smith, no run good length ball which draws Smith forward and block with a slightly open face. The outside edge falls short of slip though"
142,"Aaron to Clarke, no run it's the bouncer first up at 139 kph, Clarke is forced to duck under it as it sails over middle and leg"
143,"Aaron to Clarke, no run top class bouncer again, this at 138 kph, and Clarke has done quite well too. Dropped his wrists and swayed his head away as the ball skirted past his ear"
144,"Aaron to Clarke, 1 run didn't quite rise up as much as Aaron would have liked and Clarke is able to pull to deep square leg. Actually it was more of a glide considering he barely hit the ball"
145,"Aaron to Smith, 1 run width offered and Smith has sliced it away to deep point. Not the ideal line against any batsman, least of all one batting past a century"
146,"Aaron to Clarke, 1 run clipped away off his thighs and picks up his 28th hundred in Tests. Clarke lifts his helmet and kisses the Australia crest. Warm appreciation from the Adelaide crowd. His average is skyrocketing here"
147,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run turns a flighted delivery into a full toss as he advances down and clips Karn, the new bowler, to long-on"
148,"Karn to Smith, 1 run leaves the crease and pushes a flighted delivery on the pads to long-on as well"
149,"Karn to Clarke, no run eases a flighted delivery to the man at cover"
150,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run turned away past midwicket as Karn flights the ball well enough, but doesn't take care of his line"
151,"Karn to Smith, FOUR runs poor ball and Smith dispatches a short and wide delivery away to the point boundary."
152,"Karn to Smith, no run flighted on off stump, defended as he strode down the pitch"

154,"Aaron to Clarke, 1 run good bouncer, got it to lift above Clarke's left shoulder and yet the batsman was able to pull it down to deep square leg"
155,"Aaron to Smith, 2 runs drills a full delivery from off stump to deep cover. Cleared that front leg and hammered it away, looks like Australia are prepping for a declaration. And Ishant's cap had fallen on the ball while he was gathering that ball up. Technically, that should be penalties, right?"
156,"Aaron to Smith, no run bouncer from over the wicket to Smith, who sways away and tries an upper cut. Can't reach it"
157,"Aaron to Smith, no run shortish on middle and leg, Smith taps it towards short midwicket"
158,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs belted back down the ground and Aaron was in terrible trouble there! Reflex made him go for a catch as Smith cleared the front leg and unleashed every bit of power he had into the strike. Deflects off the bowler to the boundary. Smith raises a hand in apology immediately. That could have been quite scary!"
159,"Karn to Clarke, no run gets down the pitch, but Karn draws the ball away outside off and the length is shorter as well so Clarke has to block"

161,"Karn to Clarke, no run flighted delivery outside off, driven to mid-off"
162,"Karn to Clarke, no run good length ball brings Clarke forward to block"
163,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run"
164,"Karn to Smith, 1 run slower through the air on middle and off, Smith goes back and works it to deep square leg"
165,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs swat! Smith was almost forward and carves a bouncer down to the long-on boundary. Umpire says one for the over as the batsman forehands it with sheer power being the only concern"
166,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs goes fuller and Smith has clocked it away to the midwicket boundary. Australia want to stick India's openers back in with the light fading in the evening. Imaging facing Mitch like that?"
167,"Aaron to Smith, no run shortish and outside off, Smith was pulling away to the leg side as well and tries an upper cut. Fails to connect and punches his bat in disappointment"
168,"Aaron to Smith, 2 runs bouncer on leg stump, but Smith is seeing the ball well enough to have loads of time to pull to fine leg. Shami was the man who pulls out a timely boot"
169,"Aaron to Smith, FOUR runs the umpire better watch out. Aaron might be asking his captain to take him off judging by the danger of these flat-batted missiles Smith is directing down the ground. How does a short ball end up there?"
170,"Aaron to Smith, 1 run full toss on leg stump, whipped away to deep square leg. This is overdrive and how!"
171,"Karn to Smith, no run missed stumping by Saha. Beautiful flight from Karn even as the batsman was dancing down the track and with Smith in this mood, wanting to slog everything, he plays against the turn and survives as Saha barely tracked the ball."
172,"Karn to Smith, 1 run flighted outside off, eased down the ground with a beautifully straight bat"
173,"Karn to Clarke, no run"
174,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run nips down the track and drives to long-off"
175,"Karn to Smith, no run shortish and outside off, chopped towards point"
176,"Karn to Smith, 1 run stays back, rises with the bounce and punches the ball to deep cover"
177,"Shami to Smith, no run a touch slower at 131kph, Smith was set up for a crack through cover but had to adjust and find cover"
178,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs shortish and outside off, steered past the diving gully fielder. Dhawan was the culprit who gives away a boundary"
179,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs he is in supreme form! This was a full delivery seeking the base of middle stump, and Smith has given the bowler a full view of it. As if to tease him, and then unveils a stunning cover drive. Hits the gap and roars to the fence"
180,"Shami to Smith, no run wide of the crease and the short ball on off stump has been slid to gully"
181,"Shami to Smith, 1 run gets across on off stump and tucks a fuller ball through to deep midwicket"
182,"Shami to Clarke, FOUR runs short and wide, Clarke was backing away to try and cut and has to eventually reach out. Gets a thick edge through slip and gully. And with that shot another shower arrives"
183,"Karn to Smith, no run tossed up on leg stump, opts for a sweep but can't quite connect"
184,"Karn to Smith, 1 run shortish and on the pads, nudged away through midwicket"
185,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run goes back and across and clips a flatter delivery from off stump to deep midwicket"
186,"Karn to Smith, 1 run loopy delivery on middle, Smith has nailed the sweep this time. Brought the bat down on top of the ball and middled it to deep square leg"
187,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run tossed up outside off and Clarke has eased it to the sweeper on the off side"
188,"Karn to Smith, 1 run swept behind square by Smith as this is flighted on the pads"
189,"Shami to Smith, 2 runs worked away off his knees and deep fine leg has to run a long way to his left to catch up with it"
190,"Shami to Smith, 1 run it's been quite profitable for him and he continues weaving that front leg aside and slices a short ball outside off to deep point"
191,"Shami to Clarke, no run banged in short, perhaps a bit too much so which allows Clarke ample time to get under it"
192,"Shami to Clarke, no run goes around to Clarke and delivers a short ball on middle. Clarke blocks it by his feet"
193,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run persists with the short-pitched line of attack and pulls to deep midwicket"
194,"Shami to Smith, no run well bowled. He's trumped Smith's efforts to open up the off side and cart him away. Finds the blockhole and keeps Smith to a defensive push to mid-off"
195,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run comes down the track to slog over cow corner, odd stroke for Clarke to be playing, but the situation demands it. Inside edge skews to fine leg"
196,"Karn to Smith, no run flighted and drifting on middle and off, Smith looks to hack it to fine leg as he brings down a straight bat on top of the ball and shovel it behind him"
197,"Karn to Smith, no run flighted on leg, Smith sweeps powerfully finds square leg"
198,"Karn to Smith, no run tossed up on leg stump and Smith was trying to make room to open up the off side. Finds a yorker on leg and has to dig it out. Very awkwardly. Barely managed to stay standing"
199,"Karn to Smith, no run good length ball on leg stump and turning away, Smith's sweep is of no use this time"
200,"Karn to Smith, no run reverse this time and it tickles off the glove and could easily have knocked over the off stump"
201,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run back of a length and outside off, opens the face to run it to deep point"
202,"Shami to Smith, 1 run short and wide, slapped to the man square on the off side boundary"
203,"Shami to Clarke, no run back of a good length on off stump, and Shami's bowling around to Clarke, defended"
204,"Shami to Clarke, 1 run goes for a short ball on middle and Clarke isn't as fluent as his normal self. He's still tucked up despite moving across outside off and just about deflects it down to fine leg"
205,"Shami to Smith, 1 run short and a shade outside off, Smith pulls it behind square leg and brings up his maiden 150 in Tests"
206,"Shami to Clarke, no run full and on the pads, Clarke though prefers to go back and clip to short midwikcet"
207,"Karn to Smith, no run flighted on leg stump and spinning further away, which makes the sweep a difficult stroke. Misses it"
208,"Karn to Smith, 3 runs moves away outside leg to try and carve the flighted ball from well outside leg over the covers. Gets a thick outside edge that flies to Kohli's left at slip. Too tough a catch to pull off and Clarke pushes himself to get three"
209,"Karn to Clarke, 2 runs lap swept towards fine leg for a single"
210,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run goes back and clips a shortish delivery through square leg"
211,"Karn to Smith, no run slower through the air and flighted on the rough, goes for a sweep but can't pull it off from this angle"
212,"Karn to Smith, 1 run good length ball on off stump, steered behind point"
213,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run one bounce to deep midwicket! It was length, it was the kind of ball that early on in a Test might have been blocked but Smith and Australia are chasing a declaration so it has to be slogged away"
214,"Sharma to Clarke, no run good short ball from Ishant, rises over Clarke's left shoulder and goes on to the keeper"
215,"Sharma to Clarke, no run mid-on and midwicket chase after a leading edge, Rahane from mid-on dives and tries his hardest to get his hands under it. But just as it had lobbed over Pujara, it drops short of Rahane"
216,"Sharma to Clarke, no run short and slid down leg, Clarke does not bother"
217,"Sharma to Clarke, 1 run moves outside leg and negotiates a shortish ball off his hips to deep square leg"
218,"Sharma to Smith, 5 wide saw the batsman backing away down leg, Ishant went further past him and the keeper cannot save him the blushes. Five wides raise the 500 of the Australians as ishant looks at his hand in disbelief"
219,"Sharma to Smith, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
220,"Karn to Clarke, FOUR runs how clean was that. Perfect example of how fast his feet are and then once he was to the pitch of the ball, straight batted it through mdiwicket!"
221,"Karn to Clarke, 1 run tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
222,"Karn to Smith, 2 runs if the orthodox sweep doesn't work, try the reverse. Drags a fuller delivery from way outside leg to deep third man"

224,"Karn to Clarke, no run short on leg stump, nudged to square leg"

226,"Sharma to Smith, no run tries to swing off his feet against a length ball on off stump and inside edges it onto his thigh pad"
227,"Sharma to Smith, 2 runs does away with the front leg and creams a length delivery to deep midwicket. He's stopped looking pretty now, but his threat is still very sound"
228,"Sharma to Smith, no run good length ball slanted at Clarke even as he was backing away. Can't connect with the flick"
229,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run banged in short and Smith has pulled it to deep square leg"
230,"Sharma to Clarke, FOUR runs front-foot pull from Clarke beats midwicket and then rushes away to the boundary after that. Chin scratching time, and has been for quite a bit for Kohli"
231,"Sharma to Clarke, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
232,"Karn to Smith, 1 run Ishant has dropped it. Not that this ball deserved a wicket as Karn bowls length on leg stump and is swept quite powerfully. Deep fine leg has misjudged it though and stayed back when he should have come forward. Ball drops short of his dive"
233,"Karn to Clarke, OUT no mistake this time. Clarke goes for a sweep and has found square leg. Adelaide stands up to appreciate their captain. The coach pats him on the head as he walks back, his family is there as well. Looks quite weary as he walks off."
234,"Karn to Johnson, no run good length ball a shade outside off, defended"
235,"Karn to Johnson, no run flighted on middle and Johnson comes forward to block"
236,"Karn to Johnson, no run moves around the wicket and targets the rough with a good length ball and keeps Johnson to a defensive push"
237,"Karn to Johnson, no run a shade short which prompts Johnson to go back and cut. Too much spin for him to pull the shot off"
238,"Steven Smith has continued making a name for himself in Test cricket, and at times batted like he was two different people. A polished strokemaker for much of the innings and then a slog-overs specialist in the latter half. Michael Clarke strode out at the start of the day, back injury and all, and his sudden appearance seemed to have wilted"
239,"It's been 30.4 overs, Australia have hammered 163 runs and India's bowlers did not look like they could change the tide. As is usual for Adelaide which has the highest average for first and second innings scores since 2000. For further analysis, do tune in to Match Point with Stuart MacGill and Ajit Agarkar."
240,5.55 pm The umpires have decided to call stumps. The light seems to have deteriorated too much for play to continue it would seem. We will look to compensate for the play that's been lost today with an early start tomorrow and possibly for the remaining days of the Test as well. So do join us tomorrow at 10.00 am when play will begin.

250,"Harris to Rahane, 2 runs invites the drive through the off side and Rahane's timing is alive and kicking. Johnson goes for a slide and parries the ball away to gift a couple"
251,"Harris to Rahane, FOUR runs short and wide, Rahane was waiting for it. Camped on the back foot and crashed through point. Lyon was the man diving to his right, slaps the turf in frustration"
252,"Harris to Rahane, no run lands the yorker on off stump and it's dug out"
253,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run shortish and outside off, pulled and kept down to deep square leg. He was on the front foot as well. Looks like Kohli's not troubled by the pace anymore"

260,"Lyon to Kohli, no run goes back to a good lengt hball and taps it to short leg"

268,"Siddle to Rahane, 1 wide banged in way too short and Rahane barely even had to duck. Umpire Erasmus says that was too high"
269,"Siddle to Rahane, FOUR runs what a lovely punch! It was a 118 kph delivery which was short and wide as well. Rahane stood up tall behind it and powered it away with his bottom hand."

271,"Siddle to Rahane, no run gets up with a short ball and taps it past gully and searches for the single that would bring him another Test fifty, but Kohli is not too keen. Think there was a single there, really"

273,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run flighted on off stump, nudged to mid-on"
274,"Lyon to Rahane, 1 run goes back and rides the bounce on a shortish delivery through point and gets the single he needs for his fifty. And it's been an eventful one"

276,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run flighted outside off and Kohli leans forward to work the ball with the turn to wide mid-on. All the batsmen have run between the wickets strikingly well"

280,"Smith to Kohli, 1 run flighted on off stump and Kohli stays leg side of the ball to drive inside out through the covers"
281,"Smith to Rahane, no run he's hit his length now. Beautiful flight on the ball as it drops on middle and Rahane comes forward to block"
282,"Smith to Rahane, 3 runs short and wide now, so Rahane has backed away and slapped it through extra cover. Chris Rogers has a lot of distance to cover to his left, pulls out a desperate dive and seems to have flicked the ball back. Has he? Yep! Top work"

307,"Smith to Kohli, no run goes back to a fullish delivery but is able to punch to the ball to short leg"
308,"Lyon to Rahane, no run appeal for a catch at short leg, but there wasn't any bat involved. Acrobatic effort from Warner there as he leaps high to his left and clings on"
309,"Lyon to Rahane, OUT unplayable! That leaped up off a good length and Rahane, having gone back to block, is thoroughly stunned. he does not know where the ball went after taking his glove. and finally realises he is caught by slip running to his left.

324,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run tossed up on off stump, Rohit closes his face a bit too early and gets an outside edge. But he was playing with soft hands"
325,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run flatter and quicker on middle, Rohit is back to block"

327,"Watson to Kohli, no run full and straight, flicked away to midwicket"

329,"Watson to Kohli, no run opens the face against a shortish ball outside off and runs it down towards point. Uncertainty between the two new partners, who are often prone to run-outs, means they take the safer route and decide against the single"

334,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs swept from well outside off and he's found the gap between fine leg and square leg. He does time the ball quite well, so I guess that's what happened because he barely hit it"

346,"Johnson to Kohli, 2 runs width on offer and Kohli has slapped it through the covers. Not quite enough room for him to play that shot, which is why he mistimes it"
347,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs this time off the back foot and that's the second boundary off the over. Kohli did say India would handle Johnson and he is leading the way.

360,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run 142kph, another short ball, this one better directed and the pace is up as well. Kohli has to leap off the turf and tuck it through square leg"
361,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs leans into a checked drive and his gift of timing allows him to collect a couple of runs through the covers. Too full and wide from Johnson"

368,"Harris to Kohli, no run short of a length and outside off, kept out"

393,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run huuuuge appeal as Rohit hides his bat behind pad. But umpire Gould shakes his head. Had a big stride and perhaps the turn might have taken it down leg. And there was a puff of dust as well. Oh, HawkEye says it would bounce over the top of middle"

395,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs jumps down the track, turns a flighted ball into a full toss and lifts it over the top of the bowler. Wonderfully batting"

404,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run looped up outside off and he lunges forward to pad up and weathers a particularly strong appeal.

It's the bouncer again, it's on middle, it came at the batsman too early and the top edge swirls to Ryan Harris who rushes in and dives forward to take it. The front-foot check looks scary, but Johnson has a couple of millimeters behind the l"
422,"Johnson to Saha, no run welcomes him with a bouncer that hits Saha on the gloves even as he was trying to sway away from the line. Johnson looks to be back. Did not give the batsman anything to work with and Saha did well to pull the bottom hand off and ensure it falls by his feet"

431,"Lyon to Saha, no run presses forward to block outside off and the turn takes the inside edge down the pitch"
432,"Lyon to Saha, 1 run four men around the bat, and one of them was in business. Saha was itching to get off the mark as he leans forward and clips the flighted ball past short leg. It went uppishly as well"
433,"Johnson to Saha, no run yorker outside off, Saha digs it out"
434,"Johnson to Saha, no run 141kph, good length ball on the stumps, Saha defends gingerly"
435,"Johnson to Saha, no run sees the short ball early and Saha arches himself back and away from the line of the ball. Love that he always keeps his eyes on the ball and doesn't turn his back on the bouncer"
436,"Johnson to Saha, no run back of a length and outside off, let through to the keeper"
437,"Johnson to Saha, no run banged in short and at the body - quite an acute angle, actually -, Saha veers away and realises he also has to pull his bottom hand off the bat. Brilliant leave"
438,"Johnson to Saha, no run back over the wicket, Saha pushes it to cover and the umpires call time"
439,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run perfect line with just enough cut back in at Rohit and he is in a spot of bother while trying to tuck the ball to midwicket"
440,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run some inswing on offer for Harris, as there was last evening as well. Rohit leans forward and drives with an open face into the covers"
441,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run jams a yorker on off stump, and it's threat is enhanced with some inward movement as well. Rohit plays late and digs it out"
442,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs that tail in began off a straighter line this time and Rohit is able to clip it behind square leg. Well played"
443,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run holds its line this time! Lovely set up from Ryano, and he'd have been pleased with Rohit poking with an open face without moving his front foot across. Only thing missing for the bowler was the outside edge"
444,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run the sound that excites the Aussies was bat hitting pad as Ryano straightens a fuller delivery on fifth stump and beats Rohit again. Haddin didn't appeal though"
445,"Johnson to Saha, no run fuller delivery armed with the left-armer's angle across, Saha does not bother with it"
446,"Johnson to Saha, no run full on off stump, Saha blocks it into the covers. But gee, that bat takes a beating when the Johnson-powered ball strikes it"

448,"Johnson to Saha, 3 runs hint of movement away and it lures Saha's outside edge off a drive that was intended into the covers. Beats Warner in the gully and they snare three before second slip catches up with it"

454,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, 1 run punched to mid-off and Rohit makes it across to the other end. Australia are exploring a lovely, fuller length again"
455,"Harris to Saha, no run back of a length and outside off, Saha's judgment is top class. Covers his stumps and leaves it outside his eyeline"
456,"Harris to Saha, no run fuller delivery outside off brings Saha forward to block"
457,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run strays into the overpitched area with his length and Rohit drives to cover"
458,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run good length ball outside off, Rohit will not bother with it"
459,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run loooose! Johnson teases out the poke from Rohit outside his off stump, but cannot get the outside edge. Are they feeding India's batsmen with drivable balls so that they'd err when the good length comes down?"
460,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run shortish on off stump, Rohit stands up tall to drop the ball into the off side with soft hands and races off to the other end"
461,"Johnson to Saha, no run back of a length and only a shade outside off, Saha trusts the angle from the left-armer and the bounce on this pitch and leaves"
462,"Johnson to Saha, no run another short ball pushed across Saha, doesn't lure him into playing this time either"
463,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run good length ball outside off brings Rohit across to block, the sound of bat hitting pad tempts an appeal. Should be tighter there"
464,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run fullish on off stump and that's when Rohit should come forward and push down the ground, as he does"
465,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run good length ball at 143kph outside off, Rohit leaves wisely"
466,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run full on middle, Rohit nudges to short midwicket"

469,"Johnson to Saha, no run pushes Saha back with a 142 kph short ball on off stump that gets a lot of clapping from Clarke and the Australia fielders. Defended"
470,"Johnson to Saha, no run stays beside the shortish ball and punches it into the covers"
471,"Johnson to Saha, no run seeks the yorker on off stump, at 139 kph, Saha bunts it down to mid-off"

473,"Johnson to Saha, no run 141kph fullish on off stump, Saha defends quite solidly"
474,"Johnson to Saha, no run makes him jump off his toes to negotiate this shortish delivery on off stump at 141 kph. The accuracy this morning has been something special"
475,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run ducks back in off the pitch and Rohit manages an inside edge onto his thigh. Ryno creating some nerves"
476,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, no run fuller delivery outside off, Rohit drives to mid-off"
477,"Harris to Rohit Sharma, 1 run banged in short and Rohit has to drag it from outside off with his hook, off the front foot as well. Not in control of the stroke and it was played purely on instinct. Top bowling"

479,"Harris to Saha, no run another bouncer outside off, Saha sways away"

481,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR runs juicy full toss outside off, Saha throws his bat at it and picks up the first boundary of the morning through extra cover. Almost seemed surprised by the run-scoring opportunity, but managed to capitalise"
482,"Johnson to Saha, no run full and outside off, Saha taps it to mid-off"
483,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR runs beautiful stroke from Saha. He's looked sharp on the front foot this morning and this was overpitched outside off. Driven sweetly through cover"
484,"Johnson to Saha, no run back of a length and outside off, left for Haddin"
485,"Johnson to Saha, no run back of a length on leg, Saha tucks it to mid-on"
486,"Johnson to Saha, no run teases him outside off with the fuller length, Saha is wary of the threat and lets it go to the keeper"
487,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run swept first ball to deep square leg. Picked it off a length, he should be careful in case there is some extra bounce"
488,"Lyon to Saha, no run a touch short and way outside off, but the rip in makes the ball threaten middle stump and Saha punches to cover"
489,"Lyon to Saha, no run tossed up on a length, Saha goes back and works it to short fine leg"
490,"Lyon to Saha, 2 runs a bit more bounce than Saha expected as he rocked back to try and cut from the stumps, but he adjusts, softens his hands and runs it down to third man"

493,"Siddle to Saha, no run fuller delivery on off stump, defended to short midwicket"
494,"Siddle to Saha, no run opts for a short ball and Saha's spotted it early. Sinks to his knees, drops his wrists and he needed to do so because the ball doesn't bounce too much. Beautiful technique again"
495,"Siddle to Saha, no run back of a length on off stump, Saha defends and almost had to adjust. He's been playing balls at over 140kph, and this was 132 kph"
496,"Siddle to Saha, 3 runs gorgeous! It was a touch too full and the curl on only helps Saha as he taps the ball down the ground and times it away for three runs. Making a case for his own Game Plan video"
497,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length and outside off, Rohit prefers to block off the front foot"
498,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run cuts back in quite sharply off a good length and Rohit defends. Just about"
499,"Lyon to Saha, no run goes back to a good length ball and turns it away past short leg's left"
500,"Lyon to Saha, 1 run a bit short and his footwork is quick enough to push him back, get beside the ball and punch through point"
501,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run tossed up outside off to bring Rohit forward and block. Lovely line and length from Lyon"
502,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs jumps down the track and lofts Lyon over mid-on. Sparkling footwork from Rohit as he reaches the pitch and then swings his hands through the line. Very good stroke"
503,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, OUT he's caught it! What a soft dismissal! It was a loopy delivery outside off and Rohit has come down the track to try and nudge it away. But all he's managed is return the ball back into the bowler's hands. Lyon had to dive to his right off his followthrough and just about holds on. Australia badly wanted that"

511,"Lyon to Saha, 1 run jumps back to a shortish ball and slices it behind point. There was another run on offer, but Karn wasn't ready for it"
512,"Lyon to Karn, no run huge appeal from the bowler as he sees the ball leaps past the outside edge. Haddin did not go up, so that was a giveaway. Bat hitting pad was the noise"
513,"Lyon to Karn, no run flighted outside off and Karn goes for a whippy drive through the covers and is beaten again. Beautiful bowling from Lyon, looping it up, luring the drive and deceiving him"
514,"Lyon to Karn, no run beaten outside off again"
515,"Lyon to Karn, 1 run closer to off, he gets bat on it, a thick outside edge, wide of cover for a single"
516,"Siddle to Karn, no run he's shouldered arms to a straight ball! Siddle launches into an appeal and it looked very very close as well. Perhaps the ball might have just snaked down the off stump. And it pitched outside leg Hit the top flap of the pad and Erasmus is right"
517,"Siddle to Shami, FOUR runs cracked behind point as he stays beside the line of a shortish delivery and his hands are quick enough to produce a rather eye-catching boundary. Makes Siddle smile broadly."
518,"Siddle to Shami, 3 runs fullish on middle and Shami just about manages to get an outside edge. He prefers to stay leg side of the ball again"

520,"Siddle to Saha, no run defended into the off side"
521,"Lyon to Shami, no run tossed up outside off and Shami reaches out to block. Tailender against the turning ball"
522,"Lyon to Shami, 2 runs runs down the track and swings all across the line against a length ball. Would have been stumped by miles had the inside edge not connected, and it wasn't too far away from the short midwicket fielder either"
523,"Lyon to Shami, no run flighted outside off, lunges forward and blocks"
524,"Lyon to Shami, no run looped up outside off, nudged into the covers"
525,"Lyon to Shami, FOUR runs dropped and six, is it? It was a huuuuge mis-hit. Shami has decided he cannot survive just defending and has launched the ball into the deep midwicket region. Siddle is the man there, backtracking with the reverse cup but it bursts through, goes off the brim of the cap and into the boundary on the bounce"
526,"Lyon to Shami, no run flighted outside off, defended"
527,"Siddle to Saha, no run fullish on off stump, pushed back at mid-off. Solid straight face"

533,"Lyon to Saha, no run good length ball on off stump, nudges to short leg"
534,"Lyon to Saha, no run waits on the length ball and works it from off stump to short fine leg"
535,"Lyon to Saha, OUT he's gone! Lyon keeps troubling everyone. But did it hit the bat? It was a gorgeous offspinner that brought the right-hander forward to block. The turn beats his inside edge, hits the pad and umpire Gould must think it kissed the glove on the way to first slip. I didn't see anything though..."
536,"Lyon to Sharma, no run tossed up outside off, defended"
537,"Lyon to Aaron, no run flighted outside off, Aaron looks to drive towards mid-off and is kept quiet by the turn"
538,"Siddle to Shami, 2 runs fuller delivery on off stump, Shami goes for a loft over mid-on and barely times it. The ball balloons off the closed face and Clarke makes a terrific one-handed attempt. Runs, dives to his left but it just about evades him"
539,"Siddle to Shami, no run searing yorker on leg stump, keeps it out quite well."
540,"Siddle to Shami, no run length ball outside off, clears front leg like Steven Smith but he can't connect with the ball like Steven Smith"

542,"Siddle to Shami, 3 runs over the keeper! It was the short ball and Shami has loaded up for the pull a little late though. Manages to place it at no-man's land around fine leg"
543,"Siddle to Aaron, no run fuller ball on off stump, Aaron steps forward and defends quite solidly"
544,"Lyon to Shami, FOUR runs runs down at Lyon and Shami has managed to nail this! He didn't quite get to the pitch, but I don't think that's a priority for Shami right now. He had enough room and so he capitalised"
545,"Lyon to Shami, 1 run runs at him again and swings off his hips. Runs down to deep midwicket"
546,"Lyon to Aaron, 1 run nips down the track and lifts the ball over Lyon's head"
547,"Lyon to Shami, 2 runs down the track again and he lofts Lyon inside out over the covers"
548,"Lyon to Shami, 1 run shortish and turning down leg as Shami belts it to deep square leg"
549,"Lyon to Aaron, 2 runs whacked down the ground after the tailender jumps down the ground. Mid-off manages to catch up with it and that's three runs"
550,"Siddle to Shami, no run fuller delivery on leg stump, Shami allows a clean line of sight at the stumps and denies Siddle with a straight bat"
551,"Siddle to Shami, SIX runs short delivery on off stump and Shami has slammed it miles over midwicket. He's no longer afraid of Siddle's pace, not when it sits up like that. Mitchell Marsh was on the boundary. But it lobbed him"
552,"Siddle to Shami, no run full and outside off, Shami loads up for another slog without any footwork and misses extravagantly"
553,11.35 am Australia have earned a 73-run lead after an hour and a half's worth of good work this morning. Nathan Lyon was going to be key with the Adelaide pitch roughing up. He's claimed three of the five wickets that fell today and has looked immensely impressive. India's bowlers will need to show they've settled down from the first-innings
554,Innings Start
555,"Shri: ""As India gets to 100, can't help but think that throughout this game, India has lost one more wicket than they should have (100/1 at lunch was good, 100/2 is Australia's session). I think this is going to prove one wicket too many in the end."""
