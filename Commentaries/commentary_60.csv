435,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, no run shorter length, he stands tall and punches back to the bowler"
436,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, 1 run short and wide, he late cuts nicely but straight to the man at wide third man"

440,"Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, 2 runs short length and he cracks a pull shot forward of square this time for two more"
441,"Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, FOUR runs edged and it flies wide of Carey! This was a good delivery, tempting the drive but it was not that full, a genuine outside edge and it's well wide of the diving keeper and races to the fine third man rope!"
442,"Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, no run shorter length, he's back and whipping this powerfully to midwicket but can't beat the fieldsman"

453,"Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 1 run back of a length outside off, he runs this to third man"
454,"Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, 1 run almost run out by a Maxwell direct hit! He dabbed it to point and point and took off, Maxwell swooped to his right, wrong man to take on, he fired at the non-striker's and just missed! Abid was short of his ground as he dived"
455,"Zampa to Abid Ali, no run slid through on off, he defends from the crease"
456,"Zampa to Abid Ali, no run huge LBW appeal. Not out. Did he hit it? No review from Australia. It looked close as he tried to pull a straighter ball"

463,"Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run tapped close in on the leg side but into the gap, and they run a quick single"
464,"Lyon to Rizwan, no run beaten on the slog sweep and Carey has the bails off in a flash. It doesn't look like his back foot left the crease, and Rizwan rolls onto his back to have a stretch after missing the shot. A spot of cramp, perhaps? But he's good to go"
465,"Lyon to Rizwan, FOUR runs another sweep, and he lays a good chunk of bat on this one and places it nicely behind square to collect another boundary and push Pakistan forward"
466,"Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run tossed up on off stump, delivered from around the stumps, and it's squirted into a gap at cover for a quick single"
467,"Zampa to Rizwan, 1 run there's the sweep again, and he connects well but the fielder is in position to stop it - and this is now Pakistan's highest third wicket ODI stand against Australia"
468,"Zampa to Abid Ali, no run pushed through by Zampa, and Abid misses the ball as he flicks across his front pad. It looked like it might be headed down the leg side, and Umpire Dharmasena turns the appeal down. Australia reckon he's out - or at least hope so - and they ask for a review. Two reds and an umpire's call on the ball tracker! So Abid survives, on 98"
469,"Zampa to Abid Ali, 1 run and he's up to 99 now, glancing through square leg for one"
470,"Zampa to Rizwan, no run down the track comes Rizwan, and he slams a drive back at Zampa"

472,"Zampa to Rizwan, no run Rizwan jumps down the track, but Zampa adjusts his length and he can only defend"
473,"Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run there it is! A hundred on debut for Abid Ali. He's playing his first international at 31, and he wasn't even supposed to be playing today. And now he's become the third Pakistani to score a hundred on his ODI debut"

476,"Lyon to Rizwan, no run tapped back to the bowler"
477,"Lyon to Rizwan, FOUR runs wristed to wide long on! Rizwan uses his feet to get close to it, once again using those powerful wrists to fetch the ball powerfully into the leg side. It's perfectly placed too"
478,"Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run Lyon offers width, but it's just a single out to the sweeper"

483,"Zampa to Abid Ali, FOUR runs clears the left leg, and this time he nails the slog sweep, right into the gap"
484,"Zampa to Abid Ali, no run three slog sweeps in a row, but he can't lay a bat on this one. Carey whips the bails off, and there's an appeal ... but it's for caught behind! The umpire says no, so Australia go upstairs for a review. But there's nothing on UltraEdge, so the decision will stand"
485,"Lyon to Rizwan, no run pushed back to the bowler"
486,"Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run Rizwan skips out and sends a drive skimming to cover, where it's stopped by Finch - but not quickly enough to stop the single"

488,"Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run Rizwan fetches a sweep from outside off, another quick single"

490,"Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run slapped through cover, one more"
491,"Zampa to Rizwan, 1 run"
492,"Zampa to Umar Akmal, no run he comes forward and checks a drive to cover, who gets low to stop it"

495,"Zampa to Umar Akmal, 1 run too short again, and Umar's off the mark with a pull out to deep midwicket"
496,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, 2 runs a nicely-placed cut bounces out to the deep, behind square, and they're back for a second"

502,"Coulter-Nile to Saad Ali, 2 runs enter Saad Ali, who is also on his debut. He's off the mark straight away, nudging off his pads and calling Rizwan through for a hard-run two"
503,"Coulter-Nile to Saad Ali, no run chopped down through gully, but Maxwell dives at backward point to stop the run"
504,"Coulter-Nile to Saad Ali, 1 run angled, but finer this time, and there's an easy single to third man"
505,"Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 1 run Coulter-Nile aims full, and it's dug out through mid on"
506,"Coulter-Nile to Saad Ali, no run full and straight, Coulter-Nile stopping it in his follow through as it's pushed back at him"
507,"Maxwell to Rizwan, no run appeal for lbw as Rizwan misses a sweep and his hit on the pad, but the umpire's not convinced. Maxwell floated that one up really high"
508,"Maxwell to Rizwan, 1 run flatter, shorter, and it's punched through cover"
509,"Maxwell to Saad Ali, 1 leg bye another appeal! Saad is hit on the pad as he looks to glance, but it looked like the ball was headed down the leg side anyway"
510,"Maxwell to Rizwan, no run a late cut sends the ball bouncing to backward point"
511,"Maxwell to Rizwan, 2 runs chopped hard through cover, and there's an immediate call for two. It's a good call, and they're back safely"
512,"Maxwell to Rizwan, 1 run another sweep, and Zampa fumbles his stop at short fine leg ... but they opt not to run off the misfield"
513,"Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 1 run glanced to midwicket, into the gap"
514,"Coulter-Nile to Saad Ali, 1 run Saad steps into a crunchy drive, and he wants two but he's sent back. It would have been very tight"

519,"Maxwell to Saad Ali, 1 run punched down the ground for one"
520,"Maxwell to Rizwan, 2 runs Maxwell lobs a full one up on a leg stump line, from around the wicket, and Rizwan sweeps down to fine leg. It's placed well enough for a second run. Quick running"
521,"Maxwell to Rizwan, FOUR runs paddled fine, and Pakistan find a vital boundary! Maxwell fired this one in quicker, but Rizwan was waiting for it with another paddle sweep, getting it fine of Zampa and hitting it well enough for the ball to beat him to the boundary"
522,"Maxwell to Rizwan, 1 run he's down the track to get to the pitch, working down to long on"
523,"Maxwell to Saad Ali, 2 leg byes Saad comes down the track and is almost beaten behind his legs, but gets some pad on it to find a leg bye"
524,"Maxwell to Saad Ali, 1 run Saad spots some width, slicing it square for a single to keep the strike, 11 off the over"
525,"Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 1 run swatted uppishly into the leg side, but falling safely in front of the fielder"

529,"Coulter-Nile to Imad Wasim, no run Imad backs away and rifles a shot into the off side, but he can't beat Lyon at mid off"
530,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, 1 run short, outside off, and it's slapped hard out to the sweeper for Rizwan to raise his second hundred of the series. And this is only the second time that two Pakistan batsmen have scored ODI hundreds in the same chase"
531,"Kane Richardson to Imad Wasim, no run big swish outside off, but he hits only fresh air!"
532,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, no run another play and a miss! Richardson is opting for a short-pitched approach, and Rizwan just cut underneath it"
533,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, FOUR runs this will help a little, Rizwan sprinting down the track and flat-batting another short one straight back over Richardson's head"
534,"Kane Richardson to Rizwan, no run on a length, straight, and Rizwan is furious with himself as he can only push it back to the bowler. He was looking for a single to keep the strike"
535,"Stoinis to Yasir Shah, 1 run just short of a good length, Yasir slugging it straight down the ground. Long on cleans up, and they only take a single"
536,"Stoinis to Rizwan, 1 wide an attempted slower bouncer goes awry, looping way down the leg side"
537,"Stoinis to Yasir Shah, 1 run short, rising over off stump, and Yasir can only pull to long on"

539,"Stoinis to Yasir Shah, 1 run another slow bouncer, it's pulled out to deep square leg, and that's the game"
540,"And that's all from your commentary team tonight, with Alex Malcolm and Liam Brickhill having kept you informed over the course of the game. Australia's one-day renaissance continues apace, and they will take some serious confidence into the fifth and final game on Sunday. Do join us again for that game. Until then, goodbye!"
541,"11.00pm A bizarre chase from Pakistan. Perhaps it was the inexperience in their ranks? It's the fourth time in history that a side has lost an ODI chase with two centurions. Pakistan were cruising when Abid Ali and Mohammad Rizwan were in the midst of their 144-run stand, but when Abid fell after reaching his ton, Australia had their opening. The required rate climbed, Australia found their way back into the game, and n"
