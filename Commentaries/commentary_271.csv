0,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run tucked off the pads out to deep square-leg"
1,"Broad to Marsh, no run full outside off, driven on the up to mid-off"
2,"Broad to Marsh, 2 runs a nice piece of timing through the leg side as he flicks a straight delivery in front of square...nearly reaches the short boundary"
3,"Broad to Marsh, 1 run touch fuller on middle and off, Marsh closes the face and finds a gap at square leg"
4,"Broad to Clarke, no run full outside off, a slightly flat-footed drive by Clarke but safe enough"
5,"Broad to Clarke, no run short ball outside off stump, Clarke doesn't have to do much more than just nod his head out of the way"
6,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run defended to backward point"
7,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run fuller delivery, driven towards mid-off and it's the lack of timing that gives him time for a comfortable single"
8,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run defended with soft hands square into the off side but Morgan is quickly in from point"
9,"Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs neatly worked off the stumps and bisects long leg and deep square"
10,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run too straight and tucked off his hip down to long leg"
11,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run back of a length, taken from off stump into midwicket...good rotation of the strike, but only three boundaries so far"
12,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run round the wicket, driven out to deep cover"
13,"Tredwell to Clarke, 1 run stays round the wicket, Clarke uses his feet then tucks him off the stumps through square leg"
14,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run down the pitch and pushes up to long-on"
15,"Tredwell to Clarke, no run pushed into the on side and Tredwell gets across"
16,"Tredwell to Clarke, no run more footwork down the pitch but picks out square leg this time"
17,"Tredwell to Clarke, no run touch shorter, Clarke rocks back and drives to cover"
18,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run full on middle and off, defended and Bresnan skips across from his followthrough to field"
19,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run tries to work a straight delivery into midwicket but doesn't get it much further than the cut strip"
20,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run more power in this shot, a bottom-handed whip to a full delivery but it goes straight to midwicket"
21,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run outside off, runs it down to third man"
22,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run adjusts well to the right hander, on off stump, defended down into the pitch and it bounces back towards the keeper"
23,"Bresnan to Clarke, OUT all over for Clarke! The pressure brings another breakthrough. Clarke tried to heave a length ball through the leg side, it was a pretty ugly shot and takes a bottom edge into off stump which ends up out of the ground"
24,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run full from round the wicket, driven down the ground"
25,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run uses his feet and gets off the mark to long-on"
26,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run full at off stump, opens the face and finds point"
27,"Tredwell to Marsh, FOUR runs that's an excellent shot, whips it from off stump wide of mid-on for a rare boundary"
28,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run mid-on has gone deep so this time it's an easy single down the ground"
29,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run flicked off the stumps to square leg"
30,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run full and straying a touch on the pads as he whips it through to deep square leg"
31,"Bresnan to Bailey, no run nudges forward as he meets this fullish ball on off stump with a push into the covers."
32,"Bresnan to Bailey, no run safely behind that length ball, but he was looking to clip it through the midwicket region for a single, but none is available"
33,"Bresnan to Bailey, no run nicely behind this again as Bresnan plugs away just outside off"
34,"Bresnan to Bailey, no run good length ball, just outside off as Bailey prods forward and defends"
35,"Bresnan to Bailey, 1 leg bye this time the fuller ball slides down leg and I think it went off the pads as he looked to glance it down."
36,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run closed the face too early there, but the leading edge doesn't carry to the bowler"
37,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run again, looking to nudge it through midwicket and he ends up edging it towards the vacant silly point region"
38,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run more circumspect this time as he defends the fullish offspinner off the front foot"
39,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run moves well across his off stump and ramps it behind to fine leg for a single. Almost premeditated that to fight the line Tredwell is bowling"
40,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run chips down the track and finds long-off for complete an easy single"
41,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run seen him advance again as he shortened the length. Bailey has to settle for no runs as he finds midwicket with a clip"
42,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run really tight bowling from Bresnan, keeps it just short of a good length on and around off stump as Marsh blocks to the covers"
43,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run goes back and plays with soft hands as he dabs it into the off side and before cover can come swooping in on the ball, the batsman run through for the single"
44,"Bresnan to Bailey, no run prods forward to meet the good length ball with a defensive bat."
45,"Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run a thickish outside edge carries the length ball on off stump to deep third man. Bailey did open the face there as he played from the crease"
46,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run and there's a bit of variation. 118 kph-slower ball as Marsh tucks off of the front foot into midwicket and collects a single"
47,"Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run followed by the short ball, not rising enough to trouble Bailey though as he pulls it down and has timed it well enough. There is protection at deep midwicket though."
48,"Tredwell to Bailey, 2 runs oh, Buttler saw and and was rushing down leg to try and block the lap-sweep from Bailey. But he gets good enough bat to get the ball above the keeper"
49,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run flighted on off stump as he reaches the pitch and drives into the covers"
50,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run has a little nip down the track and having reached to the pitch, turns it just wide of mid-on. A little fumble allows the batsmen to sneak a single"
51,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run Bailey advances now but with the length being shortened again, he can only nudge it to the leg side"
52,"Tredwell to Bailey, 2 runs again Buttler anticipates the sweep from Bailey and tries to keep it to none, but the ball is lobbed over the keeper's outstretched arms"
53,"Tredwell to Bailey, no run rocks back and makes room outside leg to cut the ball through point"
54,"Stokes to Marsh, no run just back of a length outside off as Marsh gets in line and blocks"
55,"Stokes to Marsh, no run fuller on off stump as he draws Marsh forward and limits him to a defensive push down the pitch"
56,"Stokes to Marsh, no run length ball on off as this time Marsh chooses to play off the back foot. Opens the face and guides it to point"
57,"Stokes to Marsh, OUT and he's done it! Marsh has clipped it straight to short midwicket! He's been setting a foundation, but that should might not have been part of the plan. Innocuous length ball on the pads and it was there to be whipped away through the leg side. Perhaps it might have come a little slower o"
58,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run solidly behind the first one, which was just short of a good length on middle and off"
59,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run and he's off and running, exploiting a length ball on the pads and clipping it away to deep square leg."
60,"Jordan to Maxwell, no run this one had very little though. 110 kph slower ball as he gets right forward and blocks"
61,"Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs full and sliding down leg as Maxwell leans forward and glances it down to long leg rather nicely."
62,"Jordan to Maxwell, no run short cover does well there, cutting across to his right and diving to keep that elegant drive, hit on the up from Maxwell. Jordan's keeping it nice and full"
63,"Jordan to Maxwell, no run darts in off the pitch and Jordan likes it. But I suspect it might have missed leg. Hit on the knee-roll too as Maxwell is caught on the crease. Was hurrying to flick it away but he wasn't quick enough to combat the movement"
64,"Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run fullish on off and it moves into him again, but this time Maxwell manages to squirt it away through square leg"
65,"Jordan to Bailey, 1 run length ball, hitting the bat rather heavily as Bailey pulls off the bottom hand and places the ball into the midwicket region"
66,"Stokes to Bailey, 1 run loses his radar this time as he offers up a full toss outside off. Bailey fails to capitalise as he goes forward and smacks it straight to point"
67,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run very full outside off again, just inside the wide line as Maxwell looks to chop it to third man, but doesn't connect"
68,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run full on the stumps as he drives quite nicely. Stokes gets a finger on it and the ball deflects onto the stumps as there is a bit of an appeal, but Bailey had plonked his bat inside"
69,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run full and angling in on the pads as he clips it away through square leg"
70,"Stokes to Bailey, no run full and just outside off as he drives down the ground"
71,"Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs aha, we have a boundary. The first since seven overs as Bailey clips a full delivery angled in at him straight of deep midwicket"
72,"Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye shortish and on the hips as he works it away towards fine leg"
73,"Jordan to Bailey, no run fullish and targeting the stumps but Bailey is equal to the challenge"
74,"Jordan to Bailey, 1 run no movement of the feet there as Jordan generates some inward movement off a good length. Thick inside edge helps him get off strike as the ball wanders away through square leg"
75,"Jordan to Maxwell, no run length ball on the stumps as he looks to whip it away, but can't get bat to ball"
76,"Jordan to Maxwell, no run pounds in on a good length as Maxwell comes forward to defend"
77,"Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run opens the face and chops this back of a length ball outside off just to the right of the keeper"
78,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run that gap just in front of square leg is proving quite useful as this short of a good length delivery is tucked away for another single"
79,"Stokes to Bailey, 1 leg bye very tight single but Bailey makes it, courtesy the throw being deflected off his bat as he was grounding it. He'd missed the flick and Maxwell calls him through. Stokes gets to the ball quickly but can't strike the stumps direct"
80,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run fullish on middle and off as he defends off the front foot"
81,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run strays down the pads as he looks to whip it away, but has to settle for a leg bye to long leg"
82,"Stokes to Bailey, 1 run width offered outside off stump, but it was nice and full again as Bailey sinks low and meets it with an open face"
83,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run goes short this time and the line was right on middle too, but Maxwell covers it well as he goes ball and pulls it down to fine leg for a single"
84,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run length outside off as he punches it off the front foot to deep point with little fuss"
85,"Bopara to Bailey, FOUR runs very clever. It had enough width for Bailey to nudge forward and open the face. Got it fine enough to beat deep third man for another boundary."
86,"Bopara to Bailey, 1 run this time he can't get it as fine and backward point keeps it to a single"
87,"Bopara to Maxwell, no run went a touch wide of the crease that time as he keeps it full and on off stump. Maxwell drives back to the bowler"
88,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run pushed to long-on as he meets the length ball with a good straight bat"
89,"Bopara to Bailey, no run ducks in a touch off the pitch, which makes Bailey pull out a short-armed jab to midwicket"
90,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run looks to dab the back of a length ball behind point, but can't place it well enough"
91,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run draws him forward and Maxwell meets the full length ball outside off with a straight bat. Can't get it far enough away from the bowler though"
92,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run tries a late cut, but there wasn't enough width there. Good delivery from Stokes, just short of a good length and around fifth stump"
93,"Stokes to Maxwell, 2 runs full and just wide enough outside off for him to lean forward and play a solid cover drive"
94,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 leg bye stifled appeal as this is full and pushed into the pads of Maxwell. Was always going down leg"
95,"Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish on off stump as he comes forward to block"
96,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run worked away towards the square leg region as he rides the angle of this full length ball coming in at him"
97,"Bopara to Bailey, no run length ball on the stumps, Bailey is content to keep it out."
98,"Bopara to Bailey, no run shortish, but it didn't rise high enough which foiled that pull stroke. The ball lobs off the thigh and down to the keeper"
99,"Bopara to Bailey, no run turns the full length ball on the pads to square leg"
100,"Bopara to Bailey, no run full and just outside off as he drives, but can't time it well enough"
101,"Bopara to Bailey, 1 run nudged away to deep midwicket off the front foot as this was full and sneaking down leg"
102,"Stokes to Bailey, no run length on off stump as he keeps to his crease and defends"

104,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run head right over this one kept on a good length on off stump as he defends off the front foot"
105,"Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run third man has more work as Maxwell guides the back of a length ball away from off stump"
106,"Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs punished and how! That brings up the hundred for Australia as Bailey pounces onto the width on offer. Rocks back and cuts it behind point with considerable authority"
107,"Stokes to Bailey, 2 runs compensates as he tightens his line and in the process strays into the pads as he tucks it to long leg for a couple"
108,"Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs the run-rate's definitely on an upswing now. strays on the pads with a full length ball and Maxwell flicks it to the leg of short fine leg and has timed it quite well"
109,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run on the stumps again as this is punched to long-on for a single"
110,"Bopara to Bailey, 1 run fullish on middle as he pushes down to long-on off the front foot"
111,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run fullish and just outside off as Maxwell presses forward and steers it just behind point for a single."
112,"Bopara to Bailey, 1 run touch fuller and he ensures the line is well outside off as Bailey guides it away to deep point"
113,"Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run full and seeking off stump but Maxwell moves confidently onto his front foot and drives to deep cover"
114,"Stokes to Maxwell, no run searches for the blockhole and he finds it. Maxwell can do little more than stop the ball from crashing into the stumps"
115,"Stokes to Maxwell, OUT Stokes does it again! Maxwell nicks off! He was doing reasonably well, especially with those drives through cover and dabs to third man, but this time he can't get good enough bat. It was fullish and he wanted to run it to third man again, but only manages a healthy edge through to the k"
116,"Stokes to Wade, no run full and just outside off as he drives towards mid-off"
117,"Stokes to Wade, 1 run off the mark with a flick down to deep midwicket as this was on a length and on leg stump"
118,"Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish and on the stumps as he is able to keep it out with a push to mid-on"

120,"Tredwell to Wade, 1 run bit shortish and outside off as he goes back and punches through to deep cover"
121,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run charges him and reaches to the pitch, but still plays with the turn. Clipped to deep midwicket and he runs with the shot for a single"
122,"Tredwell to Wade, no run pushed through on middle and leg as Wade can only defend off the back foot"
123,"Tredwell to Wade, no run another venture down the track but the new batsman can't find his timing or placement. Tredwell is safely behind it"
124,"Tredwell to Wade, 1 run tossed up and angled into the pads as he turns it behind square leg for a single"
125,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run silly misfield means the over ends with a single to long-on. He reached forward and dabbed it straight of midwicket, and the fielder dived over the ball"
126,"Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish and on off stump as he pushes to mid-off. Nice stride forward from Bailey"
127,"Stokes to Bailey, 1 run easily clipped off the pads as this was on a length and targeting leg stump. Deep square leg keeps it to one"
128,"Stokes to Wade, no run strides forward and drives through the line of the full length ball outside off, but cannot get it past mid-off"
129,"Stokes to Wade, 1 run fullish on middle, and he plonks the front foot towards the off side and nudges it towards the midwicket region and picks up a single"
130,"Stokes to Bailey, 2 runs Bailey hustles and he gets through for a couple after flicking this length ball off the pads to fine leg"
131,"Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs dangerous, but effective. Full toss outside off and Bailey might have ended up looking rather silly had mid-on managed to get his hands to that. But the chip had enough power on it to beat his dive and run away for four"
132,"Tredwell to Wade, 1 run moves deep in his crease and punches the length ball into the covers"
133,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run chips down the track and places the tossed up ball on leg stump square of fine leg to pick up a single."

142,"Bresnan to Wade, 1 run goes for the hook, but has not got hold of it at all. Good short ball from Bresnan, possibly catching Wade off guard. But it lands safely despite deep square leg running in"

162,"Bresnan to Wade, no run on the back foot now, Wade crunches it back towards Bresnan"

167,"Bresnan to Wade, FOUR runs this time Wade gets his pull away, and he's placed it well enough that it bounces over the boundary for four. There was a man at deep midwicket but this went squarer and Wade will be relieved to have his first boundary on the board"

169,"Broad to Bailey, 1 wide down leg side now and the Australians pick up a bonus run"

177,"Jordan to Wade, no run Wade nudges out towards cover point and can't find a run"
178,"Jordan to Wade, 1 leg bye lbw shout here from Jordan and this didn't look too bad, maybe just pitching a touch outside leg? The umpire wasn't really interested. He was struck in line but possibly height an issue too. Pretty close shout, but England don't have a review left"
179,"Jordan to Bailey, no run down leg and clips the pad on the way through"
180,"Jordan to Bailey, no run Bailey gets a little width but his drive can't beat cover"
181,"Stokes to Wade, FOUR runs Stokes gives Wade something short and wide to start with and Wade pounces on it - he has thrown everything at a cut and to the short square boundaries at this ground that was always going to be four"

183,"Stokes to Bailey, 1 run Bailey waits and plays this very late, steers a single down to third man"
184,"Stokes to Wade, 1 run Wade walks down the pitch and works one out to deep midwicket along the ground"
185,"Stokes to Bailey, OUT Bailey tries to lift the scoring rate here and he's perished doing it, he's planted the front foot and tried to crunch Stokes straight down the ground but drags it towards mid-on instead, and Stuart Broad takes a good catch."

192,"Jordan to Faulkner, 1 run Faulkner leans out to defend and gets off the mark with a thick inside edge away behind square"

194,"Broad to Faulkner, 1 run pushed out through point for another single"
195,"Broad to Wade, no run Wade defensively pushes away to off"
196,"Broad to Wade, no run tries to cut hard now but this ball was perhaps just a touch too straight to cut, it beats the bat through to Buttler"
197,"Broad to Wade, OUT oh, Wade has been bowled behind his legs! Wade has been walking across his stumps quite often in this innings, this time he doesn't get bat on Ball and Broad pitches it just outside leg and it goes on with the angle to take the leg stump"

208,"Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run fuller and wide of off, Faulkner can only nudge a single"
209,"Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs Coulter-Nile has decided he too will go after Bresnan, and he's planted the foot and launched a drive over wide mid-off, well struck and this bounces away to the boundary"

214,"Jordan to Faulkner, 1 run good yorker length ball that Faulkner clips away through midwicket and they want two but the fielding is sharp enough to prevent it"
215,"Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run again a good yorker from Jordan, all Coulter-Nile can do is clip it away through square leg"
216,"Jordan to Faulkner, 2 runs this time the yorker is just not quite the right length, a half-volley that Faulkner lifts over wide midwicket but the man running around on the boundary cuts it off"

218,"Broad to Coulter-Nile, no run good line outside off and it's driven hard to cover"
219,"Broad to Coulter-Nile, 1 run Coulter-Nile goes aerial now, he's flicked this uppishly off his pads and Stokes is at deep midwicket, he runs in and this ball only just falls short of the diving Stokes. Nearly a catch - very nearly a catch."

228,"Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye half a shout for lbw from Stokes as Coulter-Nile tries to work this through leg - there were two noises but it was front pad onto back pad - maybe sliding down leg but not a bad shout"
229,"Stokes to Faulkner, no run defended away to the off side"
230,"Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run half a chance here for Bresnan, a dropped chance but an incredibly tough one as Coulter-Nile drives it hard back towards the bowler's left - he thrusts the hand out and it doesn't stick"
231,"Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run wide of off now and crunched away towards point"
232,"Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run uppishly driven through cover point now and Bell in the deep collects"

234,"Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run run-out chance here as Bresnan goes full and Faulkner's little inside edge is collected by Buttler, whose underarm throw hits the stumps. Coulter-Nile has slid the bat in nicely though and made good ground. The umpire asks for a replay but Coulter-Nile is shown to be safe"
235,"Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run driven back past the bowler for a single"
236,"Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run low full toss again and it's driven back over the head of the bowler"
237,"Jordan to Faulkner, no run Jordan mixes it up now with the bouncer that Faulkner perhaps wasn't expecting - the attempted hook misses"
238,"Jordan to Faulkner, OUT Jordan gets this one too full but it's brought him a wicket! Faulkner's eyes light up with a full toss at knee height, he's got it high out towards midwicket but hasn't got enough on it to clear the fielder, who takes a comfortable catch."
239,"Jordan to Coulter-Nile, OUT and Jordan finds himself on a hat-trick after getting this one fast and straight enough to have Coulter-Nile lbw trying to walk across and force it through leg. That looked pretty plumb at first glance."
240,"Jordan to Doherty, 1 run no hat-trick for Jordan as Doherty gets one just outside off and crunches it through point for a single"
241,"Jordan to McKay, 1 run McKay winds up for a slog but this is collected at mid-on and they just pick up a single"
242,"Well, that really was some excellent bowling from England, especially in those last few overs when they just didn't give the batsmen anything much to hit. The early wickets set the tone and Australia could never quite get themselves back into rhythm. George Bailey made a half-century but fell trying to lift the rate."
243,"Welcome back. The first half of this match went well for England, barring some dodgy fielding, a few hours of solid batting should see them win but it's a tricky, slow surface. Australia were subdued throughout against some very good bowling. Xavier Doherty and Shane Watson will have key roles to play with the ball."

264,"McKay to Bell, no run fuller and closer to off stump, defended to cover"
265,"McKay to Bell, no run close! Nearly a return catch. A full delivery, Bell shaping to play through midwicket and the toe-end rushes back towards McKay, low to his right. Finger-tip job."
266,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, 1 run short outside off, stays on the back foot and cuts behind point"
267,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run another leading edge, aiming to play a length delivery through the leg side and the leading edge loops into the covers this time"
268,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run left alone outside off, this one carries nicely to Wade"
269,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs that's elegant from Bell, completely in control this as McKay drifts too straight and gets flicked over midwicket"

281,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run punched to midwicket"
282,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs ah, that's lovely from Bell...a beautiful back-foot square drive which pierces the gap between point and cover. Technically perfect"
283,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, OUT from beauty to the beast! The danger of driving on this pitch, it wasn't a half volley and Bell tried to go on the up and only succeeded in spooning a catch to mid-off. Careless really from Bell, having already been given warning signs with a couple of leading edges."

299,"McKay to Root, no run full on off stump, behind the line and defended"

312,"McKay to Cook, FOUR runs lovely stroke, McKay getting too straight and Cook times it as well as anything today through square leg...bottom hand come into play"
313,"McKay to Cook, no run comes forward into a punchy drive, but McKay takes the heat off it in his followthrough"
314,"Faulkner to Root, FOUR runs latches onto a short ball, and commits to going up and over...clears midwicket. His movement around the crease helped create that scoring chance"

358,"Doherty to Cook, no run nicely flighted on off stump as Cook reaches forward and defends"
359,"Doherty to Cook, FOUR runs muscled away, not often you describe a stroke from Cook that way, but he got down on one knee and swept this flat ball on middle with a bit of disdain"
360,"Doherty to Cook, 1 run goes back and whips the ball in front of midwicket for a single"
361,"Doherty to Root, no run ventures down the track, but having not reached the pitch of this length ball on middle, he resorts to defence"

366,"Maxwell to Root, 2 runs flatter delivery on off stump as he rocks back and cuts well in front of point"
367,"Maxwell to Root, no run this time it comes a little slower off the pitch to ruin Root's timing. Only gets a thick edge and Root is not pleased. That was a shortish delivery too"

373,"Doherty to Root, no run keeps it on and around off stump as he pushes into the covers"

391,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, OUT he's spooned it to short cover! Coulter-Nile is elated as he sends the England captain packing.

398,"Doherty to Root, 1 run length on off stump as he goes back and punches into the covers. Bailey gets a good bounce and sends in the throw.

400,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run fullish on off stump as he comes forward and drives down the pitch"

424,"Watson to Root, 1 run better, works this wide of mid-on after coming down the pitch to meet the fullish ball on middle"
425,"Watson to Morgan, SIX runs slapped straight over the top, that's the first six of the game! Watson overpitches this time and the left-hander was waiting for it. Strides forward and unleashes a full swing of the bat"

456,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run rock-solid forward defensive from Morgan as this was full and on off stump"
457,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run nudges the length ball outside off between point and cover and they pick up a good single"
458,"Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs another boundary now as Faulkner goes a touch too short and wide and Morgan cuts this away behind point"
459,"Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run driven down towards mid-off"
460,"Faulkner to Root, 1 bye nearly got through and bowled Root here, this one stays a bit low and it was also too close to off to cut, which was what Root tried to do. Nearly clips his off stump but in the end they get a bye after a ricochet off the keeper"
461,"Faulkner to Morgan, OUT there's the wicket Australia needed! And it's Morgan, he's driven this uppishly - but not uppishly enough - to mid-off. He looked like he was trying to clear the field but it's just sailed into the hands of Watson for an easy catch"
462,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run solid in defence"
463,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run Bopara defends watchfully again"

470,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run Faulkner is around the wicket and angles this in towards the off stump, which it doesn't miss by much as Bopara shoulders arms"
471,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run Bopara tries another guide to third man but gets it too square"
472,"Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run clipped away through the leg side for a single"
473,"Faulkner to Root, no run Faulkner is over the wicket to Root, who defends back to the bowler"
474,"Faulkner to Root, OUT oh boy, now Root is gone! Does this match have a twist in the ending? Root has walked across his stumps and tried to paddle down to fine leg but he didn't get much on it and Doherty at short fine leg in the circle had no trouble taking that"

483,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run driven away to cover and can't find the gap"

485,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run pushed away to the leg side"
486,"Faulkner to Bopara, no run again driven to Steve Smith at short cover on the bounce"
487,"Faulkner to Bopara, 2 runs Bopara takes a risk now and it's a biggun as he lifts Faulkner high, high out towards long-on, Watson running back from in the circle looks like he's going to make it, he has to sprint a long way back from mid-on, then at the last minute it falls just in front of him and he can only"
488,"Doherty to Buttler, no run pushed away to the off side"
489,"Doherty to Buttler, 1 run driven down towards long-off"
490,"Doherty to Bopara, 2 runs another push towards long-off and well run to turn this into two as Watson is a bit slow getting to the ball"

499,"Watson to Buttler, no run angling it in towards off stump and Buttler drives it back to the bowler"
500,"Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run sharp single here! Risky one as Bopara tucks it off his hip to midwicket and Bailey is quickly on to the ball, his throw from roughly side on just misses and lucky for Buttler it does, as he was short"
501,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run driven back past the bowler"
502,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT Buttler is gone now! England are digging themselves into a hole here! A shortish ball from Coulter-Nile gets Buttler's eyes lighting up and he goes for the pull, it comes out of the middle of the bat but not with enough elevation and McKay at deep midwicket takes the catch"

504,"Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan gets off the mark with a clip off his pads up in the air through midwicket"

508,"Watson to Bopara, no run nudged away off the pads to the leg side and can't find a gap"
509,"Watson to Bopara, 1 run Bopara walks across his stumps and tickles this to short fine leg, he takes off for a quick single and Doherty inside the circle throws at the stumps at the striker's end, misses, but Bresnan was probably just home"
510,"Watson to Bresnan, 1 run off a leading edge now as Bresnan tries to work to leg and instead picks up a single in the air to deep point"
511,"Watson to Bopara, 1 wide bonus run for England now as Watson sends this one down leg for a wide"
512,"Watson to Bopara, FOUR runs there's a much-needed boundary for England as Bopara flashes hard outside off and beats point, and the sweeper from deep cover dives in desperation but can only parry this over the boundary"
513,"Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, no run goes for a drive down towards mid-on and can't find the gap"
514,"Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 2 runs shortish ball and Bresnan swivels this pull around behind square, and they pick up a couple to Doherty, who doesn't have one of the stronger arms in this Australian team"
515,"Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, SIX runs Bresnan gives England some breathing space! He's lifted this off middle and leg and got enough bat on that to clear the boundary at wide midwicket, much-needed six that for England!"

522,"Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run Bopara works this off his hips to midwicket, Clarke's throw hits at the non-striker's end but the batsman is well home. The umpire asks for a replay, but the replay shows he was so far in he was nearly past the stumps"
523,"Faulkner to Bresnan, OUT this time it's gone though! A run-out keeps Australia in the contest as Bresnan gets an inside edge onto his pad and out towards cover, they take off for a run but Bresnan is slow, Maxwell's throw is a direct hit at the non-striker's end and this time Bresnan is well short!"
524,"Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run Bopara opens the face to run a single down to third man and he'll keep the strike"
525,"McKay to Bopara, 1 run Bopara again glides a single down to third man - a run a ball is enough for England, as long as they don't accumulate many dots along the way"
526,"McKay to Broad, 1 run Broad almost plays on here! He tries to force a ball through off but it's very straight, this one skews away past leg stump for a single to short fine leg"
527,"McKay to Bopara, 1 run another single steered to third man"
528,"McKay to Broad, FOUR runs Broad finds the boundary! Big shot this, he's driven it through cover and found the gap - really good placement and that gives England a little breathing space once again"

536,"McKay to Jordan, 1 run driven away to point and they get through for a quick single to get Bopara back on strike"
537,"McKay to Bopara, 1 run just outside off from McKay and Bopara does what he's been doing all through his innings, steers it off the face down to third man - and in fact it's deflected off Wade's pad, which might have saved any more runs"
538,"McKay to Jordan, 1 run clipped uppishly through short midwicket, just wide of the man"
539,"McKay to Bopara, OUT beaten outside off! Bopara has again just tried to tickle it away and doesn't get bat on ball. In fact there's a stumping appeal. Has Bopara lifted his foot? Oh this is close. Wade hasn't whipped the bails off, the ball has just ricocheted off him down onto the top of the bails. The third"

541,"McKay to Jordan, no run all Jordan can do is get bat on ball here and works it to short midwicket"

545,"Clarke says he has two days off now before the Test squad flies to South Africa on Wednesday. New challenges ahead for those guys. For now, Michael Clarke is being presented with the series trophy. So the Tests and ODIs combined didn't quite end in the 10-0 that looked possible, but 9-1 is still a very comprehensive"
546,"Shane Watson has done the job and with that wicket Australia have moved back up to No.1 on the ICC rankings with a 4-1 series win. England will wonder how they managed to lose that match. When the batting powerplay began with 15 overs left, England needed 70 runs only with seven wickets in hand. But those wickets tum"
547,Australia won by 5 runs
548,"Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS"
