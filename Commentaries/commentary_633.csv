216,"Gillespie to Hussey, (no ball) The off stump goes for a walk but hold on .. its a no ball. Sorrow for the bowler, joy for Hussey. Hussey backed away and is beaten on the drive by a yorker on the off stump."
217,"Gillespie to Hussey, 1 leg bye length-delivery, angling in on the middle and leg, tries to lap it away, and it rolls of the pad"
218,"Gillespie to Watson, SIX runs Whack. Watson takes one step back with his front leg and then thrusts forward, like a baseball hitter, and swing a fullish delivery outside off over cover. Flat and fast. Screaming six."
219,"Gillespie to Watson, 2 runs He goes again, gets a bit too under the delivery and it lands in no man's land beyond cover"
220,"Gillespie to Watson, FOUR runs Cute. Shuffles across and paddle scoops, laps it over short fine leg. Ala Ashraful. Of course had he missed, I would have written too cute for his own comfort."
221,"Gillespie to Watson, FOUR runs Whoosh! Disappears to the midwicket boundary. It was a slower one, ends up as a low full-toss, on the off stump and clubbed over midwicket."
222,"Gillespie to Watson, SIX runs Leading edge to six over long on. Hmm... Gillespie went round the stumps, bowled one fullish, on leg and middle, Watson tried to loft it over wide midwicket, got a leading edge and it flew over the ropes."
223,"Patel to Hayden, no run slow in the air, lands on the middle and off, turns towards off, dabbed away to the off side."
224,"Patel to Hayden, 2 runs fuller, on the off stump line, swept to long leg where McMillan fumbles and gives away an extra run"
225,"Patel to Hayden, 1 run flighted, really slow in the air, Hayden is on the sweep, is made to wait and he takes out the top-hand off the handle, sweeps it to McMillan. No mistake from him this time and the crowd cheer. He smiles."
226,"Patel to Ponting, 1 run on the middle stump line, Ponting paddles it away behind square-leg"
227,"Patel to Hayden, 1 run Another sweep, again it is McMillan. Again the crowd give him the full treatment."
228,"Patel to Ponting, OUT Suddenly, against the run of play, Ponting falls. Tossed-up, full in length, on the off stump line, Ponting skips down the track and whips it, but it goes in the air and Ross Taylor, at midwicket, jumps up to grab it. Ponting was trying to get it past"
229,"Gillespie to Hayden, no run fullish, almost yorker-length, on the off stump line, jabbed back to the bowler"

236,"McMillan to Watson, 2 runs This is interesting. Yet another slower one, again the batsmen is unable to do much with it, shovelled past midwicket"
237,"McMillan to Watson, FOUR runs Not any more. Sends this slower one to long on boundary. Watson waited this time and hit it down the ground. Marshall at long on rushed across to his left and threw in a full length dive but can't reach it. One bounce over the ropes"
238,"McMillan to Watson, 1 run on the off stump line, late cut to third man"
239,"McMillan to Hussey, 1 run full and outside off stump, slicked past cover"
240,"McMillan to Watson, 1 run another slow off break, lands outside off stump and turns in. Watson had shuffled across the stumps to play his lap/paddle shot but there is not much pace to work with and he ends up swatting it to short fine leg region"
241,"Franklin to Watson, 2 runs moves outside leg stump and slices a fullish delivery towards deep point. Comes back for the second and hello! its his fifty. Breezy knock."
242,"Franklin to Watson, 1 run on the middle and leg, pushed to midwicket for a single. Franklin is bowling from round the stumps"
243,"Franklin to Hussey, OUT Fools Hussey with a slower one. From over the wicket, full and outside off, Hussey went down his knee and tried to swing it across the line, got a top edge to square-leg."
244,"Franklin to Watson, SIX runs Up .. up and over long on. Full, from round the stumps, right in the slot and Watson knives through the line."
245,"Franklin to Watson, 2 runs slower ball, on the leg stump line, Watson retains the strike with a push past square-leg."
246,"Franklin to Watson, SIX runs The white ball is flying everywhere. This one, the last ball of the innings, has been sucked over cover. He backed to the leg side and smoked a full-pitched one up and over cover."
247,In the record chase in Hamilton New Zealand hunted down 346. Today they have to beat that. 349 to win. Can they? The wicket has got a bit slower. Join us in a while to find out.
248,Right... all set. The chase is about to get underway
249,"Bracken to Fulton, no run starts off in the channel outside off stump, Fulton doesn't like the programming and lets it go past him"
250,"Bracken to Fulton, no run And again. Much closer to the off stump this time. The next one should be interesting. I think he will take it away again."

258,"Tait to Fulton, 1 wide banged in short, lost control at the release, right arm fell over at an awkward angle and the ball slips down leg side. It's Tait. By this time you would have got used to all this."
259,"Tait to Fulton, no run again banged in short, it whizzes just past the leg stump, Very close to the body and Asad Rauf thinks its too close to call a wide."
260,"Tait to Fulton, no run fuller, on a length, outside the off stump, goes on straight, left alone"

268,"Tait to Fulton, 1 run banged in short, at the body, on middle and leg, Fulton is caught in a tangle but he adjusts to swipe it away, pulls it away with a bit of top edge to fine leg"
269,"Tait to Fleming, FOUR runs edged past second slip. Full in length, slanting away from Fleming who shuffled across, had a flash and it flew past Ponting. It would have gone straight to third slip. Tait is not amused. Bouncer coming up, surely."
270,"Tait to Fleming, OUT gets him with a bouncer. Fleming is not happy. Banged in short, on the middle and off, Fleming tries to pull off the front foot, the ball bounces more than he anticipated, and thudded into his left arm before bobbing away to Ponting at second slip. They"
271,"Tait to Taylor, no run fuller, on the middle and leg stump line, Taylor tries to flick it, loses balance in the process, falls over a touch and inside-edges it on to the pad. Can we play straight when we are new to the crease please?!"

280,"McGrath to Taylor, OUT McGrath gets a wicket off his first ball. Wicket no 66 for him in World cups. Banged in short, Taylor is on the front foot, goes for a pull from there and hits straight to midwicket. McGrath is obviously happy. Looks at the batsman, claps before runni"
