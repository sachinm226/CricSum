26,"McGrath to Bell, no run on the money, rises, and that's defended off the back foot"
27,"McGrath to Bell, no run outside off once more, arms are shouldered"
28,"McGrath to Bell, no run more good length and Bell plays that one late, waiting for it to climb before offering soft hands and a bat angled down"

68,"Warne to Flintoff, no run defended forward"
69,"Warne to Flintoff, no run Flintoff prods forward and edge falls low to gully - 'Catch' is the knee-jerk cry"

78,"Warne to PD Collingwood, no run on leg, that goes straight on and that's well defended"
79,"Warne to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs pitches on leg again and that's swept away to the boundary where it eludes a diving McGrath who gets cheered anyway, just because he can be"
80,"Warne to PD Collingwood, 1 run on leg, and that's punched on the front foot to square"
81,"Warne to Flintoff, no run on middle, that bends away and it's driven tamely to cover"
82,"Warne to Flintoff, 1 run swept powerfully away behind square but McGrath seizes that one on the boundary"
83,"Warne to PD Collingwood, no run moves across the right hander after pitching straight and it's left at the last minute"

91,"Clark to Flintoff, no run outside off, flies down the corridor and Flintoff doesn't go sniffing"
92,"Clark to Flintoff, no run slower ball, curving away once more from the right hander who chooses to leave it well alone"
93,"Clark to Flintoff, no run even slower ball and Flintoff drives uppishly, but the ball stays low and pitches way before Symonds"
94,"Clark to Flintoff, SIX runs hello! Top shot there from Flintoff, came from nowhere really"
95,"Clark to Flintoff, no run shorter ball in response, but that's well left outside the off stick"

107,"Clark to PD Collingwood, no run pushed up there, just outside off, and that's defended forward"

110,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run came back off the seam but again the bounce carried it over the top"
111,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run left alone outside off"
112,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run pushed right up there, yorker in fact, and that's well defended"
113,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run worked into the leg side"

128,"Warne to Flintoff, 1 run full toss worked to deep midwicket"
129,"Warne to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs another full toss, and he may be one of the greatest bowlers of all time but that was filthy, and Collingwood smacked that square on the leg side"
130,"Warne to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs and again, even fuller, and the end result is the much the same"
131,"Warne to PD Collingwood, no run finally Warne gets one on target and Collingwood goes back and blocks"

145,"Clark to Flintoff, no run into line, patted away"
146,"Clark to Flintoff, no run Flintoff pushes forward, leaves it and waves the bat above his head with a little flourish more becoming of one of the Four Musketeers"
147,"Clark to Flintoff, FOUR runs leg-side line, Flintoff just leans into it and the ball races through straight midwicket ... Clark was almost felled by the jogging Flintoff, whose eyes were on the ball, to add injury to insult"
148,"Clark to Flintoff, no run Clark readjusts and it passes outside the off stump"

180,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more swing, more leaving"

182,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run speaking of oh - OH! - Collingwood should have gone there. For the second day running, Langer drops a catch at third slip. It's low and you don't need the replays to see if it carried - you can tell from his body language. Yesterday when he dropped Strauss he lay on his front"
183,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more swing and Collingwood veers away from it, letting it whistle past his nose"

185,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run more leaving"
186,"McGrath to Flintoff, FOUR runs oh, an edge, and Langer's beaten again at third slip - but it wasn't a chance, as it bounced in front of him. Langer's more porous than a dodgy goalkeeper so far today. Flintoff beaten, though"

189,"McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run Flintoff squeezes that one out to the leg-side, well played"
190,"Lee to Flintoff, no run ooh, a beauty - full and late movement, tempting Flintoff into the stroke. No foot movement and he just swishes at that. This is great bowling from the Australian pace pair first up"
191,"Lee to Flintoff, no run"
192,"Lee to Flintoff, no run left alone again"
193,"Lee to Flintoff, no run right on the money, Flintoff jams the bat down and Lee picks up the rebound and mock-shies at the stumps just to let Flintoff know he's alert"

208,"McGrath to Flintoff, 3 runs opens his shoulders and cover-drives that powerfully but Symonds cuts it off. That's Flintoff's 24th Test this fifty, this one coming up from 89 balls"
209,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run left alone outside off"
210,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run again left, again easily"
211,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run straighter and that one crashes in at Flintoff, high"
212,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run defended into the covers"
213,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT jaffer, unplayable. That bounces up and Collingwood's squared up, feathering that one through to Gilchrist for McGrath's third delivery. The way McGrath's been bowling this morning that wicket was pretty inevitable - and just reward for his endeavours"
214,"Lee to Flintoff, no run short, sharp bouncer earns huge applause from the crowds as Flintoff ducks away from it - just about. Lee likes it too, allowing himself a little grin. He and McGrath are enjoying themselves out there"
215,"Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs short and Flintoff waits for it, angling it straight down into the ground and it races past gully"

227,"Lee to Flintoff, 1 run straighter, good response, and Flintoff squares up to that one with a straight bat and they manage a single"
228,"Lee to Read, no run left alone outside off"
229,"Lee to Read, 2 runs a huge appeal for lbw for one which keeps low but he got an inside edge on it, a real sliver of an edge which just saves him - although, actually, height may have been a factor, there, too"
230,"Lee to Read, OUT no hiding place this time and he's gone! That one was too good, too fast and Read can't control it, flashing an edge through off the back foot. He could have left it, as it happened, given the ball swung away but it was all over with very quickly."
231,"Lee to Mahmood, OUT Lee's on a hat-trick, Mahmood has no idea where that's gone - to Hayden at gully as it happens. Top stuff from Lee again - hostile and England have no answers to either him or McGrath"

237,"McGrath to Harmison, no run Harmison steps over to that one, which is in the corridor, and decides to leave it"

239,"Lee to Flintoff, 1 run pushed up and that's defended on the front foot, with the batsmen choosing a single again. Lee smiling as he walks back to his mark"
240,"Lee to Harmison, 2 runs Harmison tucks that one away off his toes and manages to get two - England would have loved the three, there, but it wasn't to be"
241,"Lee to Harmison, no run big call for LBW, turned down. Harmison hadn't got too far forward there but Bowden said no."
242,"Lee to Harmison, no run beautifully bowled once more, just outside the off stump and it's too good for Harmison who can't get anything, not even an edge, on it"
243,"Lee to Harmison, no run past the outside edge once more"
244,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off"
245,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run quietly nudged to square, there was a run on, an easy one, but he chose to keep the strike. Boos from the crowd, but Flintoff's being sensible there"

256,"McGrath to Harmison, no run defended forward"
257,"McGrath to Harmison, no run swings that one away down the corridor and like some orange-and-purple socks in a New Year sale, it's left well alone"

268,"McGrath to Flintoff, no run straight, circumspect defence, all a bit low key"

311,"Clark to Panesar, no run Dropped! Fuller and Panesar drives, the edge flies to Langer at third slip and for the third time he drops one there. He took off his hat and threw it in the air in disgust - but managed to catch it, at least ... his mind seems anywhere but in the middle and he buries his head in"

334,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run Ponting blocks with bat and a thud of pad as well"
335,"Mahmood to Ponting, 3 runs clipped off his toes to deep square leg, Panesar has a lot of ground to make up trundling round from long leg, and that plus his slightly weak arm allows a third"

535,"Panesar to Symonds, 2 runs in the air... but safe. Symonds attempts another lofted drive, aiming for mid-on, a thick outside edge flies over to backward point and beyond Pietersen. Ponting shaking his head on the balcony"

555,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run Gilchrist watches and waits"
556,"Anderson to Gilchrist, FOUR runs in the slot and wide, Gilchrist frees his arms and drives in the air over the gullies and all the way to the rope. No risk with that, it was way over the close men's heads"

638,"Panesar to Symonds, 1 run driven slowly to mid-on"
639,"Panesar to Gilchrist, no run defended this time"
640,"Panesar to Gilchrist, no run pushed up there and that's quietly defended on the back foot"

646,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run well bowled and Gilchrist goes fishing, his stuck in the crease"
647,"Panesar to Symonds, OUT done him!

648,"Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs Warne gets down on one knee and proposes to sweep that round fine, and in fact the ball does get engaged, with a bottom edge. Off the mark first ball, with a four"

651,"Panesar to Warne, no run a ha, clever from Panesar, just defeating the outside edge as Warne attempts a swish"
652,"Panesar to Warne, no run it's all drama here! This time sharp turn and bounce and I can hardly type fast enough - big deflection off the glove and Read's up to celebrate. Panesar runs forward with a big, smily appeal - Warne looks around, too - but Dar says 'No' and Warne gets a stay of execution"
653,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 2 runs ooh, more excitement - Warne just making his ground for the two as it's winged out in front of point. Mahmood was standing by the side of the stumps, instead of behind them, and could have had him way out there. Warne riding his luck, here"
654,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run defended this time - no dramas"

675,"Harmison to Gilchrist, no run helped out to point"
676,"Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run round the wicket again, that's wide and Gilchrist mishooks that in front of square and it's in the air for a long time but even Panesar's gazelle legs won't carry him there fast enough.

684,"Panesar to Gilchrist, no run pushed right up there and Gilchrist can only defend"
685,"Anderson to Warne, 1 run nudged into the gap through cover"
686,"Anderson to Gilchrist, OUT gone! Fishing at a very wide one and it appears an edge flies up to Read - or was the noise bat into the ground? There's a long time for the crooked finger to spell doom. Gilchrist can't believe it and the crowd can't either - the boos ring out as the dismissal is replayed on th"
687,"Anderson to Lee, no run short and on him and that's fended to gully"

691,"Flintoff to Warne, no run ooh dear, wonky radar there and Warne goes chasing one which flirts down leg"

753,"Flintoff to Warne, 2 runs slightly too short, a sumptuous shot off the back foot through extra cover"
754,"Mahmood to Clark, no run good yorker to start off, Clark digs it out just about"
755,"Mahmood to Clark, 1 run Clark drives straight to mid-on and calls for a daft single, Harmison picks up well but from five yards his hurl at the bowler's-end stumps misses by some way with Clark floundering"
756,"Mahmood to Warne, 1 leg bye thuds into Clarks pads and into the leg side"
757,"Mahmood to Clark, 1 run booming off drive, uppish yet safe"
758,"Mahmood to Warne, no run Warne gets himself in something of a muddle and the net result is he does well to keep the ball out"

760,"Harmison to Clark, 1 run Clark onto the back foot, right over it and dropped into the leg side to get Warne back on strike"

765,"Harmison to Clark, 3 runs driven through the off side and Panesar just catches it inside the rope"
766,"Panesar to Clark, 1 run Clark waits and punches off the back foot to long-off"
767,"Panesar to Warne, no run wide, Warne square drives that to point"

770,"Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs too wide, Warne leans back and hammers that behind square and resumes his sledging of Collingwood before the ball has crossed the ropes!"

778,"Panesar to Warne, no run another miscue??? this one swept round behind square but didn't quite get hold of it"
779,"Panesar to Warne, OUT ah, the fairytale ends. Warne comes way out of his crease and the wristy Read does the rest, whipping off the bails with ease. That's six dismissals again for Read, as at Melbourne. The SCG rises as one for Warne who jogs off waving his bat. Relief is writ large in the form of a huge"
780,"Innings break So Warne's entertaining innings finally comes to an end, removed by Panesar, to make that particular duel 1-1 for this match. Australia will be pleased with their efforts, a lead of 102. There will be ten minutes before Strauss and Cook head out."
781,"2.30pm A team huddle for Australia, patting and bonding going on. Oh hey now, some handbags are being waved about out there - metaphorically, naturally - Strauss and Ponting are having a real ding-dong. No idea what that's about.
