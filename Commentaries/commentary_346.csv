301,"Jordan to Faulkner, OUT slightly back of a length and darting across Faulkner, Buttler throws himself down the leg side to take a sharp catch - was there a bit of glove on that? Umpire Dar thinks so but Faulkner immediately reviews. He thinks it flicked his sweater - and it did, but not before tickling the inside edge of the bat, Hot Spot clearly shows the mark and the decision is upheld. England have another"
302,"Jordan to Fawad, no run dug in short and at Fawad's bonce, he manages to jerk out of the way"
303,"Jordan to Fawad, FOUR runs shot! Jordan went full and straight but it was more half-volley than yorker and Fawad stepped away, crunched a drive past mid-off for four"
304,"Rankin to McKay, OUT McKay steps to leg, Rankin follows him and the slog across the line goes up in the air, to be safely pouched by the man coming in from deep square leg! Boyd Rankin, the pick of the attack, has a wicket at last and Australia have been bowled out for less than 300"
305,"6.05pm: Er, so how do you sum up that innings? It was helter skelter stuff, another very good Ageas Bowl pitch but Australia looked like they were going to easily get 350 at one stage; England will be delighted to have kept the target below 300, though 299 will still be a record chase here. Ben Stokes was the major beneficiary of Australia's bout of motion sickness but, spinners aside, the bowlers gave a decent account of themselves. We'll find out soon enough whether Shane Watson's (almost)"
306,"Welcome back everyone, final knockings of the international summer. Gone quickly hasn't it? Seems just a second ago I was sat here introducing New Zealand. Time flies and the players are on their way out for the last time in 2013 and England need 299 to take the series after a spirited fightback with the ball."
307,"Michael Carberry will be hoping for a few on his home ground. He'll be feeling much better after his half-century in Cardiff. Kevin Pietersen is yet to fire in this series, can he do so here on what is a cracking deck. Hat-trick hero from Cardiff, Clint McKay, to bowl from the Northern End..."

384,"Faulkner to Carberry, OUT full and straight, wraps Carberry on the pads, huge cry for lbw, not out given but Clarke goes for the review. I reckon this is a good effort, Carberry got a long way down the pitch but it did look straight as he missed playing across it. No mark on Hot Spot and Hawk Eye has it crashing into middle stump, good review and Carberry is gone. He tried to shuffle across and create some angle for himself but missed. That he was down the track and possibly outside t"

Aleem Dar thinks about it for a moment and then raises his finger. Bopara doesn't look very confident but decides to review and Hawk-Eye shows it going on to miss leg stump.

520,"Watson to Bopara, no run forward and dropped towards mid-on, Bailey hares in from midwicket and dives, picks up and throws the stumps down in a brilliant piece of work - again - Buttler has dived back in safely though.

542,"Johnson to Bopara, OUT steps to leg and slaps straight to extra cover and now England are dead. Bopara nailed it, creamed it right out of the meat of the bat but couldn't evade extra-cover who's taken a very sharp chance at head height with two hands, a cold night is not the time for those chances but that was very well held. Bopara can't believe it because he couldn't have timed that any better but he's got to go and two wickets at the start of spells have killed any hope England sti"

594,"There we have it then, end of the series, end of the summer and Australia have won by 49 runs a pretty comprehensive victory in this final rubber. They have something to take home with them, it was a pretty torrid tour but in this NatWest series they have got themselves together nicely and played some decent stuff and deserved to take the series, albeit only over three matches. They take the series 2-1 with two easy wins here and in what was the first game at Old Trafford."
595,"Today, for the third time this season, the visitors have enjoyed the conditions far better at the Ageas Bowl. A hard, flat wicket has served up plenty of runs and Shane Watson scored most of them. He was at his brutal best striking 12 fours and six sixes in 143 that motored Australia along having won the toss, Michael Clarke also played another tidy innings and even though they again collapsed at the end of the innings, 298 gave them plenty to bowl at."
596,"And like at Old Trafford, England never threatened to chase down the target. Two calamitous run-outs hampered their cause and they had Michael Carberry and especially Joe Root looking out of touch and struggling to time the ball. It was Eoin Morgan once again that was required to get the chase going. He did but only for so long and Jos Buttler and Ravi Bopara, despite looking pretty good in cameos, had far too much to do. Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay and James Faulkner were again excellent"
597,"Man of the Series goes to the winning Australian captain Michael Clarke, for his ton in Manchester and good showing today."
598,"So that's all she wrote for the summer of 2013. It started with New Zealand causing an upset in the one-dayers before England flexed their muscles in the Tests. Then came the Champions Trophy that was cracking entertainment and a thrilling final between England and India that the hosts managed to throw away. But the big one was the Ashes, it wasn't vintage but we had four highly competitive matches and England won the moments when it mattered to take the Urn 3-0. Some T20 and one-day action"
599,"Less than a month until Australia are back in action, they get their one-day tour to India underway on October 10 with a T20 before seven ODIs. England have some time off before they travel down under for the return Ashes and the first Test gets underway on November 21 in Brisbane. That's the next time you'll hear from Monty and I, we're off for a well-deserved graze in the shires. See you soon..."
