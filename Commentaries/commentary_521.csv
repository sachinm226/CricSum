,Data
0,"PD Collingwood to North, no run nicely driven by North, stepping well forward, but straight to cover"
1,"PD Collingwood to North, no run Collingwood pulls the length back, but keeps the line wide of off, and North isn't interested in a shot"
2,"PD Collingwood to North, 1 run North is forward in defence, the ball takes the inside half of the bat and rolls to midwicket. Hussey calls immediately for one, and they charge through"
3,"PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Hussey, this time, leaves a wide delivery well alone"
4,"PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run legcutter, slower through the air and Hussey is taken somewhat by surprise as it's quite short too. He wears that one on the chest as Collingwood belts out an appeal, not sure why"
5,"PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run full and driven once again, but they just can't find a crack in this offside field"
6,"Swann to North, no run North hangs back and defends back to the bowler"
7,"Swann to North, no run he leans back once again, hoping to seize upon a touch of width. But the forcing shot goes straight to point"
8,"Swann to North, no run watchful defence this time"
9,"Swann to North, no run driven back elegantly towards Swann, who dives to his right and pulls off a great stop"
10,"Swann to North, no run tossed up teasingly! But it's met with decent defence"
11,"Swann to North, no run and a leave to finish the over - a maiden"
12,"Finn to Hussey, no run loosener outside off, Hussey has a look and opts to play no stroke"
13,"Finn to Hussey, no run a bit more spice in this delivery, as Hussey hops back to defend"
14,"Finn to Hussey, no run fuller on off stump, Hussey leans forward and defends to cover"
15,"Finn to Hussey, no run nicely timed off the back foot to cover, but again England's defensive ring in the covers is impossible to break through"
16,"Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs ah, this time he finds the gap! Too full from Finn, and Hussey launches into a cracking drive. He finds the gap at cover point and the ball is over the rope in a flash"
17,"Finn to Hussey, 3 runs more runs! Through the leg side this time. Again just too full from Finn and Hussey threads the gap between mid-on and midwicket. Hard running - a real effort in this heat - fetches him three runs"
18,"Swann to Hussey, no run solid defence from Mr. Cricket"
19,"Swann to Hussey, no run and more of the same, as the Barmy Army suddenly come to life"
20,"Swann to Hussey, no run nudged defensively to leg this time"
21,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey jumps out to drive, was that a chance? He drove in the air, but dropping short and slightly wide of the man at a close extra cover"
22,"Swann to North, no run North props forward in defence"
23,"Swann to North, no run slightly short from Swann, North leans back but can't find the gap at point"
24,"Finn to Hussey, no run back of a length, Hussey stands tall and punches to mid-off"
25,"Finn to Hussey, no run pitching closer to the batsman this time, but wider of off and left alone"
26,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run that's a tight run on 35-year-old legs! Hussey taps just to mid-off's left and sets off immediately for one. That could've been close, but he put the fielder under real pressure and he couldn't quite pick it up cleanly"
27,"Finn to North, OUT Finn strikes! North is caught behind! What was he trying to do here? A shot of some sort was on, there was width on offer, but he pushed limply at it - barely moving his feet - to send a thin edge through to Prior"
28,"Finn to Haddin, 1 wide Haddin is immediately greeted by a brute of a bouncer, but buckles his knees in time to slip underneath it"
29,"Finn to Haddin, no run back of a length, Haddin hops across to defend"
30,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run and Haddin is away, tapping just wide of mid-off for a scampered single"
31,"Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin stays on the back foot, defending back down the track"
32,"Swann to Haddin, no run and again, still not much at all in the way of spin for Swann as Haddin defends off the back foot"
33,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run slightly wider, chopped down through gully for one"
34,"Swann to Hussey, no run"
35,"Swann to Hussey, no run"
36,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey skips up the wicket merrily and fiddles this towards midwicket"
37,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn begins what could well be the last over before tea with a length ball around off stump that Haddin seems to have an age to play off the back foot"
38,"Finn to Haddin, no run similar line, similar length but Haddin was a touch more rushed on the shot here, no alarm mind"
39,"Finn to Haddin, no run perhaps if it wasn't 5 for 159 and if it wasn't the last over before tea Haddin would have had a dart at this outside off, as it is, he leaves alone"
40,"Finn to Haddin, no run more careful defence from Haddin, he started like that in Brisbane and we all know where that went"
41,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn invites an attacking stroke with a drive-me full ball, Haddin drives but carefully to mid-off"
42,"Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin is so keen on leaving alone that he allows this to thud into his arm, strange end to the session"
43,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey starts as he's done all day, by chipping down the wicket and flicking to leg, where Broad fields smartly"
44,"Swann to Hussey, no run turned more gently into the leg side"
45,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey again running down the wicket, and running back again quickly as he pats straight to Swann who aims a throw"
46,"Swann to Hussey, no run driven crisply straight to short cover where Strauss fields and throws in a flash"
47,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run finally Hussey stays in his crease to play and does so well, pushing to mid-on and setting off straight away for a tight, but safe single"
48,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run Haddin hasn't tried anything expansive as yet and works this off his pads around the corner for a single"
49,"Anderson to Haddin, no run accurate start, it's amazing how accurate he has become actually, this is heading to the off stump before Haddin defends comfortably"
50,"Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin plays back to a ball that keeps a little bit low and defends to cover"
51,"Anderson to Haddin, no run the England fielders like this, they are an optimistic bunch though, Haddin pushed a little hard at the ball to short cover"
52,"Anderson to Haddin, no run Collingwood fields smartly at short extra and earns coos of loving approval from his team-mates"
53,"Anderson to Haddin, no run driven again firmly, securely but straight to the fielder"
54,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs hint on inswing from Anderson but only onto the middle of Haddin's blade as he sweetly times an on-drive wide of mid-on"
55,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run mid-off is set deep to Hussey, who again has played Swann sublimely, and he picks off a riskless single by pushing to that man"
56,"Swann to Haddin, no run careful defence from Haddin, taking his time here"
57,"Swann to Haddin, 3 runs powerfully struck, deserved four but the straight drive banged into Swann's toe, he's hobbling about now and for once not smiling. In fact, he looks in a bit of trouble"
58,"Swann to Hussey, no run After a delay Swann bowls and bowls well, drawing Hussey into an open-faced defensive prod"
59,"Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs wow, wonderful batting again, Hussey skips quickly down the track to make this into a half-volley and clips this with perfect timing and placement wide of midwicket for four"
60,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run follows up the boundary with a well-taken single to keep the strike"
61,"Anderson to Hussey, no run a fraction fuller invites a drive that picks out cover"
62,"Anderson to Hussey, no run this does offer to hold it's line from around the wicket, just a fraction too wide to make Hussey play"
63,"Anderson to Hussey, no run similar line of attack, outside off stump, Hussey happy to let them go by at this stage"
64,"Anderson to Hussey, no run close enough to draw a shot here, but it's nothing more or less than a defensive block"
65,"Anderson to Hussey, no run nicely done from Matt Prior tumbling to his right to ensure Anderson's wild leg-sided ball costs nothing"
66,"Swann to Haddin, no run tossed up a bit from Swann, Haddin casually pushes back to the bowler"
67,"Swann to Haddin, no run quicker ball hurries Haddin into a defence"
68,"Swann to Haddin, 3 runs lovely shot, Haddin has been waiting from Swann to err in length, this is just a touch short and he back-cuts very stylishly for three. Very stylish player Haddin"
69,"Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs Hussey has troubled Swann all series and shapes to come down the wicket again, unsettles Swann enough to earn a full toss which he gleefully whips wide of midwicket for four"
70,"Swann to Hussey, no run follows up the boundary with careful defence, as well he might"
71,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey forward, lines this up perfectly and defends"
72,"Anderson to Haddin, no run back of a length from Anderson, forces Haddin to play off the back foot but without any rush at all"
73,"Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller this time but again more careful Haddin defence"
74,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run Haddin is again on the back foot, literally rather than metaphorically, nudging this with a hint of inside edge to square leg for one"
75,"Anderson to Hussey, no run I can't remember the last time Hussey played a false shot, it's ridiculous, here he defends"
76,"Anderson to Hussey, no run this comes back with the angle from around the wicket and tucks Hussey up in defence"
77,"Broad to Haddin, no run starts straight and forces defence from Haddin"
78,"Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin has been quite subdued, which is testament to the England bowlers"
79,"Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin's sweet drive finds a man placed just for the shot at short extra cover"
80,"Broad to Haddin, no run miserly work from Broad, hugging off stump with his line, Haddin is resolute in defence"
81,"Broad to Haddin, no run once again Haddin can do nothing but defend, but does so with ease"
82,"Broad to Haddin, no run Broad has bowled very well for no reward today, bet he fancies a go with the second new ball when the time comes. He'll be hoping England have exposed Harris by then"
83,"Anderson to Hussey, no run Anderson switches back to over the wicket but his line remains good, as does Hussey's defence"
84,"Anderson to Hussey, no run just a touch short and Hussey, being the wanton warrior he is, was on the pull in flash, sadly he was a touch too quick and bottom-edged straight into his unmentionables"
85,"Anderson to Hussey, no run less incident here, just solemn defence"
86,"Anderson to Hussey, 2 runs good cricket, Anderson testing Hussey with one that was a fraction wider of off, Hussey uses the width to steer carefully past point for a couple"
87,"Anderson to Hussey, no run drive me pleads Anderson with a fuller length, okay says Hussey but straight to the fielder"
88,"Anderson to Hussey, no run tidy over ends with sturdy defence from Hussey, good discipline from both men"
89,"Broad to Haddin, no run huge appeal from Broad as this fuller ball nips back and traps Haddin on the pads, probably heading down but it kept a little low"
90,"Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin has his head firmly down in gritty defence, good to watch actually"
91,"Broad to Haddin, 1 run Haddin drives crisply back at the bowler who does well to get a hand down on it and take the pace off, alas Pietersen at mid-off fluffs the follow-up work and allows the single"
92,"Broad to Hussey, no run Broad from around the wicket floats up a speculative is-there-any-reverse length, and no, there isn't here as Hussey lets it go by outside off"
93,"Broad to Hussey, 1 run just a fraction short and, even though it's well outside off, Hussey back and pulling in a flash, didn't time it though and it trickled wide of mid-on for a single"
94,"Broad to Haddin, 1 run Haddin gets a short ball that he fiddles around the corner with the minimum of fuss and risk to keep the strike"
95,"Finn to Haddin, no run decent start to the new spell, back of a length, outside off, defended carefully"
96,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run diving work from the salmon-like Bell at cover keeps this well-timed drive to a single, too full again from Finn, but better full than short"
97,"Finn to Hussey, no run everything was straight here, straight ball goes straight off the wicket straight into the middle of a very straight bat. Hussey and Finn are both very straight characters as well"
98,"Finn to Hussey, 1 leg bye Finn errs in line, drifting on to the pads and Hussey picks off a single to punish him for it"
99,"Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin has lots of time to play, which is the sort of thing wise sages of the game like to see in a batsman"
100,"Finn to Haddin, no run very sure defence to end a decent comeback over from Finn"
101,"Broad to Hussey, no run Broad finds a good line from his around-the-wicket approach, he also finds Hussey's solid defence"
102,"Broad to Hussey, no run hint of a false shot here as Hussey defends with the inside-half of the bat. Told you it was just a hint"
103,"Broad to Hussey, no run this is a proper false-shot, Hussey bottom-edged a cut that was too close to him to play, bounces away harmlessly"
104,"Broad to Hussey, 1 run this one is wide enough to cut and Hussey does so well enough to pick up a single to deep point"
105,"Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin defends quietly to end the over. Excitingly Pietersen is ready to renter the field so whatever his ankle issue was must have cleared up"
106,"Finn to Hussey, no run Finn goes full and finds the inside-half of the bat as Hussey drives, goes back to the bowler who fields with one hand"
107,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run Finn loses his line a fraction, but it's a game of fractions I'm told, and Hussey works this to leg for a single"
108,"Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin times a full-faced drive nicely, but straight to mid-off"
109,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn has been fairly decent this spell, sticking to an off-stump line"
110,"Finn to Haddin, no run Finn has been feeding Haddin's drive with men set for the shot at short cover, this is played all along the ground though"
111,"Finn to Haddin, no run strange shot this, aimless dab outside off stump, kept a bit low and it ghosted past the edge, on replay that really was a poor shot"
112,"Swann to Hussey, 3 runs ah Hussey again down the track and flicking superbly to deep midwicket where KP makes a hash of a slide and stop, doesn't cost anything but Swann is not impressed"
113,"Swann to Haddin, no run quietly prodded into the off side"
114,"Swann to Haddin, no run neat and careful defence from Haddin who has been monastic with his patience today"
115,"Swann to Haddin, 2 runs that's the reward for patience, a touch of width, a touch short and a very delicate late cut past slip for a couple"
116,"Swann to Haddin, no run slightly quicker this time and Haddin hurries in defence"
117,"Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin works this into the leg side to end Swann's comeback over"
118,"Finn to Hussey, no run more line and length stuff from Finn, which is no bad thing, Hussey defends. Cripes Hussey is in the 90s now, almost by stealth, just been so busy and bustling"
119,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run picked off to deep midwicket with a flick of the wrists"
120,"Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin, who is the most Australian looking man you ever see, defends studiously on the back foot"
121,"Finn to Haddin, 3 runs ah, the wonders of soft hands, nicely played, runs off the face down towards third man, some lung-busting running earns three"
122,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run tap and run from Hussey, doesn't he do that well"
123,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run good delivery here from Finn, quicker and yorker length, doesn't quite squeeze through as Haddin clamps down in time for a single"
124,"Swann to Haddin, no run huge swipe! First ball, Haddin goes for a slog sweep and, luckily for him, the ball doesn't turn in, scooting just past the off stump"
125,"Swann to Haddin, no run that's more like it, he opts for defence this time"
126,"Swann to Haddin, no run pushed defensively into the leg side"
127,"Swann to Haddin, no run more defence from Haddin"
128,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run and he rotates the strike with a little nudge behind square on the leg side"
129,"Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey leaps onto the front foot and opens the face of the bat, guiding the ball to backward point"
130,"Finn to Haddin, no run what did that hit? It's an old ball but Finn's found some life in it yet, getting this one to nip away and beat the outside edge of a stodgy prod from Haddin"
131,"Finn to Haddin, no run and again! Finn is reversing it here. He's holding it like an inswinger but it's snaking away late through the air, and Haddin's outside edge is beaten with consecutive deliveries"
132,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run fuller this time, right on off stump and Haddin taps through cover for one"
133,"Finn to Hussey, 1 run short and quick from Finn, hurrying Hussey's hook out to the man on the fence at deep square"
134,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run this one holds its line, and Haddin nurdles off his left leg for one to bring up the 50 stand"
135,"Finn to Hussey, no run Finn comes round the wicket, spearing the ball down at the off stump to have Hussey pressing forward in careful defence"
136,"Swann to Haddin, no run quick through the air from Swann, Haddin presents the full face in defence"
137,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run tossed up slightly fuller, Haddin flicks down to long-on to get Hussey back on strike"
138,"Swann to Hussey, OUT he's gone! Hussey is gone in the 90s, and Swann has finally spun one appreciably! Hussey was forward and across, leaning into a drive, and the ball took a thick edge to land in Collingwood's lap at slip"
139,"Swann to Harris, OUT Huge appeal for lbw, Harris is totally done in the flight and the ball thumps into the back pad. He wasn't too far forward, the umpire raises the finger but Harris asks for the review. Has he hit that? Is it missing leg? Nope, he's given out!"
140,"Swann to Doherty, no run nervous defence from Doherty for the hat-trick ball! Slip, short gully, silly mid-off and short leg were all in"
141,"Swann to Doherty, no run and slightly more certain defence from Doherty to finish the over"
142,"Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs right, Haddin's decided he's got to open up now, and he steps away to leg to slash this through the off side. He doesn't quite get all of it, but a thick edge flies down to third man"
143,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run back of a length, pushed out in front of a diving Pietersen at point and they take the single"
144,"Finn to Doherty, no run pushed wide of off on a length, Doherty has a look and lets it go"
145,"Finn to Doherty, no run closer to the off stump this time, but not close enough to get Doherty to play a shot"
146,"Finn to Doherty, no run on a length and straight this time, Doherty is slightly late getting the bat down in defence and is struck on the thigh"
147,"Finn to Doherty, no run this time Doherty steps forward and across to drive, but the ball goes straight to extra cover"
148,"Swann to Haddin, no run fizzing down on a length outside off, this one goes straight on as Haddin defends"
149,"Swann to Haddin, no run again Haddin opts to play from the crease, defending back down the track"
150,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run this time he's forward and right across to the off side, the ball squirts past the man at short leg and the sprint through for one"
151,"Swann to Doherty, 2 runs drift and turn again for Swann! He comes round the wicket and finds the outer half of Doherty's bat, but the batsman was well forward and played with soft hands to pick up two to short third man"
152,"Swann to Doherty, no run quicker ball, speared in at off stump, but Doherty is solid in defence"
153,"Swann to Doherty, no run very full on off stump, dug out to mid-off"
154,"Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin's muscular forearms send the ball arcing over mid-on! Nothing but a firm punch, he checked the shot but lofted it in the air and well over the man at mid-on. Great shot, sweet timing"
155,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run chopped down to third man, that'll just be one"
156,"Finn to Doherty, no run pushed wider of off this time, Doherty leaves"
157,"Finn to Doherty, FOUR runs full and wide once again, this time Doherty latches onto it with a flashing square drive. Not a bad shot for a No. 9!"
158,"Finn to Doherty, no run very short on middle, Doherty is not a tall man and gets underneath it quite easily"
159,"Swann to Haddin, no run slow through the air from Swann, Haddin backs to leg and tries to run it down to third man. An athletic stop and return from Collingwood makes sure that doesn't happen"
160,"Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin plays back, tapping it back to the bowler"
161,"Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin bends down into another slog sweep, again he fails to connect and this time he's hit on the pad. That looked to be hitting him outside the line, but England have asked for a review ... Yep, he's hit marginally outside the line, so that's not out. And England have no more reviews to play with"
162,"Swann to Haddin, no run full outside off, this time Haddin gets forward to defend"
163,"Swann to Haddin, 1 run turn and bounce! The ball spits off a length, taking the shoulder of the bat and running down to fine leg"
164,"Swann to Doherty, no run Swann comes round the wicket and tosses one up outside off, Doherty gets right forward but then whips his bat out of the way to leave"
165,"Finn to Haddin, 1 run pitched up outside off, Haddin drives out to deep extra cover"
166,"Finn to Doherty, no run round the wicket comes Finn, hurling it down on a length to have Doherty defending from the crease"
167,"Finn to Doherty, no run fuller, wider, but Doherty won't be tempted"
168,"Finn to Doherty, no run this one moves in off the seam and also appears to keep just a touch low, but Doherty is watching it closely and gets the bat down to defend in good time"
169,"Finn to Doherty, no run tucked to mid-on's right, the fielder sprints round to cut off the single"
170,"Finn to Doherty, no run aimed at the top of off, but it's met with watchful defence as Doherty survives another over"
171,"Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin leans forward to defend"
172,"Swann to Haddin, no run again Australia's keeper is forward, defending towards mid-on"
173,"Swann to Haddin, OUT Doherty, ball-watching, is run out! Haddin stepped across to the off side, nudging into the leg side for what should have been a single. It was always going to be tight, but he could've got home if he'd set off straight away. Haddin called for it as soon as he hit it, but Doherty wasn't sure and lingered"
174,"Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle stretches out to defend his first ball"
175,"Swann to Siddle, no run flighted outside off, defended once again"
176,"Anderson to Siddle, no run and there's movement straight away! Some curve through the air and real movement off the seam away from the bat, and Siddle doesn't even get close to it"
177,"Anderson to Siddle, no run pitching on a length on middle, swinging towards off, but Siddle defends"
178,"Anderson to Siddle, no run swinging towards the slips once again, but it moves early and Siddle is able to leave alone quite safely"
179,"Anderson to Siddle, no run that's drawn him into the stroke! Landing on middle and off, jagging away, and Siddle's not good enough to get a touch on that. Close to unplayable"
180,"Anderson to Siddle, no run and again! This time Siddle whipped the bat inside the line, but only after the ball had burst past the outside edge"
181,"Anderson to Siddle, no run this is slightly too wide of off and moving further away, Siddle plays well inside the line"
182,"Broad to Haddin, no run full, and Broad too finds some away shape straight away. Haddin steps forward and attempts a square drive but finds Pietersen at point"
183,"Broad to Haddin, 1 run slanting into the pads this time, and Haddin puts him away to deep square leg for one"
184,"Broad to Siddle, no run too wide to get Siddle playing, left alone"
185,"Broad to Siddle, 2 runs runs for Siddle, he gets on top of the bounce and angles the ball down between the second and third slips for a couple. Intentionally played, and dropping well short of the fielders"
186,"Broad to Siddle, no run beaten on the drive! It was full and, in Siddle's eyes, drivable. But the movement away took it past the outside edge"
187,"Broad to Siddle, no run and again the ball hoops past the edge! Top quality swing bowling here, that was right up to the batsman and swinging away appreciably"
188,"Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs ... who steps to leg and chips up and over cover for a couple. Big gap there, and they get two"
189,"Anderson to Haddin, no run he's worn one, and that will have hurt! Haddin backed to leg again, but this time Anderson followed him with the short ball. It hit him on the wrist and then the chest. If it did hurt, he's not showing it"
190,"Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs clipped behind square on the leg side, the man is slow coming in off the fence and they're back for the second, much to Prior's annoyance"
191,"Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs short, hooked off his nose down to fine leg where Trott charges round and completes a good, sliding stop"
192,"Anderson to Haddin, SIX runs scooped over fine leg for six! What a shot. He backed to leg again, this time Anderson followed him with a full inswinger that looked to be heading down the leg side ... but Haddin somehow connected with it, and well! And that's his fifty"
193,"Anderson to Haddin, no run full, yorker length and swinging away. The ball dips under the bat, and Anderson ambles down to have a quick word with Haddin. Congratulating him on a good innings, perhaps"
194,"Broad to Siddle, no run Broad finds a full and straight length to Siddle who defends, without looking all that sure"
195,"Broad to Siddle, no run too short to interest Siddle, who pops under it"
196,"Broad to Siddle, no run Broad reverts to a length but finds a very sensible defensive prod from Siddle"
197,"Broad to Siddle, no run resounding clunk as Siddle defends very confidently off the front foot"
198,"Broad to Siddle, no run Broad aiming for the top of off and Siddle is more than up for the challenge"
199,"Broad to Siddle, no run excellent batting from Siddle, clear about what he has to do, which is hang around, and leaves well alone to set up another Haddin v Anderson battle"
200,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run just a single taken this time and Haddin is happy for Siddle to face, pushed down to long-on for a jogged single, suspect Anderson won't mind that"
201,"Anderson to Siddle, no run worked off the pads a touch uppishly to square leg but no real alarm"
202,"Anderson to Siddle, OUT this time he's gone! Haddin's gamble doesn't come off as this is again clipped off the legs uppishly, but this time reaching Cook who pouches the chance to give Anderson his fourth"
203,"Anderson to Bollinger, no run ooh, good ball, full and straight, swinging in a touch, Bollinger was solid on the jabbed defence"
204,"Anderson to Bollinger, no run big appeal from the bowler but it was probably swinging past leg and going over. Not a lot going for it really"
205,"Anderson to Bollinger, no run slightly slower, Anderson concentrating on length and line, finds a squeezed inside-edge from Bollinger"
206,"Broad to Haddin, no run Bollinger wants a single, of course he does, Haddin doesn't though as it's pushed gently to long-on"
207,"Broad to Haddin, 2 runs ah lovely cricket from Haddin, leg-stump delivery he picks off into a gap between long-on and deep midwicket for a couple"
208,"Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin backs away looking for something expansive, Broad doesn't blink and it ends up dribbling away into the off side off a toe-end"
209,"Broad to Haddin, OUT All over now! Broad finally gets a deserved wicket as he digs in a short ball that Haddin top-edges it sails high down to Finn on the fine leg boundary who makes no mistake"
210,"Good resistance from Haddin but that's a fine, fine effort from England's bowlers. Ideal start to the second Test for the tourists after being asked to field first. Anderson was the pick, finishing with 4 for 51, but the attack hunted in a pack and hassled the Australian line-up into submission. As history suggests, Adelaide is not"
211,Look out Alastair Cook! Pietersen's last hundred was against West Indies in March last year.
212,"Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs lovely shot! Harris goes full and Pietersen steps into it and clips firmly past mid-on and it races away for four to bring him on to 99"
213,"Harris to Pietersen, 1 run century for Pietersen, he punches the air! Short ball from Harris, Pietersen stood tall again and dropped it into the leg side to scamper through to the landmark"
214,"Harris to Cook, 2 runs runs flowing this morning, overpitched and Cook leans into an extra-cover drive for a couple more"
215,"Harris to Cook, no run nothing at all happening with the new ball, Cook has an age to defend of the back foot"
216,"Harris to Cook, no run clipped off the pads firmly to midwicket"
217,"Harris to Cook, no run driven crisply again this time but straight to extra cover"
218,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run full from Bollinger but too wide to interest Pietersen"
219,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run beaten! Ball actually goes past the edge of bat! Merciful. Good delivery from Bollinger, slower ball and Pietersen was in position far too early"
220,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs emphatic response from the batsman, horrid ball to be fair, short and sitting up, Pietersen thwacked it well in front of square for four"
221,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run short again and nudged around the corner for another single"
222,"Bollinger to Cook, no run quiet and resolute defence. Spirit-sapping stuff if you're an Australian"
223,"Bollinger to Cook, no run Cook steps forward and presents the fullest of faces to a length ball"
224,"Harris to Pietersen, no run woah! Pietersen gets in a horrid tangle here. Sharp bounces, Pietersen was getting forward and aimed a hook but it was on him in a flash and thudded into his gloves near his face, he had no idea what was going on"
225,"Harris to Pietersen, 1 run and again! Very sharp bouncer, Pietersen wanted to make a statement by taking it on but it was too quick for him and he ended up skewing over the infield into space. Lucky"
226,"Harris to Cook, 2 runs oops! Misfield from Clarke at cover allows a routine push to cover to become two"
227,"Harris to Cook, OUT Alastair Cook is out! Finally. Harris deserved that, sharp ball on a good length, Cook was back when he should have been forward and it came back between bat and pad, clipping a faint inside edge and Haddin took a good catch diving to his right"
228,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run good ball first up, hanging around off stump, Collingwood reluctant to get forward and jabs a defence"
229,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood looks a little flat footed and stabs a defence to a length ball outside off"
230,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Pietersen looks in the mood to dominate, or try to at least, he swishes hard at a drive and doesn't time it"
231,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run pushed across Pietersen with the left-armer angle, left alone outside off"
232,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs extraordinary shot, Pietersen skips down the wicket outside off stump to whip this in front of midwicket for four"
233,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run in response Bollinger shoves this well outside off and Pietersen isn't tempted"
234,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run slammed to mid-off, Bollinger down on pace and serving up a full delivery that Pietersen goes very hard at"
235,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs yup, Pietersen is clearly wanting to entertain which makes things exciting, if a little insecure, this is flapped over mid-off, not timed but it loops over for a couple"
236,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run starts outside off and left alone, Harris full of grimaces. Doesn't look good"
237,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run again Collingwood gets a sighter outside off stump and again Harris looks plenty uncomfortable"
238,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run touch of extra bounce here, good wheels too but too wide of off to interest a new batsman"
239,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood forced to defend and does so comfortably enough off the back foot"
240,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run good pace and carry but the line is still too wide"
241,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run end of a tidy over, Harris didn't look very comfortable throughout though"
242,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run this is indeed banged in short, sharpish too and Pietersen had to pull out of an attempted hook shot at the last minute"
243,"Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs well Siddle is trying to buy a wicket and if the short balls don't get up it is going to cost plenty, this doesn't and Pietersen was waiting for it, pulled powerfully with one leg up in the air"
244,"Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs Pietersen was waiting in position for this very early, set himself up like a baseball player ready to swing a pull shot, Siddle serves up a half-tracker and it's slapped to the boundary"
245,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run short again, this time the pull shot finds the fielder but Pietersen is clearly expecting the tactic"
246,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run order restored with Collingwood leaving alone outside off stump"
247,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run fuller and attacking off stump, good delivery really and Collingwood defends off an inside edge. 10 balls on 0 now"
248,"Harris to Pietersen, 1 run no bouncer this time, instead it's the double bluff, very full and meets an even fuller face, pushing to mid-on for a swift single"
249,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood remains pinned on 0, but no alarm, just leaving outside off"
250,"Harris to PD Collingwood, no run slightly tired delivery this time, down on pace and outside off stump, left all alone"
251,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 4 runs Collingwood is away with an all-run four, not sure the fielding was very sharp there, pushed past mid-off with a hint of inside edge"
252,"Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run edgy drive goes all along the ground towards point where it bursts through the hands"
253,"Harris to Pietersen, no run another edge, inside this time and it trickles to mid-on"
254,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run beaten, poor shot to a good ball, fullish outside off, Collingwood just pushed at it a fraction"
255,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 2 runs better shot this time, Collingwood standing tall and punching through cover for a couple"
256,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood much more secure in defence this time, crunching forward to block"
257,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length, Collingwood punches a block"
258,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 4 byes swing! Actual, real bonafide swing! Happened after it past the batsman, just curled past a diving Haddin to run away for four. Looked like reverse as well, so it's possible"
259,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run swings again after passing the stumps, and after such a barren day yesterday, it's good to see some movement"
260,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run hurled down flat and fast to start, and Doherty is lucky to get away with this one as it's short and wide - slapped straight to short extra cover"
261,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run KP has a look and taps back to the bowler"
262,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run tossed up a lot slower and fuller, a touch of grip off the surface but nothing extravagant"
263,"Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs Doherty slips down the leg side and is promptly swept down to fine leg. Strong shoot, he just helped it on its way"
264,"Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run eased to wide mid-on"
265,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Collingwood finds the boundary with a classic nurdle - a no-nonsense bottom-handed shovel that threads the gap at midwicket and races away"
266,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run full and quite wide, Pietersen flings a flashing square drive at the ball to send it out to deep point"
267,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run straighter from Siddle, and Collingwood steps forward to drive to mid-off"
268,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length this time. Collingwood doesn't move his feet much but defends right under his eyes effectively enough"
269,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run this time Collingwood shuffles half forward to a good length delivery just outside off and defends to cover"
270,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run inside edge! Collingwood was looking to clip to midwicket, a thick edge struck the back pad and Pietersen called him through for a sharp single straight away"
271,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run just a defensive push from Pietersen, but it springs off the middle of the bat with a real crack. Straight to extra cover though, so no run"
272,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs flighted very full on leg stump, Collingwood steps forward and almost yorks himself but jams the bat down hard to send the ball into the leg side - via a ricochet off Katich under the helmet at short leg"
273,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs again Collingwood aims leg side to a full delivery, more authoritative stroke this time and they get back for the second"
274,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Colly stays deep in the crease and defends to cover"
275,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run fuller on off stump - a decent, if not dangerous, delivery - is defended off the front foot"
276,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood lunges forward to defend once more"
277,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run much quicker through the air, really fired in, and Collingwood is beaten by the extra pace as the ball thuds into his pad. Going well down leg though"
278,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run length delivery thumped on the up - and on the walk - to mid-off"
279,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run punched hard through the off side for one"
280,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs this wasn't all that short, but Collingwood picked up the length very early and set himself for a powerful pull through midwicket"
281,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs through the off side this time! Driven on the up wide of mid-off with a resounding crack off the bat, great timing. Up comes the fifty partnership"
282,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run aimed right at middle and much fuller, Collingwood digs it out towards mid-on"
283,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run landing on a length just outside off and seaming away off the pitch, Collingwood steps forward into a leave"
284,"Doherty to Pietersen, SIX runs up, up and over long-off! Is that England's first six of the series? You'd have backed KP to hit it. Slapped inside-out over the infield after a confident shimmy down the track"
285,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run turn and bounce for Doherty, but unfortunately the ball landed well outside off stump and Pietersen had nothing to do with it"
286,"Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run driven hard out to the cover boundary"
287,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run defended watchfully into the covers"
288,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood is back and defending this time"
289,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up gently on middle, Collingwood steps forward to smother what spin there is"
290,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is beaten on the drive. He needn't have played at this one, it was full but very wide and seamed further away off the pitch"
291,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run this time he opts for safety and raises his arms above his head to shoulder arms to a length delivery outside off"
292,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run same ball, same result. Siddle is just getting a little bit out of this old-ish ball in overcast conditions. More off the pitch than through the air"
293,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run well, having said that this one goes dead straight through the air and then does absolutely nothing off the pitch. Well outside off though, and left alone once more"
294,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run Siddle is testing Pietersen's patience outside the off stump here, landing this on a length and a foot away from him on the off side. Pietersen resists the urge, and leaves alone"
295,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 wide a rash drive! This was really wide, it went away through the air and off the pitch and Pietersen just threw the bat at it. Lucky not to edge that. It's so wide that it's called as such by the umpire"
296,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run and another leave to finish the over as Pietersen decides, wisely, not to play at this"
297,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run more turn and bounce for Doherty, but again it's much too far away from the batsman to get him playing"
298,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run extravagant turn and bounce this time! This almost evaded Haddin's reach outside off it turned so much. Landed in a foot-hole, but they're quite far outside off"
299,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run defended off the front foot this time"
300,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run more watchful, cautious batting from Collingwood"
301,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run too short from Doherty, width on offer too, but Collingwood slaps it straight to cover"
302,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs whipped off the back foot out to long leg"
303,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs Pietersen walks down towards the off side and flicks cheekily out on the leg side, plenty of space there"
304,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run pushed wider of off, left alone by Pietersen"
305,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs a 7/2 offside field, but again Bollinger aims at leg stump and is clipped to fine leg. Punter is nonplussed"
306,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run that's the plan, outside off and on a length. Pietersen leaves"
307,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run even further away from the off stump this time. Pietersen steps forward aggressively, but whips his bat up to leave"
308,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run accurate finish to the over, landing just outside off and Pietersen gets some bat on this one - but only to defend"
309,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run nice and full, just outside off. Collingwood steps forward and pushes to cover"
310,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs too full on leg stump, and Collingwood's bottom hand sends the ball out to the deep midwicket boundary. Easily done"
311,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Doherty adjusts his line to off stump, Collingwood defends"
312,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run worked firmly into the leg side, but the ball thumps into Katich at short leg. Ouch"
313,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs four more to the midwicket boundary with a powerful front foot nurdle. 100 up for Doherty, and he's disconsolate"
314,"Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run a mercifully defensive end to the over by Collingwood as he defends to off"
315,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Bollinger persists with this outside-off-stump line, and Pietersen isn't tempted - yet"
316,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run appeal for lbw from the bowler, but that's hopelessly optimistic. Huge inside edge onto the pad"
317,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Pietersen leans forward into a solid defence"
318,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run full, wide, and left alone. Australia are just hoping for a mistake from Pietersen here"
319,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run a tempting line on or around off stump, but Pietersen pulls his bat inside the line as the ball passes him. Left, rather than beaten"
320,"North to PD Collingwood, no run big turn straight away for the offpsinner! That's turned a foot from outside off. That'll please Swann..."
321,"North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs turn and bounce again, Collingwood gets across to off and rides it to pick up two to fine leg"
322,"North to PD Collingwood, no run arm ball, outside off, and it rushes straight on. Spotted by Collingwood, who leaves"

324,"North to PD Collingwood, no run pushed defensively to cover off the back foot"
325,"North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs a touch too short, Collingwood hangs back and aims a delicate late cut behind square for a couple more"
326,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 wide no pace in the delivery, but slammed in halfway down. That balloons over the batsman, and is called wide. Dougie doesn't like it, and to be honest that was a slightly harsh call"
327,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run angled full and very wide across Pietersen, who steps across to leave"
328,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run full of length on off stump, Pietersen shuffles across and clips just wide of midwicket for one"
329,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run very full, very wide and left alone. Yawn"
330,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run just short of a good length, pitching on off stump. Solidly defended by Collingwood, right under the eyes"
331,"Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood looks to open up the leg side, stepping right across to off and glancing down to fine leg"
332,"Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs muscled with great authority to the midwicket boundary. There are only two fielders on the leg side - the plan was obviously to continue wide of off - but Bollinger dishes one up full on middle and leg"
333,"North to PD Collingwood, no run full outside off, Collingwood lunges forward to smother the spin"
334,"North to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood skips down the track and is almost beaten in the flight but gets bat and pad right together and picks up one as the ball squirts behind point"
335,"North to Pietersen, FOUR runs that has rocketed to the leg-side boundary! A powerful sweep, mostly along the ground, and he's split the field. 150 for Pietersen"
336,"North to Pietersen, FOUR runs swept again, four more! There are two men out there, but he's got it right between them. A tired-looking Bollinger sprinted round but couldn't get to it"
337,"North to Pietersen, no run forward defence this time"
338,"North to Pietersen, 1 run short, pulled very hard out to Bollinger at deep square"
339,"Watson to Pietersen, no run Watson starts with a full, drive-me ball, Pietersen does drive but not with complete certainty and it runs off the inside edge"
340,"Watson to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is on the drive again and plays it nicely but straight to cover"
341,"Watson to Pietersen, no run Three times Pietersen has made 158 and only once has he gone past it, Watson keeps him pinned on it here with a length ball on off stump"
342,"Watson to Pietersen, no run very firmly driven once more, this was a touch wider though, which is something for the bowler to hang on to"
343,"Watson to Pietersen, no run maiden over and Pietersen remains stuck on 158"
344,"North to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up nicely, Collingwood plays back in defence"
345,"North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs again given plenty of air from North, Collingwood happily pushes square of the wicket on the off side to bring up yet another England 100-run partnership"
346,"North to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood pokes this to a tumbling Katich at short leg. It bounced, before you ask"
347,"North to PD Collingwood, no run more gentle flight from North, pushed away to cover"
348,"North to PD Collingwood, no run this time Collingwood defends a touch squarer"
349,"North to PD Collingwood, no run calm and quiet defence to finish the over"
350,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run fullish delivery clipped around the corner to get Pietersen his highest score against Australia"
351,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run Watson is very straight, as is Collingwood's defensive blade"
352,"Watson to PD Collingwood, no run driven crisply straight to short cover"
353,"Watson to Bell, no run no slips in place for the new batsman, Watson very full and straight, Bell drives stylishly to mid-on and holds the pose for a while. Must have liked it"
354,"Watson to Bell, no run Watson gets a cheer and plenty of loving pats for his wicket-taking over, finishes with Bell defending off the front foot"
355,"North to Pietersen, 1 run North chucks it into the clouds and tempts Pietersen into an almighty swish with minimal footwork, loose shot, and it came off the inside edge wide of mid-on for one"
356,"North to Bell, no run Bell down the wicket straight away but only to nudge this back to North"
357,"North to Bell, no run more expansive this time, Bell skipping up the track and unfurling a drive to mid-off"
358,"North to Bell, FOUR runs Bell gets all of this, dancing down the track for the third time and lifting it stylishly over mid-on's head for four"
359,"North to Bell, 1 run Bell's quick-footed drive finds mid-off but he scampers through for a single"
360,"North to Pietersen, no run Pietersen knocks this into the leg side to finish the over. Be interesting to see if he tries to match Bell shot for shot"
361,"Watson to Bell, no run there is a hint of movement into the right hander which finds the inside edge"
362,"Watson to Bell, no run good length and line from Watson, heading for the top of off, Bell defends"
363,"Watson to Bell, no run studious forward defence"
364,"Watson to Bell, no run well, if only runs were awarded for style, Bell would be on plenty all ready, sadly for him his crisp drive has found a fielder again"
365,"Watson to Bell, no run another maiden for Watson as Bell picks out point with a square drive"
366,"North to Pietersen, no run ooh, Swann will like this, sharp turn and bounce out of the footholes, troubles Pietersen as he defends"
367,"North to Pietersen, no run this is blocked more securely"
368,"North to Pietersen, no run touch wider from North and despite the turn Pietersen is happy to leave alone"
369,"North to Pietersen, no run North drags his length back and allows Pietersen to defend off the back foot"
370,"North to Pietersen, 1 run eased down to long-off for a jogged single"
371,"North to Bell, no run Bell heading down the wicket again, didn't get there and it spun back into him sharply"
372,"Watson to Pietersen, FOUR runs slashed and slashed hard, hint of away movement meant it found something near the edge and flew past point to the boundary"
373,"Watson to Pietersen, no run wide of off again from Watson, Pietersen happy to slash a drive again but this time finds a fielder"
374,"Watson to Pietersen, no run driven firmly and straight back to the bowler"
375,"Watson to Pietersen, no run ooh, close here, Watson is finding just enough indrift to cause trouble, it sneaks back finds an inside edge on to the pad and loops just short of short third man"
376,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run this time Pietersen's drive is solid and it runs to the boundary rider on the off side"
377,"Watson to Bell, no run this is outside off stump and Bell leaves alone"

382,"North to Bell, no run Bell stays in his crease here to defend"
383,"North to Bell, no run pushed through a touch quicker from North and Bell defends"
384,"Watson to Pietersen, no run Watson continues to find a touch of inswing and Pietersen is forced to defend"
385,"Watson to Pietersen, no run driven very hard but straight to the cover fielder"
386,"Watson to Pietersen, 2 runs clipped very cleanly wide of midwicket for a well-run couple"
387,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run ooh, Pietersen has one of his Red Bull moments, pushing straight to the fielder and heading off for a needlessly tight single, he's very swift between the sticks though"
388,"Watson to Bell, 3 runs very full from Watson and flicked fine by Bell, looks like it's heading for four until big Doug tumbles to save by the rope"
389,"Watson to Pietersen, 1 run bit of a heave here from Pietersen, lost his shape on the shot and it skewed off the inside edge down to deep square"
390,"North to Pietersen, no run beaten, sneaks past the outside edge as this pitches and goes on with the arm. Nicely bowled"
391,"North to Pietersen, no run turn and bounce down the leg side and neatly taken by Haddin, always good to see leg-side takes"
392,"North to Pietersen, 1 run no alarm for Pietersen here, clipping down to long-on"
393,"North to Bell, no run North drops just a fraction short and Bell is back and flicking to leg in a flash but Hussey at midwicket makes a good stop"

397,"Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs too full from Siddle and Pietersen steps and crunches into a drive down the ground for four"
398,"Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs oh dear, juicy leg-stump half-volley, Pietersen in any form would knock these away and in form like this there was no doubt, crashing it very firmly all along the ground past midwicket"

413,"Siddle to Bell, no run a touch fuller and invites a drive that Bell pats to cover"
414,"Harris to Pietersen, no run good start to the new spell, precious little off the track but the line is good, the length is good and Pietersen has to defend"

428,"Harris to Pietersen, 4 leg byes down leg again, this time the ball hits the thigh pad and flies down to fine leg"

431,"Harris to Bell, no run more defence from Bell, played right under the eyes and out towards cover point"

437,"Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs all timing, balance and placement as Bell glances to the wide midwicket boundary. Mitchell Johnson, on as a substitute fielder, escorts the ball all the way to the rope and puts in a dive in vain"
438,"Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs thick outside edge as Pietersen pushes flat-footed at a back of a length delivery outside off. Goes through the huge gap - there's just the one slip in - and down to third man. Wouldn't have carried to a slip, even if there had been one"
439,"Harris to Pietersen, no run KP steps forward to defend to cover"
440,"Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen's bottom hand takes over as he whips very firmly but straight to the fielder at midwicket. He's visibly annoyed with himself for missing out on that scoring opportunity - it was a leg-stump half-volley really"

445,"Siddle to Bell, 2 runs short on middle and off, Bell hooks off his nose out to long leg where Dougie Bollinger runs round and slides into a stop ... he didn't quite judge that one right, and ended up basically sitting on the ball. Still, at least he stopped it"
446,"Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs a scything cut shot flies to the cover point boundary! Cracked in front of square, it was over the rope in a flash"

448,"Siddle to Bell, no run this one pitches and straightens slightly outside off, Bell is watching it closely as he raises his bat to leave"
449,"Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs languidly driven through cover! The footwork, timing and placement were all spot on, a real classy shot"
450,"Harris to Pietersen, no run a hint of away swing for Harris there, but it only really moved once it passed the batsman - who had left the ball well alone"
451,"Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen drops the ball towards cover and thinks about a quick single, but Harris sprints across to put such thoughts out of his mind"
452,"Harris to Pietersen, no run defended firmly into the leg side. Pietersen steps away from the crease after playing the shot and seems concerned about something on the end of his finger... Did he break a nail?"

459,"Bollinger to Bell, no run nibbling away slightly off the seam outside off, Bell chops down to gully"

461,"Bollinger to Bell, no run Bell steps into a defensive stroke that goes to mid-off and, against the run of play, that's a maiden"
462,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run Pietersen gets his left leg well forward and defends"
463,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run defended slightly awkwardly back to the bowler"
464,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run and more defence from Pietersen. I smell a big shot coming..."

466,"Doherty to Bell, no run full and driven back to the bowler"
467,"Doherty to Bell, no run spinning away quite sharply outside off, Bell waits for the turn and cuts it away but a tumbling point fielder cuts it off"

474,"Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run driven just wide of mid-off, and there it is! Double-ton up for Pietersen, and that obviously means a lot to him. He roars a celebration and pumps his fist, down on one knee. The bat is raised to all corners of the ground"

476,"Doherty to Bell, no run tossed up slightly slower, and Bell defends"

479,"Doherty to Bell, 1 run Bell dances down and flicks just wide of mid-on. Pietersen hobbles through for a single"
480,"Bollinger to Bell, FOUR runs short, and Bell dismisses it from his presence with an imperious pull. Medium pace, and treated as such"
481,"Bollinger to Bell, no run left alone outside off"

485,"Bollinger to Bell, no run driven again, but not timed nearly as well and this time the ball rolls slowly to mid-off"
486,"Doherty to Pietersen, no run accurate stuff from Doherty, tossed up on middle, and Pietersen defends into the leg side"

495,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Pietersen under-edges an attempted drive, the ball hitting the ground under his bat and bouncing back towards Haddin"
496,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run that's better, slung down outside off and Pietersen raises his bat to leave"
497,"Bollinger to Pietersen, no run fuller outside off, Pietersen aims an exploratory drive at mid-off"
498,"Doherty to Bell, 2 runs premeditated paddle-sweep down to fine leg... Bollinger, understandably weary after completing the last over, is slightly slow to get to it at that position"
499,"Doherty to Bell, 1 run full, driven just wide of point and they take a quick single. Pietersen's hamstring is not totally shot, then"
500,"Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs dispatched straight back over the bowler's head, a clean strike right through the line. Doherty just turns and heads back to his mark"
501,"Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs and again, over mid-off this time! He didn't quite get all of that, but enough on it to reach the rope"

522,"Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs tossed up a fraction around off stump, Pietersen stays in his crease and butchers it over midwicket for four, massive slog sweep brings up his career best"
523,"Doherty to Pietersen, OUT all over! Pietersen falls to left-arm spin again. But not before he'd made 227. Doherty finally tosses up a really slow, widish one outside off, Pietersen aims another almighty heave but it spins away, comes off the toe-end and goes very gently to slip"
524,"Doherty to Prior, no run defends his first ball quietly into the off side"
525,"Doherty to Prior, 3 runs Prior is away, pushing into the covers and gets two because Watson is running painfully slow in pursuit"

528,"Siddle to Prior, no run"
529,"Siddle to Prior, no run Prior gets away with, he was given out lbw to a full ball that swung in late, and a long way, strikes him flush on the pad. Prior opted to review, more out of hope than anything else, and Hawk Eye showed it sliding past leg"

535,"Doherty to Bell, 1 run driven to long off with no fuss at all to bring up another serene Bell fifty"
536,"Doherty to Prior, 2 runs oh no! Prior top-edges a sweep over square leg, Pointing running back after it, North running in for it, they both pull out at the last moment and it plops down between them"

557,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run swiped, across the line, out to deep midwicket"
558,"Again, grovelling apologies for the technical issue that delayed our commentary today. I assure you we were doing everything we could to get back up to speed - Sahil is a sweaty, frazzled bundle of nerves after that horror start to our comms today. As am I. We both need a nice cup of tea."
559,"Australia face a massive challenge here, on a pitch that is beginning to show signs of sharp turn. Watson was moving very gingerly in the field this morning, and Katich is very obviously in some distress and limping. Will he need a runner? With Clarke's dodgy back and almost the whole seam attack carrying minor niggles, Australia a"
