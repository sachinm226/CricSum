231,"Siddle to Dhoni, no run pushes it towards long-off, no run again"
232,"Siddle to Dhoni, no run gets behind the line and quietly defends it away, now he has to take a single off the last ball"
233,"Siddle to Dhoni, OUT was he a little unlucky there? A big inswinger by Siddle, Dhoni moves across his stumps and attempts to work it to the on side for a single, it appears as if he got an inside edge onto his pads, Siddle is confident and Koertzen raises the finger, that may have missed the legstump as well, I need to see another replay of that"
234,"Nevertheless, Dhoni's knock was welcome and this will prop his Test average. He looked to attack and played his natural game. Siddle has done well for himself on debut picking up 3 for 114. All he needs is more helpful conditions. Do join us shortly for the Australian reply."
235,So India finish with 469. We said earlier that if Dhoni comes good India will get somewhere close to 500. They should be happy with this but may be a trifle disappointed at how the innings ended. At least two out of the last four wickets were giveaways.
