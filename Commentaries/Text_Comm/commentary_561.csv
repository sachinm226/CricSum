0,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 bye oh dear - a big inswinger down the leg side and Haddin palms it to fine-leg"
1,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run on his legs, tries to whip through midwicket but can't get bat on ball - an intrinsic necessity of batting"
2,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run flicked to leg, they steal a single and will have to hurry - throw hits the stumps but Pietersen's quick, limp or no limp, and there's England's 200"
3,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run good, inswinging yorker dug out nicely. Pietersen picks up the ball and throws it back to the bowler - second time he's done that today"
4,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run elegantly driven to mid-off"
5,"Siddle to Pietersen, 2 runs swung into Pietersen's pads who stood tall and commandingly flipped it through midwicket. A wonderful stroke but it's cut off on the boundary"
6,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 run down the leg side and nudged for a single behind square"
7,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, (no ball) well wide of the off stump, and the ninth no-ball of the day"
8,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 1 run outside off, drives cautiously out to deep extra cover"
9,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood goes back, plants his feet and chops out to the off side. Ugly stroke"
10,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run nice shape away from the right-hander"
11,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run blocked solidly off the back foot"
12,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run left alone outside off"

14,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run swings away from Pietersen who shoulders arms"
15,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run bounce for Siddle but wide of the off stump"
16,"Siddle to Pietersen, (no ball) 1 run the inswinger and nicely clipped by Pietersen down to fine leg"
17,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run that's a good line to Collingwood, just outside off and he plays it solidly out to the off side"
18,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs streaky! Not in total control of that, driving it and getting the thickest of edges wide of where a gully might have been placed. Just one slip in place..."
19,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run blocked on the front foot"
20,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run goodish line and length but no swing. Left alone"
21,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run well wide of the off stump, cuts further away and it's ignored"
22,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run again, wide of the off stump. That seems to be the tactic here"
23,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, FOUR runs fantastic shot. Wide of the off stump and somehow Pietersen threads it through extra cover, in spite of the packed off-side field, flinging his hands at it and timing it massively. Top, top shot!"
24,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run ignored outside off"
25,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run inswinging yorker - that's damn close! Quick delivery and the ball balloons to the slips who appeal for both lbw and a catch. That is so, so close! It looked like he got an edge, onto his boot, and the lbw"
26,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run flicked to leg"
27,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run pushed out to the off side"
28,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run short and pulled to deep midwicket"
29,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, 4 leg byes four more - a stray down the leg side. Poor ball, unable to control the inswing"
30,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs ah, poor ball. Really poor delivery, short, wide and cut with power for four"
31,"Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run defended solidly"
32,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run laced it but extra cover fields it smartly"
33,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 3 runs another commanding flick through the leg side. Not quite the Pietersen Flamingo Flick (? Pietersen 2006) but smart nevertheless"
34,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, OUT got him - what a catch by Haddin diving to his right! Just outside the off stump, Collingwood edged it and Haddin moved a little late, but clung on with both hands"
35,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run cuts away from Prior who leaves it alone"
36,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run Prior shuffles across to the off side and defends, solidly"

38,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump"
39,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run a rip-snorting jaffer moving away from Pietersen and beating his drive. Super ball!"
40,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run and this one holds its line, Pietersen again beating playing inside the line. This is great stuff from Siddle"
41,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run defended chippily back to the bowler"
42,"Siddle to Pietersen, no run on the back foot, played back to the bowler"
43,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run sat up nicely and he pulled it massively, but straight to deep square leg"
44,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run flayed and is that dropped? Clarke at short extra cover and he dived forward and to his right...but couldn't cling on. It was a real grass-cutter - only half a chance really"
45,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run cuts away and left alone"
46,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump"
47,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump"
48,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run blocked off the back foot. A touch of movement away from the right hander"
49,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump and left alone"
50,"Siddle to Prior, no run just outside off, Prior guides it out to the off side"
51,"Siddle to Prior, (no ball) superb delivery! Cuts away markedly on the right hander who fishes and misses. Haddin loves it. So does Siddle. So do I. Fine delivery"
52,"Siddle to Prior, 3 runs classily driven off the back foot, though lacking perfect timing"
53,"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run steps outside off and flicks to leg"
54,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs the inswinger and Prior gets bat on it. Well - he gets a lot of bat on it in fact, timed the underwear off it for four. That ball really is booming around"
55,"Siddle to Prior, no run more inswing and well defended on the back foot"
56,"Siddle to Prior, no run outside off and defended on the back foot"
57,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run classical off-drive to mid-off"
58,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 2 runs inside edge past his stumps! He was really late on that and it could've easily knocked out his leg stump"
59,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run driven on the walk to mid-off"
60,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off"
61,"Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run flicked to leg"

65,"Hauritz to Prior, no run comes forward, defending to Katich at short-leg"
66,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run quicker and fuller but Prior's still able to sweep"
67,"Hauritz to Pietersen, OUT got him! A terrible shot from Pietersen, trying to sweep this from miles outside off without getting down into position, and he top edges it meekly straight into the hands of a delighted Katich at short-leg"
68,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run lunges forward and pushes it out to the off side"
69,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run chopped down to the off side"
70,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run powerfully driven to cover - really strong defensive shot"
71,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run late swing! Things are happening for Australia here, but Prior got a thick inside edge"
72,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run defended on the back foot"
73,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run defended again off the back foot, shuffling to the off side"
74,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run very full but a little wide of the off stump"
75,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run Flintoff lunges forward, like an old man leaning on his walking stick. He looks so ill at ease playing spin"
76,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run onto the back foot and flicked to leg"
77,"Hauritz to Prior, 2 runs steps to leg and back-cuts it hard, extravagantly"
78,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run tossed up on middle, elegant flick to leg"
79,"Hauritz to Flintoff, FOUR runs lunges forward and gets an inside edge - for four! Only Flintoff could manage that."
80,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run whipped to mid-on"
81,"Johnson to Prior, no run hooked for four - no! Short midwicket stopped it. That nearly killed him - Prior nailed it"
82,"Johnson to Prior, 1 leg bye turned off his pads"
83,"Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run steps outside leg and flays it out to deep extra cover"
84,"Johnson to Prior, no run on middle, turned to leg"

88,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run on the sweep and powerfully struck"
89,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run turned to leg"
90,"Hauritz to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's a lovely shot from Flintoff. Elegant, even. Poor ball outside off and Flintoff cuts it hard. Way, way too short"
91,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run lunges forward and nudges to leg"
92,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot. My word, he looks so uncomfortable against spin..."
93,"Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs thick outside edge falls short of the slips and goes for four. Not a chance, it was played down and late, but still quite fortuitous"
94,"Johnson to Prior, no run slower delivery, punched to leg"
95,"Johnson to Prior, no run 89.9mph outside off, and it beats Prior's drive"
96,"Johnson to Prior, 1 run guided out to the off side, and guided powerfully too"
97,"Johnson to Flintoff, no run on middle, Flintoff is back and defending with the straightest of bats"
98,"Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs savaged through cover for four. Flintoff at his most caveman-like. Outside off and he plants his feet like an oil rig steadying itself in the north sea, then flays him for four. The ball bounces twice and t"
99,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run Prior gives himself room, defending it with purpose down to long-on"
100,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off"
101,"Hauritz to Flintoff, no run on the back foot, defended"

110,"Katich to Flintoff, no run spins back into Flintoff who defends on the back foot"
111,"Hauritz to Prior, FOUR runs a flat, powerful sweep for four! That was timed with great power. Hughes at deep midwicket couldn't save it - immense muscle in that shot"
112,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run shorter delivery tucked to leg"
113,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run tickled around the corner. Nicely played"
114,"Hauritz to Prior, no run tossed up on middle, Prior's forward, smotheringq"
115,"Hauritz to Prior, 1 run wide of the off stump, Prior gives himself room and pats it wide of point"
116,"Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run fuller, almost a yorker, and it's bunted to Hughes at deep midwicket who receives ironic applause for fielding it cleanly this time"
117,"Katich to Flintoff, FOUR runs back-cuts short of slip - for four! Didn't carry, but well bowled"
118,"Katich to Flintoff, no run ooh quicker - well bowled! Flintoff's on the back foot and defends late"
119,"Katich to Flintoff, no run again on the back foot, he then prods forward"
120,"Katich to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's runs, that is. Tossed up, Flintoff waits for it and heavies it down the ground. Massive power down the ground - nearly cleans Prior up!"
121,"Katich to Flintoff, 1 run short of a length and pulled but mistimed"
122,"Katich to Prior, 1 run beautiful square drive, opening the face"
123,"Johnson to Prior, no run well wide - a wild and woolly delivery that swings late back into the right-hander, but only after pitching"
124,"Johnson to Prior, no run encouraging late swing into Prior - big swing, in fact. Prior defends"
125,"Johnson to Prior, no run a wild, wasted delivery miles wide of the off stump"
126,"Johnson to Prior, no run slashed to point, and only just short of Hussey"
127,"Johnson to Prior, 1 run outside off, defended nicely out to cover for a quick single"
128,"Johnson to Flintoff, no run solidly defended on the front foot"
129,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run late swing forces an error from Prior who tries to drive straight but gets a leading edge out to point"
130,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run a touch of late swing but Flintoff shuffles across to defend"
131,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run forward onto the front foot, takes a thick outside edge which falls short of second slip. Soft hands - well, soft for Flintoff anyway"
132,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 2 runs shorter ball and pulled to leg"
133,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run comes forward to defend on the front foot"
134,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's runs that is. Massive runs. Flintoff's most authoritative stroke today is pulled through midwicket with commanding power. Bosh!"
135,"Johnson to Prior, 3 runs gorgeous extra-cover drive - and they'll get overthrows too. Ponting distinctly, emphatically unimpressed by the backing up. The double teapot isn't yet out, but give it time...the crowd are just beginning to win"
136,"Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run onto the front foot and defended out to the off side - excellent running and they get a single. Flintoff's beginning to run Australia a little ragged here. It's an adventurous, cheeky innings"
137,"Johnson to Prior, 2 runs flicked to leg and placed for two"
138,"Johnson to Prior, 3 runs short of a length and pulled wide of mid-on, but not quite timed it as well as he might. Still - more aggressive intent shown by this pair, and the new-ball is flying all over the shop"
139,"Johnson to Flintoff, no run just outside the off stump and he laces it - absolutely murders it! - but straight to long-off"
140,"Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run nudged to leg and Flintoff retains the strike with a nudge to leg"
141,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run a wild swing and a miss to an excellent, if slightly wide, outswinger"
142,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run another very good outswinger is left alone"
143,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 1 leg bye down the leg side and it doesn't straighten as much as he'd like. Turned for a single"
144,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs gorgeous extra cover drive, though it'll be cut off by the man on the boundary"
145,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run nudged to leg for another single"
146,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run defended solidly to point"
147,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs don't bowl there to Prior. Back cut for four - super, controlled, elegant shot. He's so strong outside the off stump: as good as anyone"
148,"Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs exceptional, thrashing cover-drive for four! One of the shots of the day, opening the face and absolutely smiting it for four. Not a great delivery"
149,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run cuts it off the back foot, one hand coming off the bat"
150,"Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run a forcing, back-foot drive for a single"
151,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run cuts it out to the off side for his ninth Test fifty, and what an attractive knock that's been. Timely for England, too - and from 54 balls. Impressive"
152,"Siddle to Flintoff, no run Flintoff shoulders arms with extravagance outside off"
153,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs four more - but not convincingly. Thick outside edge flies past the slips down to third man. Everything's going England's way at the moment"
154,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run blocked out to the off side for a quick single"
155,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run he's laced that, standing tall and driving it with ugly brute force, but mid-off does brilliantly, diving to his right to field"
156,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run very late on this good, straight delivery and nearly gets a thin inside edge"
157,"Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 1 run guides this out to the off side and Prior calls him through for a single - they'll have to be quick! Hilfenhaus screws up the fielding, however, and they're home"
158,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run well bowled! A superb comeback! Outswinger beating the drive"
159,"Siddle to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot, the ball balloons out to the off side and Flintoff hasn't a clue where it's gone"
160,"Siddle to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot out to the off side. No chance of a single, though they think of it"
161,"Siddle to Flintoff, no run onto the front foot, defending solidly"
162,"Siddle to Flintoff, OUT bowled him! An horrid, angled bat as he tries to drive but gets a thick inside edge which hammers into his stumps"
163,"Siddle to Anderson, no run shuffles back, defends just short of short-leg"
164,"Siddle to Anderson, no run wide of the off stump and left alone"
165,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run brute of a delivery - a stunner! Late outswing away from Prior's drive"
166,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run more swing, but guided out to the off side for a single"
167,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run big, booming inswing into Anderson, the left-hander"
168,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run shuffles back and nervously turns it to leg"
169,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run great delivery that cuts away at the last moment - that's brilliant from Hilfenhaus! Anderson, well, he hasn't a clue how to play that"
170,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 wide wide - way, way too wide and it's eventually signalled as such by the umpire"
171,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run left alone outside off"
172,"Siddle to Prior, no run comes forward, tries to defend but is beaten by outswing. Unlucky again for poor old Siddle"
173,"Siddle to Prior, no run smartly blocked off the back foot"
174,"Siddle to Prior, OUT inswing back into the right-hander and he's bowled him! A fantastic delivery by Siddle - huge, late inswing and it forces its way through Prior's gate"
175,"Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs beautifully played. On the front foot, opens the face and defends it with an open face down to third man"
176,"Siddle to Broad, no run shorter delivery, Broad's back and defending off the back foot"
177,"Siddle to Broad, 1 wide wide again - well wide of the off stump. Ponting doesn't like it"
178,"Siddle to Broad, no run defended to backward point"
179,"Johnson to Anderson, no run Anderson cracks him powerfully off the back foot"
180,"Johnson to Anderson, no run Anderson steps to leg before guiding this off the back foot. Safely, comfortably played"
181,"Johnson to Anderson, 2 runs flayed out to the off side - timed that quite nicely, too. They only take two though"
182,"Johnson to Anderson, no run good, tight line on the off stump which is defended on the back foot out to cover"
183,"Johnson to Anderson, no run stroked confidently - elegantly, even - out to mid-off"

185,"Siddle to Broad, no run Broad shuffles back to defend with a straight bat off the back foot"
186,"Siddle to Broad, no run good line and length on off stump, Broad goes back to defend solidly on the back foot"
187,"Siddle to Broad, no run touch too wide - a nice early-morning sighter for Broad"
188,"Siddle to Broad, no run on the back foot, he's defending crisply off the back foot"
189,"Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs my word. That's a beautiful shot - the most orthodox and creamy cover drive rockets across the turf for four. Superb shot"
190,"Siddle to Broad, no run better line and defended on the back foot"
191,"Johnson to Anderson, 3 runs have some of that! That's the way tailenders should play. Short, wide and he clatters it over point. It's slightly mistimed, but an encouraging sign of intent"
192,"Johnson to Broad, no run that's a snorter from Johnson - a real jagging, cutting, viper of a delivery that shot back off the seam and cut Broad in half"
193,"Johnson to Broad, no run defended on the back foot"
194,"Johnson to Broad, 2 runs that's well played, forcing this good length delivery off the back foot"
195,"Johnson to Broad, 1 run inside edge! That could've gone anywhere and very nearly destroyed Broad's stumps"
196,"Johnson to Anderson, no run steps to leg and tries to clout him through extra cover but mistiming it"
197,"Siddle to Broad, no run plays and misses outside off - very fine delivery, holding its line"
198,"Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs thick outside edge, but played with soft hands and he'll get four for that. Not totally in control of that..."
199,"Siddle to Broad, no run better. Onto the front foot and he defends"
200,"Siddle to Broad, no run shuffles back and leaves it outside off"
201,"Siddle to Broad, no run firmly blocked off the back foot"
202,"Johnson to Anderson, no run short of a length, Anderson rocks back and gives himself room while defending chippily out to the off side"
203,"Johnson to Anderson, no run good take - great snaffle by Haddin to a horrible stray from Johnson down the leg side"
204,"Johnson to Anderson, no run another loose one down the leg side at 92mph"
205,"Johnson to Anderson, 1 run nicely played, shuffling back and timing it past cover for a single"
206,"Johnson to Broad, OUT bowled him! Johnson gets one on target at last and bowls Broad off his pads and around his legs"
207,"Johnson to Swann, no run on leg stump and defended"
208,"Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs thick outside edge flies down to third man for four! Only two slips in place and it flies past them for four"
209,"Siddle to Anderson, 3 runs shot from Anderson, flicking his wrists like Azharuddin (? Gnasher) through midwicket. Excellent running yields three"
210,"Siddle to Swann, no run better line and length, defended on the front foot"
211,"Siddle to Swann, no run very good line. Siddle's struggled against the left-handers this morning and looks more comfortable against Swann, who plays and misses to one that shoots a bit low. Very low, in fact"
212,"Siddle to Swann, no run that's a good nut too, cutting back sharply into Swann's pads"
213,"Siddle to Swann, 1 run attempts a booming cover drive but gets a thick inside edge. They scamper a single as though their lives depend on it. And in some ways, that's true"
214,"Johnson to Swann, no run nudged off his pads"
215,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs well played. Opened the face and played it carefully, watchfully past the slips for four. No third man..."
216,"Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs driven on the up for four! Take that! Johnson's not happy, winging down some verbal half-volleys which are probably wasted on Swann, who plays his cricket as though each match is his last. Cracking shot"
217,"Johnson to Swann, no run better ball on middle stump, shaping back, and it's defended"
218,"Johnson to Swann, 3 runs a short-arm pick-up over midwicket - England are flying here. 91mph on his legs and picked up cheekily"
219,"Johnson to Anderson, 2 leg byes ooh, that hurries him off the pads. But it flies through the slips! Johnson's close to blowing a gasket here, and the crowd are riling him and his team"
220,"Siddle to Swann, 3 runs classily driven for three. He's really timed that well, too! It's poor bowling again from Siddle, though - a floaty half-volley, and Swann is no mug with the bat"
221,"Siddle to Anderson, no run ooh edged, and just short of third slip. Better length from Siddle"
222,"Siddle to Anderson, no run excellent delivery, spitting up at Anderson who jumps back and defends on the tips of his toes"
223,"Siddle to Anderson, 3 runs another fine shot. Another poor delivery. Outside off, Anderson flays his hands at it and scorches it through cover"
224,"Siddle to Swann, 2 runs outside off, Swann briefly thinks he's Viv Richards and pulls it through midwicket, but mistimes it. Nevertheless, England are absolutely on a roll here. It's one-day cricket"
225,"Siddle to Swann, no run cracked to point"
226,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run starts with a full delivery that's dug out"
227,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run smart cricket by Anderson, flicking it behind square for a single"
228,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run cut out to the off side"
229,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run on the front foot, driving, and opening the face behind square"
230,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run big shout - that's dead close as it moves back at the last moment but the umpire says no. How is that not-out? Pitched in line and looked like it was taking out middle-and-off"
231,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run beaten by a brute which lifts and leaves him at the last moment"
232,"Hauritz to Swann, 4 byes huge turn, but down the leg side. Monty, are you watching? Swann has a wry grin as this one turns off middle stump and Haddin hasn't a chance"
233,"Hauritz to Swann, no run more massive spin - off the good part of the pitch, too, not the rough"
234,"Hauritz to Swann, no run tosses it up on middle-and-off and it spins into his pads"
235,"Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs down the pitch and Swann clouts him over mid-on for four. The fielder gives chase but drags it over the line - excellent, aggressive cricket"
236,"Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs lifts this down the ground but mid-on will pick it up. Er, or not! Siddle's not picked it up and it goes for four - he only had two metres to move. The wheels are rapidly falling off"
237,"Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs reverse-swept for four more! Brilliant from Swann, and Australia are beginning to lose the plot. That's England's 400 up too"
238,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run on the back foot, pushed out to cover"
239,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run"
240,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run powerfully forced off the back foot"
241,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run swings back late into his pads"
242,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run too straight and worked for a single to leg"
243,"Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run defended to cover"
244,"Hauritz to Anderson, 1 run skips down the pitch, tries to smack him over the top but gets a thick outside edge...which falls short of point. Australia can't catch a break this morning"
245,"Hauritz to Swann, 1 run swept ungainly - flicking it, not unlike Pietersen's horror-shot yesterday"
246,"Hauritz to Anderson, no run tries to smack him over midwicket but beaten by prodigious turn. Good stuff by Hauritz, giving the ball some air"
247,"Hauritz to Anderson, OUT down the pitch and he tries to lift him over mid-on but he can't - an easy catch for Hussey who jumps back and swallows it"
248,"Hauritz to Swann, no run"
249,"Hauritz to Swann, no run that is a magnificently odd shot from Swann, who switches around to become a left-hander and tries for a slog but misses"
250,"Hilfenhaus to Panesar, 3 runs a huge roar as Panesar clips one away off his pads and nearly gets a boundary but it's chased down just in time"
251,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, 2 runs and Swann lofts cleanly over mid-on, comes back for an easy two and keeps the strike"
252,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run backs away and advances, swinging at one outside off stump and misses the lot"
