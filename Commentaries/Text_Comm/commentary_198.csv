232,"Hazlewood to Samuels, 1 run there it is! There is Samue's moment. He has played 16 years against Australia, and this is his first century against them. The crowd bursts into cheers. This has been some knock. He kisses the helmet and gets a hug from KP. Full and straight, he goes deep in the crease"
233,"Hazlewood to Pollard, SIX runs caught at the edge of the boundary Maxwell signals a six. Back of a length and angled in, Pollard clouts it in the air. Shovelled it, in fact. Maxwell pouched it, but lost momentum as his left foot touched the rope at the deep midwicket boundary"

246,"Faulkner to Samuels, OUT No, he is dismissed off the last ball of WI's innings. What a reception for him! Full and outside off, Samuels swings and ends up slicing a catch to sweeper cover"

283,"Gabriel to Bailey, no run straightens off length on middle, Bailey hops back and defends"

285,"Gabriel to Bailey, no run pushed off the backfoot to cover point"
286,"Gabriel to Bailey, FOUR runs the edge flies into the third man boundary. Lucky, but it doesn't matter for Australia. Looks to slash, went hard at it and got the result he desired in the end"

302,"Brathwaite to Smith, FOUR runs imperious pull! Picks the length early, rolls his wrists to keep the ball down and picks the gap at square leg. Easy pickings"
