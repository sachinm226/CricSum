46,"Hafeez to Watson, 1 run nicely bowled, Watson can't get much of it and it runs away for a single"
47,"Hafeez to Clarke, OUT gone! Real bonus for Hafeez and Pakistan! Quicker ball, Clarke gave himself room to try and cut it away, but it zipped through and castled middle stump"
48,"Hafeez to Hussey, no run good first ball to David Hussey, the new man, full and straight and driven calmly back to the bowler"
49,"Afridi to Watson, 1 run Afridi continues to cause trouble, this is fuller and a touch slower outside off stump, Watson edges his drive though to point and some sharp running allows a single"
50,"Afridi to Hussey, no run zippy delivery, Hussey trying to cut it away but has neither the time nor space for the shot"
51,"Afridi to Hussey, no run good ball again, full and Hussey drives carefully into the off side without any power"
52,"Afridi to Hussey, 1 run gets a run this time, threading it through the off side for a single"

107,"Sami to White, 2 runs good yorker here, where was this last over? White still squeezes it away and some swift running allows him to collect two"

111,"Ajmal to White, 2 runs excellent bowling let down but sloppy fielding from Salman Butt, White got well across to the off side, tried to sweep it away, couldn't time it but Butt lets it through him a short fine leg"
112,"Ajmal to White, OUT nicely done from Saeed Ajmal, holding it back, White tried to get it away but could only heave it to the square leg boundary where Fawad Alam takes the catch"
113,"Ajmal to Hussey, 1 run fired in at Hussey, not giving him any room, Hussey tries to sweep it away but can't quite get the vicious power needed so it goes for a single down to square leg"
114,"Ajmal to Haddin, 1 run another single, good bowling this, he really should have opened the bowling, Haddin whipping a fullish ball into the midwicket region"

117,"Amir to Haddin, OUT gone! No mistake from Sami at short third man, it was full and outside off, Haddin throws his hands at it, gets an edge and neatly taken. Dot ball is what matters at this stage, but the total is already imposing"
118,"Amir to Johnson, OUT Aamer strikes! Lovely yorker and Johnson can't get his bat down in time, it crashes into middle stump, lovely bowling"
119,"Amir to Smith, OUT well it's three wickets in three balls, but not a hat-trick! Another good yorker, Smith swished and misses, they attempt to run a bye to get Hussey on strike, Kamran is quick with the throw and Hussey is run out"
120,"Amir to Nannes, OUT well, what have we here!? Is it four in four!? Another yorker, another swish, another attempted bye, and yes, another run out. Good stuff from Pakistan in this final over, a touch farcical out there, it must be said."
121,"Amir to Tait, no run ooh, this time they reject the bye, Tait plays and misses haplessly at a good ball outside off, but stands his ground imperiously"
122,"Amir to Tait, OUT gone this time! Bowled him! How utterly extraordinary and bizarre. Decent length and line, Tait gives himself room and it cannons off his pads on to off stump. So we have a five-wicket maiden, yet Australia are completely on top."
123,"Australia have had a torrid outing at the last two World Twenty20 tournaments but have made a very strong opening statement here. Now they unleash their battery of pace bowlers, how will Pakistan respond?"
124,"I can't get over how odd that final over was, excellent bowling suicidal running. But when you lose five wickets in an over it should spell disaster, but in this case it barely matters at all. It will make a good quiz question at some point I'm sure."
125,"What an amusing end to a very destructive Australia innings. Before those five wickets in six balls Australia ran rampant, first Watson and then David Hussey powering the ball around mercilessly. It would take something quite special for Pakistan to climb this mountain."
126,"So here is Salman Butt and Kamran Akmal and they have a big task on their hands. Nannes will open up, slip in place."
127,"Nannes to Kamran, 1 wide starts with a wide, swinging down the leg side, Akmal misses his leg-side flick and Pakistan are off"
128,"Nannes to Kamran, OUT well, you get a sense this could fizzle out too quickly, Pakistan need almost 10 an over, this is full outside off, Akmal clears his front leg and slices it away off the outside edge down to Steve Smith on the third man boundary, who snaffles it easily enough"
129,"Nannes to Hafeez, FOUR runs what a lovely shot, all timing and placement, no brutality at all, full and outside off and Hafeez pushed it through the covers for four"
130,"Nannes to Hafeez, no run a touch shorter this time, Hafeez rocking back and trying to pull it away, gets it high on the bat and it trickles to midwicket"
131,"Nannes to Hafeez, no run on off stump this time, Hafeez is back and across and defending into the off side, good bowling from Nannes"
132,"Nannes to Hafeez, no run tight line again, hovering around middle and off on a good length, Hafeez attempting to flick this into the leg side, can't get it away"
133,"Nannes to Hafeez, FOUR runs touch to short and Hafeez takes advantage, flicking wristily backward of square on the leg side for four"
134,"Tait to Salman Butt, 1 wide Tait is into the action and launches a sharp, vicious bouncer that whizzes past Butt's ear, sadly a wide in this format"
135,"Tait to Salman Butt, no run much fuller this time, on off stump, Butt gets forward and pushes hurriedly into the off side"
136,"Tait to Salman Butt, 2 runs full again, this time on leg stump, Butt flicks it though midwicket, not quite timing it perfectly, and collects a couple"
137,"Tait to Salman Butt, 1 run good from Tait, tight line and good length, Butt pushes it away to a deep-set mid on fielder for one"
138,"Tait to Hafeez, no run strange shot this from Hafeez, attempting a drive on the up from this back of a length delivery outside off stump, can only find fresh air"
139,"Tait to Hafeez, no run touch shorter this, and Hafeez just flinches at it outside off, nothing shot, and it zips through to Haddin"
140,"Tait to Hafeez, 1 wide oops, slower ball that slips out of Tait's hands at beamer height, but it is harmless and down the leg side"
141,"Tait to Hafeez, no run back on a length and line this time, and a whole lot quicker, Hafeez jumps back and defends in a hurry, top bowling"
142,"Nannes to Salman Butt, no run Nannes finds a tidy line on off stump, just back of a length, Butt tries to force it into the leg side but gets nothing on it"
143,"Nannes to Salman Butt, FOUR runs well the shot was born of desperation, but executed very well, Butt skips leg side to give himself room and thrashes it through point for four"
144,"Nannes to Salman Butt, no run nothing on this one, back on to a good line and length, Butt in his crease and defending"
145,"Nannes to Salman Butt, FOUR runs this is an excellent shot, all wrists and placement, fullish on off stump and flashed in front of point for four"
146,"Nannes to Salman Butt, FOUR runs and again! lovely shot, gets inside the line and flashes his wrists at a full ball, square through the off side for another boundary"
147,"Nannes to Salman Butt, 2 wide looks like Butt may have briefly rattled Nannes here, who shoves this well down the leg side for a wide, Haddin can't collect so they run an extra"
148,"Nannes to Hafeez, no run good ball to finish a damaging over, Hafeez works it from middle to midwicket"
149,"Tait to Salman Butt, no run all action here, Butt wondering leg side to give himself room, Tait follows him and bangs it in short, Butt attempts a half-blinded pull shot and misses"
150,"Tait to Salman Butt, OUT Tait strikes this time! Similar to the last ball, Butt trying to give himself room, Tait follows him with a bouncer, the attempted pull this time gets high on the bat and loops gently to Hussey at mid on, Pakistan in real trouble"
151,"Tait to Hafeez, no run this time it's outside off stump, worked calmly into the off side for no run"
152,"Tait to Hafeez, 1 wide full and outside off, Hafeez swishes, misses and the umpire decides it's a fraction too far outside off and calls wide"
153,"Tait to Hafeez, no run back on to a tight line, Hafeez in very orthodox position just stroking it gently into the covers"
154,"Tait to Hafeez, no run nothing on offer here, Tait has really found his range, good length, good line, Hafeez defends"
155,"Tait to Hafeez, FOUR runs suddenly a big shot attempted from Hafeez, bunts this from outside off stump over mid on for a boundary, not timed perfectly but much-needed runs"
156,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run Mitchell Johnson is the new man, and he's pretty swift too, arrowed in on to middle and worked away for a single"
157,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run good ball this, outside off and Umar opens the face, guiding it away for a bristling single down to third man"
158,"Johnson to Misbah, 1 wide bonus run here for Pakistan, and they will need plenty more, shoved down the leg side"
159,"Johnson to Misbah, 1 run shortish and very casually worked away down to fine leg for a single by Misbah"
160,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run another good ball from Johnson, finds a good line and length, Umar content to push it into the off side"
161,"Johnson to Misbah, no run tidy end to a tidy over, pushed away towards point from a back-of-a-length delivery"

165,"Watson to Umar Akmal, 1 run this time it's just a single, worked away into space"
166,"Watson to Misbah, no run not much Misbah can do here, defending into the off side"
167,"Watson to Misbah, 2 runs nicely done here from Misbah, just turning his wrists over the ball, and working it down to fine leg for a couple"
168,"Hussey to Umar Akmal, no run David Hussey into the attack and Umar attempts a lashing cut, but misses it entirely"
169,"Hussey to Umar Akmal, 2 runs gets more bat on this, and it goes to the point fielder"

171,"Hussey to Umar Akmal, 1 run more careful here, and pushed away for a single"
172,"Hussey to Misbah, no run oh dear, that's a horrible looking shot, down on one knee and attempting to reverse-poke this misses and no run"
173,"Hussey to Misbah, 1 run this time he stands up and pushes it down the ground for a single"
174,"Clarke to Misbah, no run Michael Clarke slings this into around the off stump, attempted cut shot, trickles out to the point fielder"
