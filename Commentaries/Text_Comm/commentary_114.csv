266,"Willey to Neser, OUT edged, gone, and it's three in the over! Who says Willey isn't a death bowler? Neser makes room outside leg, feathers his off-side slap and Australia are subsiding rapidly"
267,"Willey to Jhye Richardson, no run yorker, well dug out. That was a lively over"
268,"Wood to Paine, 1 run attempted yorker, tailing into the pads, chiselled round the corner to bring up the 300"
269,"Wood to Jhye Richardson, no run an under-edged smear, Buttler does well to drop a glove on it"
270,"Wood to Jhye Richardson, 1 run attacking the stumps on a full length, clipped hard to long-on"

274,"Wood to Jhye Richardson, 1 run rolls the fingers on another attempted yorker, chopped out to backward point"
275,"Willey to Jhye Richardson, 1 run smeared along the ground to long-on, lining up the outswing and connecting well enough"
276,"Willey to Paine, OUT round the wicket, angled into the pads, and Willey strikes again! Another slog across the line, but was he struck outside the line? Paine can't be bothered to review... but that was umpire's call ... very marginal!"
277,"Willey to Lyon, 2 runs slammed high in the air, who wants this? Willey wants this! He sprints out to midwicket, but can't quite reach it to complete his five-for"
278,"Willey to Lyon, no run length ball, fizzes through a wild swing"
279,"Willey to Lyon, 1 run cracked airily out to cover, where Morgan pounces with one hand, which briefly discombobulates Richardson. But he gets back safely"
280,"Willey to Jhye Richardson, 2 runs thumped to cover, and that's the end of Australia's spirited innings"
281,A very England-at-the-2015-World-Cup total. How did that pan out? Oh ...
282,"5.10pm So, Australia amass 310 for 8, which might have been a big total ten years ago, but right at this moment of time, it feels a touch underwhelming. But credit where it is due to Australia. Two centuries have given them a fighting chance, and an ODI ground record too. Back in"
283,"Hello again. We'll be cracking on with the run chase at CLS soon enough... This is the approach I expect England to take. Once upon a time, 300 was pretty much the final frontier for chasing - England managed it twice between 1971 and 2014 - but times have changed. Won't be long"
284,"Here come Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, not exactly fresh off the back of 481 - having spent a few sweaty hours in the field - but raring to go, I'm sure. Michael Neser will open the bowling"
285,"Neser to Roy, FOUR runs short and on the hip, Roy clips it firmly away, past the dive of short fine leg for four off the first ball! Well, I suppose Finch did the same"
286,"Neser to Roy, no run pitched up on off, diligent lines and Roy defends this time"
287,"Neser to Roy, no run touch shorter, forced down into the ground and towards mid-off"
288,"Neser to Roy, no run comes across, Roy gets a little tangled up trying to whip the ball to leg"
289,"Neser to Roy, 1 run length in the channel, thick-edged down to third man"

293,"Stanlake to Roy, 2 runs short and rising, Roy rolls the wrists and sends the ball in front of deep square leg, they come racing back for two"
294,"Stanlake to Roy, FOUR runs larruped through extra cover! What a shot that is, not overly full but the bounce is true and Roy steps out to ping it through the infield, rebounding off the middle of the bat with interest"
295,"Stanlake to Roy, no run good length on off, defended this time"
296,"Stanlake to Roy, FOUR runs touch too full, that's stroked for four more! Leans into the shot, all timing back down the ground... England into their stride"

298,"Neser to Bairstow, FOUR runs pitched up and smashed through the covers again, YJB eases the boundary count on by one"
299,"Neser to Bairstow, no run comes across and pushes a length ball into the off side"
300,"Neser to Bairstow, no run slams into the back leg, Neser goes up... but Michael Gough shakes his head! Maybe nipping down the leg side? Ah, perhaps some inside edge on it, too"
301,"Neser to Bairstow, no run turned into the midwicket area"
302,"Neser to Bairstow, no run full outside off, YJB throws the hands but doesn't connect cleanly and the ball dribbles to cover"
303,"Stanlake to Roy, SIX runs banged in, too quick for Roy on the pull... but nevermind, his top-edge flies all the way over fine leg for six! Safe option, with no one outside the ring down there"
304,"Stanlake to Roy, no run dug in back of a length, Roy rides the bounce"
305,"Stanlake to Roy, no run straighter line, Roy blocks it back down the track"
306,"Stanlake to Roy, no run touch short, angling in with the arm, tucked defensively into the leg side"
307,"Stanlake to Roy, FOUR runs too full, that's in the slot again and Roy skewers it through the covers for another boundary. Ho hum"
308,"Stanlake to Roy, FOUR runs back of a length, rising up towards the hip, Ropy only needs to tuck it away on the pull and it races to fine leg for four more!"
309,"Neser to Bairstow, 1 run pitched up and driven through cover, there's a sweeper out there now"
310,"Neser to Roy, no run fullish, on the stumps and worked towards mid-on"
311,"Neser to Roy, no run full in the channel, this keeps a touch low as Roy swings for the hills and fails to connect"
312,"Neser to Roy, no run short but taking the pace off, Roy is through his pull shot early and gets a bottom edge wide of the Paine, who gets across"
313,"Neser to Roy, 2 runs too straight, this is flicked off the legs wide of short fine and Stanlake has to lumber into gear to prevent a boundary"
314,"Neser to Roy, no run fourth-stump line, driven on the up to extra cover"
315,"Lyon to Bairstow, FOUR runs pushed through, bit of turn but the ball sits up nicely on off stump and Bairstow carves it through point for four"
316,"Lyon to Bairstow, no run tossed up, tapped down into the covers"
317,"Lyon to Bairstow, 3 runs slightly short and steered through backward point, lovely placement but it's just about reeled in in front of the rope"
318,"Lyon to Roy, no run pushed through quicker, bit of overspin as Roy waits in the crease and tucks to midwicket"
319,"Lyon to Roy, no run floated up, punched to cover coming across"
320,"Lyon to Roy, 1 run flighted, spinning in and worked towards mid-on, it's a tight single but Roy calls it and looks to be home... although the throw is wayward"
321,"Neser to Roy, 1 run back of a length, rasped into the off side and they pinch one with the fielder back"
322,"Neser to Bairstow, FOUR runs on the pads, that's a poor ball with no protection and Bairstow just calmly fiddles it away to the fine leg boundary - that's the England 50 up, lickety-split"
323,"Neser to Bairstow, 1 run fullish, middle and leg stump, clipped through midwicket"
324,"Neser to Roy, FOUR runs on the legs again, Roy doesn't have to exert himself in glancing four more through backward square"

339,"Agar to Roy, no run pushed through, beats the outside edge and Paine whips off the bails... they are going to check upstairs, Roy did shift his back foot fractionally but I don't think it was in the air at the time. No, Dharmasena's happy he was in"
340,"Agar to Roy, 1 run tossed up and pushed back down the ground - half-century for Roy, continuing his purple form"
341,"Agar to Bairstow, no run flat on off stump, YJB chops into the off side"
