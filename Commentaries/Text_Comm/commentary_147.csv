1,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run punched straight to cover point"
2,"Cummins to Babar Azam, 3 runs quality stroke from a quality player. Punching through the line between cover and point. Warner sprints behind that and pulls it back in"
3,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 wide way over the batsman's head, too short from Cummins outside off. This time it's called wide. Wade was airborne when he collected that"
4,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run solidly behind the line of that full delivery on middle, eased back down to the bowler"
5,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run gets half forward and punches the away-going length delivery to cover"
6,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 wide too short, another wide. Looking to test the bounce of the surface, is he? This was way down leg side and the correct call"
7,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 run stands tall and punches it past the diving point fielder for an easy single"
8,"Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 run swivels back and pulls him to deep fine leg. Cummins misfields but recovers quickly to keep it to a single"
9,"Stanlake to Babar Azam, no run not there for the cut. Too full, not much width as well, the ball shaves past the inside edge"
10,"Stanlake to Babar Azam, 1 run looks to force one through cover, gets an inside edge that rolls past leg stump, Wade does well to run to his left and stop that. No feet movement there from Azam"
11,"Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run didn't get underneath the delivery, looked to slap that down the ground past mid-off"
12,"Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run slower delivery, was through with the flick, except this time there was more bounce and was hit on the thigh pad as a result"
13,"Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run stays inside the crease and dabs the away-going length ball to the off side. Excellent comeback this from Stanlake"
14,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run bangs a short ball outside off, Azam gets on top of the bounce and fends it to the off side"
15,"Cummins to Babar Azam, 1 run driven through the line to Warner at mid-off, chances his arm and takes off for a single, the throw is fired to the striker's end. Sharjeel was well in"
16,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run ripper of a delivery that nips away late to beat Sharjeel's flirty push. Played inside the line of that delivery"
17,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 run stands tall and punches the short of length delivery to cover"
18,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run good bouncer on middle and off, Azam gets out of the way nice and early"
19,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run bullet drive, but the bowler does well to put his right hand out on the follow-through and stop that"
20,"Head to Sharjeel, no run drifts one into middle, Sharjeel gets forward and blocks"
21,"Head to Sharjeel, FOUR runs that's the release he has been waiting for. Head errs in length, this one's too short, Sharjeel makes room and cracks it behind point. Poor effort from Cummins. First boundary since the fifth over"
22,"Head to Sharjeel, no run cramped for room, hit back to the bowler this time"
23,"Head to Sharjeel, no run gets forward and dabs the in-drifter back down the pitch"
24,"Head to Sharjeel, no run big, big shout for lbw. Sharjeel looks to get outside the line of the stumps and mow it over square leg, looks like he got a hint of bat on that. Australia have no reviews left. Close call though"
25,"Head to Sharjeel, no run leans forward and turns the full delivery to midwicket"
26,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run mix-up, but sent back. Azam pushed this towards mid-on and was wandering down the pitch. There was a direct hit at the striker's end but he was just in"
27,"Cummins to Babar Azam, FOUR runs lucky break. Frustration for the bowler. No feet movement from Azam as he looks to thrash this over point, gets a thick inside edge to the fine leg boundary instead"
28,"Cummins to Babar Azam, 1 run gets on top of the bounce and works this to square leg"
29,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 run better technique, gets onto his toes and fends this to the leg side as they scamper a run"

33,"Head to Sharjeel, no run pushed through quicker on middle, dabbed to the off side"
34,"Head to Sharjeel, FOUR runs width and he's crashed that into the deep point boundary. Warner it is again. Super effort to get there, sprinted 30 metres and then got in the dive, but couldn't stop it as the ball clipped him on the chest and deflected to the boundary"
35,"Head to Sharjeel, FOUR runs pulled wide of midwicket. That is a bullet hit, long-on was no more than a few yards from the delivery but he had no chance. Sharjeel on the move"
36,"Head to Sharjeel, FOUR runs thick edge that races past short third man. There's a half-century for Sharjeel. The fans are happy. He looked to crack this behind point"
37,"Head to Sharjeel, OUT the party is over! Sharjeel looks to cut again, this time it was too close for him to play that. The drift in ensured he only managed a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. Celebration one delivery, frustration the next."
38,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run back of a length in the corridor, climbs up on top of the bounce and bunts it back to the bowler"
39,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run good length outside off, puts a stride in and pushes it to covers"
40,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run full length, angling in towards off, times the drive nicely but straight to mid-on"

42,"Cummins to Babar Azam, 2 runs full and angled in on off stump, puts in a half-stride, gets a high elbow in and drives it past Warner at mid-off. Should've been three"

44,"Head to Shafiq, no run around the wicket, good length, angled across, forward defence"
45,"Head to Shafiq, 1 run drops it short and wide, cut away to sweeper cover"
46,"Head to Babar Azam, no run Uff! Angled across from middle stump and holds it's line. Outside edge falls safe"

48,"Head to Babar Azam, 1 run good length on middle stump, goes back and glances it to the right of midwicket"

50,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run back of a length, angled across the left-hander, pulled away without any timing, goes to the right of mid-on"
51,"Faulkner to Shafiq, 1 run back of a length, slightly outside off, too close to cut but he goes for it anyway and hits it uppishly to third man"
52,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run SHOT. Full outside off, gets behind the line and drives it down beautfiully. Deserved four there, bu mid-off puts in a good dive"
53,"Faulkner to Shafiq, 1 run good length, angled across off stump, pushed through the open covers region"
54,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run good length outside off, waits on it and opens the face to run it down to third man"

59,"Head to Babar Azam, 1 run dropped short, pulled away to deep midiwcket"
60,"Head to Shafiq, no run full outside off, hard hands, doesn't connect the cover drive well"
61,"Head to Shafiq, OUT GONE! Grade cricket batting that. Head loops it across him outside off, he steps out early, gets beaten in flight and doesn't know what to do with it next. Flails at it as it keeps drifting away and he can only get a top-edge, straight to short third man"
62,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run Did that carry? It did and he's dropped it in his follow through. Good length on middle, pushes at it well away from his body and chips it back to Faulkner, who has to dive low to get to it. He doesn't. Instead, it clips his fingers and hits the stumps at the non-strikers, where Malik is just a"

66,"Faulkner to Malik, no run good length, angled across the batsman, left alone"
67,"Faulkner to Malik, FOUR runs good length, angled across, no feet movement again as he throws his hands at this. Gets an inside edge and the fine leg fielder's dive only gives the ball momentum to hit the rope"

76,"Faulkner to Malik, no run back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
77,"Faulkner to Malik, 6 runs good length on off stump, goes forward and pushes it nicely behind point. Wade has an unnecessary shy at the non-strikers where Fualkner isn't expecting it and gives away four extra runs"
78,"Faulkner to Malik, no run good length, off stump, front foot defence"
79,"Faulkner to Malik, no run back of a length on off stump, defended"
80,"Head to Babar Azam, no run floated on middle, steps out but can push it only to midwicket"
81,"Head to Babar Azam, 1 run dropped short, driven off the back foot to long-on"
82,"Head to Malik, SIX runs WOW! You can keep looking at that on loop. Floated on off stump, he steps out and lifts it majestically over the bowler's head and whacks the sightscreen - which is a 103 metres behind. Gorgeous."

86,"Hazlewood to Malik, no run good length on off stump, nips back in slightly, defended off the back foot"

101,"Hazlewood to Malik, 1 run short and wide, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
102,"Hazlewood to Babar Azam, 1 run good length, tails in again, and gets the inside half of his bat. To the right of mid-on. This movement is encouraging."
103,"Hazlewood to Malik, no run bouncer on off stump, Malik is happy to duck under this"
104,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run short outside off, not wide enough for the cut, and he gets it on the inside half and into the pitch"
105,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 2 leg byes CLOSE! Almost picked up my first commentary wicket. Walks across his stumps to this good length delivery, and catches it on his pads as he tries to flick it. Pitched outside leg though but trapped him right in front"
106,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 wide short and too wide"
107,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run walks across again, but this time gets bat on it and turns it down to fine leg"
108,"Faulkner to Malik, no run good length on off stump, small stride, defended"
109,"Faulkner to Malik, no run full and wide outside off, he wants to push this to sweeper for a single, but not feet. Thick inside edge back to the bowler"

115,"Stanlake to Malik, no run 139 kph, full and angling in on middle stump, driven nicely to mid-on"
116,"Stanlake to Malik, FOUR runs EDGED! Strange shot that. Full outside off, no feet, tries to half-caress, half-drive that through the off side, but gets a big outside edge down to the third man boundary"
117,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run AND THERE IT IS! Full outside off, drives it to mid-off and runs across. He's equalled Richards, Pietersen, Trott and de Kock as the fastest to 1000 runs in ODIs - 21 innings."

132,"Head to Umar Akmal, 1 run short and wide, slapped to deep cover"
133,"Head to Babar Azam, 1 run rotation is the order of the day. Good length on off, pushed through the off side"
134,"Head to Umar Akmal, no run MISSED STUMPING! Umar Akmal obviously has a different plan than his cousin at the other end. Steps out to a good length ball outside off, his hands and eyes are looking for the midwicket boundary, but the ball has snuck through him and Wade hasn't collected that. Poor from both of them."
135,"Head to Umar Akmal, no run good length, front foot defence"
136,"Stanlake to Babar Azam, 1 run back of a length, turned down to third man"

145,"Head to Babar Azam, no run darts this one on middle and leg, solidly defended back down the pitch"
146,"Head to Babar Azam, 2 runs tipping over the bar stuff. There was a chance for Smith at short midwicket, but it was powerfully struck too. It was short, he rocked back to pull, would have been a beauty had he pulled that off"

149,"Stanlake to Umar Akmal, no run drops it gently towards backward point, looks for a single but is sent back"
150,"Stanlake to Umar Akmal, 1 wide short outside off, he sways out of the way of that. Umpire thinks it was way over his head, good call"

159,"Head to Umar Akmal, 1 run gets forward and eases it wide of cover as they complete a quick single"
160,"Head to Babar Azam, SIX runs long, long boundary at deep midwicket, but it doesn't matter for Babar. Sees the flight, gets down on one knee, underneath the flight followed by the free swing to get the slog sweep over the ropes. Super shot, what confidence to play that stroke!"
161,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run length ball outside off, he gets forward and blocks"
162,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run awkward bounce but he does well to open the bat face late to ease it down to third man. He was initially trying to sway out of the way"

165,"Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run hustles him with a pacy bouncer outside off, Umar gets on top of the bounce and dabs it to the off side. Pressure building"

171,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run width and he's slapped that to deep cover, no more than a single since there's protection there. Cheer from the Pakistan fans as the 200 is up"

176,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run bouncer outside off at 140kph, he sways out of the way of that delivery"
177,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run this is a rip roaring bouncer that leaves Wade flinging to his left to get a hand on that. Azam arched back to sway out of the way. The ball swung back in a long way after it passed the batsman. Wade has the presence of mind to flick the ball back and prevent the batmen from scampering a bye"
178,"Cummins to Babar Azam, no run dropped chance, would have been a stunner had he held on. This is a flat batted pull which he looks to swat over Cummins's head. He puts his hand out on the follow-through but catches like those should stick."
179,"Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 1 run full outside off, pushed to long-off as they jog the single"
180,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, FOUR runs shot of a man who is now seeing this like a football. Length ball on middle and leg, Azam brings his wrists into the picture to whip the ball up and over wide mid-on, one bounce into the boundary."
181,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run punched past the bowler to long-off as they take an easy single"
182,"Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 1 run slower and fuller on off, dabbed to cover for a quick single"

184,"Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 1 run length ball on middle and leg, eased to long-on"
185,"Cummins to Imad Wasim, OUT slapped over the infield, but that is an outstanding catch by Travis Head running backwards from mid-off. He had to be mindful of Maxwell running from cover, but the loud and clear call allowed him to back off. Having made the early call, aided by a head start, he kept his eyes on the ball and then"
186,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run guides it from the crease to point"
187,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run cramped for room, beaten for pace as he defends to the off side again"
188,"Cummins to Rizwan, 2 runs super timing! Faulkner at third man comes around towards deep point to cut that off. It was just a glide using the bowler's pace"

190,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run chopped to point, Maxwell moves swiftly to his left to cut that off."
191,"Hazlewood to Amir, no run hangs back and looks to ramp it over the keeper's head, but is done in by the bounce. He was off balance too when he tried to play it"
192,"Hazlewood to Amir, 1 run he comes into play immediately. Amir backs away and angles it down to there. Looked to play it wide of point initially"
193,"Hazlewood to Rizwan, no run looks to force that off the back foot but can't get behind the line, awkwardly defends it back to the bowler"
194,"Hazlewood to Rizwan, no run gets out of the line to scoop it over the keeper's head, but the bounce on the surface meant it was always going to be an arduous task"
195,"Hazlewood to Rizwan, 1 run turns the incoming length delivery towards deep square. Warner was coming in but the two was always on, except he slipped while turning for the second"
196,"Hazlewood to Amir, no run looked to swing that to Perth's CBD, but couldn't connect. Backed away to go over long on, cross-batted, nowhere near the pitch or the line. Beaten"
197,"Hazlewood to Umar Akmal, no run angles a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, not much room for Akmal to work with, defended back down the pitch"
198,"Hazlewood to Umar Akmal, no run short of length ball on off stump, he takes his bottom hand off the grip and defends that"
199,"Hazlewood to Umar Akmal, 1 run hops back and opens the bat face late to run it down to third man"
200,"Hazlewood to Babar Azam, 1 run hint of width outside off is enough for him to chop that down to third man"
201,"Hazlewood to Umar Akmal, 1 run hops back, eases it down to third man using the bowler's pace"
202,"Hazlewood to Babar Azam, no run looks to touch and run, but Hazlewood does well to hare across and prevent both batsmen from doing that"
203,"Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 1 run direct hit at the bowler's end would have resulted in Akmal's dismissal. Pat Cummins the fielder at point. Super pick up, rocket throw but just wide of the stumps"

207,"Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 1 run opens the bat face to run it down to third man, but doesn't have the width or pace to beat the man there, a single nonetheless"
208,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run backs away and muscles the slower ball over cover, but on the bounce to the fielder. Didn't generate the kind of power he would have liked"
209,"Cummins to Rizwan, no run caught on the hop as he looks to tuck it fine. Struggling to lay bat on ball at the moment. Hit high on the thigh pas this time"
210,"Cummins to Rizwan, FOUR runs I'm sure even Rizwan has no clue how he has managed to scoop that fine over short fine. Shaped to play, but looked away so that he isn't in danger of being hit if there's a top edge. Somehow gets his willow to the line of the ball and the deflection bounces into the ropes"

220,"Faulkner to Amir, 1 run slapped over the infield, but on the bounce to deep point. As far as last overs go, you can't get better than that"
221,"3.00pm First thoughts? Pakistan are at least 40 short of where they should have been. Babar Azam was sensational and became the joint-fastest to 1000 ODI runs during the course of his 84. But the pressure of being unable to score quickly towards the end got him to play a big shot. The early running was done by Sharjeel Khan, before"
222,"Welcome back, folks."
223,Okay the batsmen are out and this is interesting. Sharjeel has brought out the helmet and is at short leg. Hafeez is opening the bowling.

247,"Amir to Khawaja, no run back of a length outside off, slight swing away, left well alone"
248,"Junaid to Warner, no run good length angled into the pads, Warner continues to stay back to that length. Tries to hoick it over square leg but gets caught in front of the stumps. Big appeal, but there might've been an inside edge"
249,"Junaid to Warner, FOUR runs Oh boy. What a shot that is. Good length and angled into him again, and this time his trust of the bounce pays off. He whips it off the back foot over midwicket"

264,"Junaid to Khawaja, no run CLOSE! Warner just makes his ground after Khawaja pushes a good length ball to mid-on and sends Warner back after taking off. Poor running from him. Malik dives and recovers quickly. Shies at the stumps and would've been out with a direct hit. But he misses."

271,"Amir to Warner, 1 run good length in the corridor, shaping away, thick outside edge to third man"
272,"Junaid to Warner, FOUR runs back of a length on middle stump, leans back and plays an ugly swat across the line. Gets an inside age and it just keeps running away from Imad Wasim and into the square leg boundary"

278,"Amir to Khawaja, no run superb from Amir! Good length, starts on middle and off, swings away and past the outside edge, and there seems to be a sound as it flies to the keeper. They appeal loudly, it's turned down. No review. Snicko shows a sound, but it is after the ball passes the bat"

286,"Junaid to Handscomb, 4 runs wow! Gets a bouncer, slaps it high into the sky, it comes down and plonks into the outfield, rolls for two yards, and stops short of the boundary. They run four. First runs in ODIs, should've been out for zero"
