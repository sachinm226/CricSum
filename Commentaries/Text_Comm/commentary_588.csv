0,9.25am Australia have won the toss and will bat.
1,"Edwards to Marsh, 1 run stays over the wicket to the left hander who squeezes a full and swinging delivery out to square and they're off the mark immediately"
2,"Edwards to Watson, 1 run bangs in short, some swing away, Watson squares behind it, the outside edge not carrying to second slip, bouncing just in front. Some immediate encouragement for West Indies and Edwards, however"
3,"Edwards to Marsh, no run good ball, some decent carry and at 85.2mph, nips away off the seam after pitching on a good length and the batsman quickly draws his bat in"
4,"Edwards to Marsh, no run again some good pace and carry off the deck, it's left as it comes in on a good length"
5,"Edwards to Marsh, no run fired again across him, flatter this time, left alone"
6,"Edwards to Marsh, no run on off stump, defended on the front foot into the covers with a slight push and they decide not to run"
7,"Powell to Watson, 1 run some movement off the seam back in to the right hander, Powell generating plenty of awkward bounce. In the end it's tucked down off the hips in line with off"
8,"Powell to Marsh, no run shortish ball on off, coming across him, the batsman caught in two minds shaping initially for the pull and ends up stopping on the shot"
9,"Powell to Marsh, FOUR runs gets hold of the pull this time! Just a fraction short from Powell and Marsh is so quick to tranfer his weight and send it fairly aerial - deliberately - and straight through square"
10,"Powell to Marsh, no run hustles up to him now, the ball slanting across him and the batsman shapes to cut but it goes through"
11,"Powell to Marsh, no run stifled appeal but the batsman had got some bat on to it as he tried to squeeze to square - the ball also pitched outside leg"
12,"Powell to Marsh, FOUR runs short and cut hard off the back foot through point. The shot was there for the making"
13,"Edwards to Watson, no run some width outside off, driven straight to the man at cover"
14,"Edwards to Watson, no run big width outside off, cut down without much power, into the turf and on towards first slip, Gayle putting both hands above his head and parrying it down"
15,"Edwards to Watson, no run fired flat and hard down the channel, Watson looks to cut but the ball deceives him as it nips back in off the seam and goes over the blade"
16,"Edwards to Watson, no run some swing outside off and down the channel, probing once more and beating Watson again who offers the shot off the back foot, stuck in his crease - no footwork of which to speak"
17,"Edwards to Watson, FOUR runs strays on to the legs now and Watson breaks the shackles with a strong clip off the legs through square"
18,"Edwards to Watson, FOUR runs on the legs once more and again it's turned off the legs for some more easy runs"

21,"Powell to Marsh, 1 run on the legs again and turned out firmly to deep square and they will collect just the single"

24,"Powell to Marsh, 1 run tapped away to short midwicket on the legs"

26,"Edwards to Marsh, (no ball) FOUR runs oh! Just wide of the diving man at point, Marshall, but it's a no-ball as well and so up comes the free hit"
27,"Edwards to Marsh, FOUR runs short on the legs and he stands tall and almost-Hayden-like, he shoulders the ball through midwicket"
28,"Edwards to Marsh, 2 runs width outside off, cuts hard off the back foot, a good diving effort on the third man boundary by Miller, the left-hand spinner running round from his left"

270,"Lee to Marshall, no run Marshall forward and defends, Lee appeals for lbw and it might have flicked the top of the pad before rocketing off the middle of the bat, but certainly outside the line of off"
271,"Lee to Marshall, no run a wild attempted drive from Marshall, who flashes outside off and sees the ball whizz past the bat"
272,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run Sarwan crunches this one wide of point where Clarke makes a terrific diving stop, then turns and throws to the bowler's end where Sarwan was a long, long way short. Lucky for him, Clarke's throw was wide"
273,"Johnson to Marshall, 1 run and there's a very quick single, Marshall pushes to cover and scampers through. Symonds is the fielder, he under-arms it into the stumps at the bowler's end but Marshall gets home, you've got to be mighty fast to beat Symonds"
274,"Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run another fast run as Sarwan pokes it to mid on, David Hussey's throw misses at the bowler's end"
275,"Johnson to Marshall, 1 wide short and down leg side, so that's a wide"
276,"Johnson to Marshall, no run straight-bat defence this time, Johnson gets across to cut it off, another shy at the stumps, this time at the striker's end as Marshall was initially wanting a single, the throw missed though"
277,"Johnson to Marshall, no run Marshall drives at this one outside off, it beats the bat"
278,"Johnson to Marshall, 1 run on the pads and it's tucked away through midwicket for a single"
279,"Lee to Marshall, no run on the back foot and punches this one to cover"
280,"Lee to Marshall, 1 run straight ball this time, Marshall clips it away through square leg"
281,"Lee to Sarwan, no run dead on line again and it stays down a touch, Sarwan jumps then has to adjust and does well to get the bat down on this one"
282,"Lee to Sarwan, 1 run driven away to cover and they get a single"
283,"Lee to Marshall, no run oh, there's a thick edge from Marshall and it falls just a few centimetres short of Watson at first slip. A stroke of luck for Marshall"
284,"Lee to Marshall, no run forward and he defends this back down the pitch"
285,"Johnson to Sarwan, no run driven off the back foot to cover and there's no run"
286,"Johnson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan backs away and tries for an expansive cut, the shortish one from Johnson bounces a touch too much and beats the bat"
287,"Johnson to Sarwan, no run another shortish ball, Sarwan looks to pull but mistimes it and the ball lobs just in front of mid on"
288,"Johnson to Sarwan, OUT excellent catch! Sarwan knows he has to get the runs flowing and drives on the up, but it's a slower ball and he doesn't quite time it, the ball looks like clearing James Hopes at mid off but he times his leap to perfection and snare"

290,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 run Chanderpaul gets off the mark deflecting this one behind point"
291,"Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 wide down leg side and that's a wide, Lee doesn't think it should have been but every umpire will call those"
292,"Lee to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs short and on leg, Chanderpaul hooks and it flies over the short fine leg and away to the boundary"
293,"Lee to Chanderpaul, no run Chanderpaul looks to cut this one, it beats the bat"
294,"Lee to Chanderpaul, no run good ball, fuller length and nipping back in to the left-hander, Chanderpaul good enough to defend"
295,"Lee to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs excellent shot, Chanderpaul drives this one sweetly through the vacant cover region for four"
296,"Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 run doesn't quite get this one right as he attempts to repeat the shot, a thick inside egde races past the stumps"
297,"Lee to Marshall, no run outside off, Marshall defends"
298,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs well struck, this one is on the stumps and a half-volley, Chanderpaul simply lifts this one over midwicket and with the field up that's two bounces over the boundary"
299,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run prodded away into the on side"
300,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 run outside off now, Chanderpaul cuts it away behind point"
301,"Johnson to Marshall, no run prodded away defensively to cover"
302,"Johnson to Marshall, no run dropped! Nathan Bracken puts this one down at short fine leg. Johnson puts it on the pads, Marshall flicks it on the up and Bracken crouches down and fumbles what he definitely should have taken"
303,"Johnson to Marshall, no run punched away through the off side"
304,"Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 wide short and down leg side, that's a wide"

308,"Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 wide bad ball, Lee drags this one short and well down leg side"
309,"Lee to Chanderpaul, 2 runs pulled away through midwicket and they get a couple"
310,"Lee to Chanderpaul, no run this one beats the bat, Chanderpaul looking to cut behind point and it gets a bit too close to him"
311,"Lee to Chanderpaul, no run guided away to gully"
312,"Johnson to Marshall, no run punched away towards point"
313,"Johnson to Marshall, FOUR runs good timing from Marshall, this one is right on line and driven straight back past the bowler"
314,"Johnson to Marshall, 1 wide wide of off, he tries for a big drive but it's too wide"
315,"Johnson to Marshall, 1 run guided away behind point this time"
316,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run driven to mid on"
317,"Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 run short outside off, Chanderpaul cuts in the air and it bounces away to third man"
