2,"Agar to Roy, no run tries to uses the feet, darted in on off and Roy squeezes the bat down on it"
3,"Agar to Roy, no run well bowled, gives this some air and it drifts in before spinning away past the bat, Wade then takes off the bails for good measure but Roy hadn't moved out of his ground"

8,"Cummins to Roy, 2 runs goes back and across and this time steers the ball deliberately wide of third man, comes racing back for two - wave of the bat for an attractive fifty from just 34 balls"
9,"Cummins to Roy, 1 run length outside off, Roy runs another one down to third man"

17,"Agar to Roy, 1 run pushed through a bit quicker outside off, Roy steers it away through cover point"

19,"Cummins to Roy, no run full, 92mph outside off, pushed watchfully into the covers"
20,"Cummins to Roy, FOUR runs phwoar, that's four! Short outside off, Roy rocks back and uses the pace, swats it aerially over backward point and away to the fence"

60,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run pushed square into the off side"

143,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run on the stumps, comes forward and clips one down the ground"

222,"5.30pm: England have posted 300 but it was with something of a whimper, after they were 205 for 2 with 17 overs to go. We'll have to wait a couple of hours before we can properly evaluate James Taylor's hundred, I think - he certainly held England together, as wickets fell in the latter overs, but there will be plenty who think this is a below-par score. What is certain is"
223,"Welcome back, folks. Gnasher with you for the start of the chase. Should be an interesting one. Australia one good innings away from wrapping up the series, but England have a decent total to bowl at. Steven Finn will open the bowling..."

347,"Ali to Bailey, 1 run angled in with the arm and Bailey again leaves the crease to on drive down the ground"

355,"Rashid to Bailey, no run tossed up, leaves the crease and squirts a leading edge to short straight mid0off"
356,"Rashid to Bailey, 1 run even slower, there's some turn again and an outside edge runs into a gap at cover to keep Bailey on strike"
357,"Ali to Bailey, no run tossed up outside off and spinning in as Bailey advances and is hit on the pad"
358,"Ali to Bailey, no run Bailey leaves his crease early again, Moeen drags it down and the ball loops off the pads again as Bailey pulls out of the shot"

383,"Ali to Maxwell, OUT tries a reverse dab this time, a top edge loops up and Bairstow takes a simple catch! Umpire Wilson slowly raises his finger and although Maxwell looks disgusted it is probably with the shot rather than the decision.

451,"Plunkett to Agar, OUT amazing! Roy holds what turns into a screamer. Agar launched this miles into the night sky and into the lights. Roy steadies himself at long on, but slightly misjudges it and the ball spills out as he falls backwards but, astonishingly, he is able to hold the rebound before the ball falls to the ground. A touch of fortune, yes, but some mind-bo"
