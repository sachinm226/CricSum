214,"Abbas to Khawaja, FOUR runs slugged to midwicket! Khawaja is into the 90s with a mow into the leg side off a length delivery. Plenty of bottom hand, and excellent timing"

245,"Usman Shinwari to Maxwell, FOUR runs should have been caught at fine leg! It was angled down leg from around the wicket, he flicked it in the air off his pads, the man was too far in off the rope at fine leg, it went over his head but landed inside the rope, one bounce four!"

279,"Abbas to Marsh, 1 run full into leg stump, he drives firmly to long on"
280,"Junaid to Marsh, 1 wide full toss fired way down the leg side. Attempted yorker went horribly wrong there"
281,"Junaid to Marsh, OUT caught at mid off! What a diving catch by Abid Ali! But he's hurt his shoulder! It was a short ball banged in, it bounced very high, Marsh tried to flat bat it down the ground, it balloons off the splice and flies straight of mid on, Abid sprints to his left and dives full length to take a spectacular catch"
282,"Junaid to Maxwell, FOUR runs short ball, whacked over square leg for four! Too easy. This just sat up, he was back and waiting for it, he didn't time it but got enough of it to get to the rope"

291,"Haris Sohail to Stoinis, 1 run shorter length, he's back and crunching this to long off"
292,"Haris Sohail to Maxwell, SIX runs shorter length, he backs away and flat bats this high to long off and it carries all the way! He didn't nail it but such is the power he can clear the fence off the back foot over long off"

301,"Junaid to Maxwell, OUT Bowled him! Off stump sent flying! He tried the conventional ramp, but moved too far inside the line, Junaid fired full and straight and beat him for pace, it cannoned into off stump and sent it cartwheeling"
302,"Junaid to Carey, no run 134kph, good length, tailing in, cramping him for room, he punches it back to the bowler"
303,"Junaid to Carey, 5 wide full toss fired way down the leg side and Rizwan stands no chance of stopping it! Five wides. An attempted leg stump yorker gone horribly wrong"
304,"Junaid to Carey, OUT LBW! Carey reviews . It was a good length, tailing in towards off, he tried to paddle it fine, it missed the bat and hit the pad infront of off stump. Michael Gough gave it out straight away. Ball tracking says it's hitting leg stump flush! It's out"

307,"Usman Shinwari to Handscomb, OUT LBW! This looked plumb! He shuffled down a step and tried to swing a full ball over the leg side, he missed and was hit on the back leg infront of off stump. Fairly straight forward decision for the umpire. No review for Australia in any case"

312,That is the second highest ODI score at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. It will take some chasing. Liam will be back to take you through the start of the chase.
313,Innings break Australia post a monstrous total. It was just third time Australia's top four have posted 50 or more in an ODI. It was set up by a huge opening stand of 134. Khawaja fell just short of a third ODI century. Finch and Marsh played well but Maxwell was electric making 70 from 33 balls. Usman Shinwari bowled magnificently to take 4 for 49 but the rest really copped some tap.
314,"We're just about good to resume. The break was shortened slightly as the first innings ended almost 15 minutes over time. Behrendorff will kick things off for Australia, with Shan Masood on strike"
315,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run on a length, and shaping back in to the left hander, who defends down the track"
316,"Behrendorff to Masood, 1 run and Shan's away with a flick off his pads, the ball rolling through square leg"

322,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run Richardson keeps it tight on off stump, Haris defending from the crease"
323,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run slightly fuller, and Haris is drawn into a drive that is stopped at cover"

325,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run that's better, angling in to the channel outside off to test Haris' defence"
326,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run straighter, and it's tucked softly into the leg side, mid on fielding cleanly"
327,"Behrendorff to Masood, 1 run too straight from Behrendorff, but Khawaja does well at short fine leg to save runs, diving to stop Shan's glance"
328,"Behrendorff to Haris Sohail, 2 runs sliced up and over mid off, the ball looping high over the fielder and then plugging in the outfield as they scoot back for the second. The intent was there, but not the execution"
329,"Behrendorff to Haris Sohail, 1 run another sliced drive, but this one flies down through the gully region, bouncing to third man"
330,"Behrendorff to Masood, 2 runs elegantly done by Shan, leaning over a full one to clip a brace through midwicket"
331,"Behrendorff to Masood, 2 runs and now through the off side, Shan driving smartly on the up and in the gap. Lyon chases it down with a slide near the boundary rope"
332,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run full and straight, and it's pushed firmly back to the bowler"
333,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run Richardson stays around the stumps and keeps it full, but there's not much in the way of swing. Haris' drive goes straight to cover"
334,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs and now straight over cover! Haris steps half forward and lifts a full length delivery deliberately up and over the cover infield"
335,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, 2 runs angled down, wide of third man, and they rush back for a second"
336,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run Richardson pulls his length back to negate Haris' driving, and it's prodded defensively to point"

343,"Behrendorff to Masood, 1 run Behrendorff finds a bit of nip in to him off the seam, but Shan is forward and covers it well, and follows that up by an immediate call for a quick single"
344,"Behrendorff to Haris Sohail, no run sweetly driven, but a dive from Handscomb in the covers saves runs"
345,"Kane Richardson to Masood, 2 runs Shan uses Richardson's angle from around the stumps to collect two more through the gap at midwicket"
346,"Kane Richardson to Masood, 1 run pad first? The umpire doesn't think so, and Australia don't review. Shan was waiting on a late dab, but the ball angled in to cramp him for room. It was also high, so even if it was pad first it wouldn't have been out"
347,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, 1 run on a length, just outside off, and it's pressed firmly to cover. There's just enough room for a quick single"
348,"Kane Richardson to Masood, FOUR runs cracked through point! Too short from Richardson, and too wide. Shan had some work to do to get on top of the bounce, jumping up to cut hard down on the ball, beating point"
349,"Kane Richardson to Masood, no run fuller, straighter, and it's pushed back to the bowler"
350,"Kane Richardson to Masood, 1 run Shan hops again, this time to work a single to midwicket"
351,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run punched to cover, on the up but not into the gap"
352,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run another drive from Shan as Behrendorff offers a hint of width, but he finds the field"

354,"Behrendorff to Masood, FOUR runs beautifully timed by Shan, who is once again offered width outside off. He let the ball come on to the bat, but had to place it just right to beat point's right and third man's left. He did both"
355,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run straighter this time, and it's driven to mid on"
356,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run Shan steps into a punchy little drive, but picks out mid off"

359,"Lyon to Masood, 1 run worked into the gap towards midwicket, just the one"
360,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, 1 run Haris advances, pushing to cover with bat and pad together. There's an appeal, the thinking possibly being that it hit pad first, but he's miles down the track"
361,"Lyon to Masood, 1 run nudged into the leg side for one"
362,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, 1 run Haris waits, deep in the crease, and follows Shan by nudging a single into the leg side"
363,"Behrendorff to Haris Sohail, SIX runs swatted over long on! Haris knows what to expect from Behrendorff and just sets himself at the crease to power a length delivery back over the bowler, and over the boundary"
364,"Behrendorff to Haris Sohail, 1 run tucked to Finch at midwicket, who dives to stop it but then throws unnecessarily at the stumps and they find a single off a sloppy throw"

368,"Behrendorff to Masood, no run driven on the up, but straight to mid off"
369,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, 1 run punched firmly off the back foot, but Stoinis gets around from mid off and dives to keep them to one. It was a boundary if it passed him"
370,"Lyon to Masood, no run Shan backs away, looking to make room, but his shot finds cover"
371,"Lyon to Masood, 1 run whipped into the leg side, deep midwicket keeping them to one. Lyon's not pitching too many up so far in this spell"
372,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, no run Haris jumps down the track again, thrusting his leg at the ball to pad it away. There's an appeal from Lyon, but it's unconvincing"

379,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, no run slapped, on the up, to point"
380,"Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs edged, and past the wicketkeeper! Had there been a first slip in place, this would have landed in his lap. Perfect length from Richardson, Haris prodding at the ball as it angled across him"
381,"Lyon to Masood, 1 run cut out to deep point, off the back foot"
382,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, 2 runs another back foot punch, and the sweeper out on the cover boundary has more work to do"
383,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, no run Lyon floats this one a little fuller, Haris pressing forward to defend"
384,"Lyon to Haris Sohail, 1 run Haris uses his feet to get close to it, driving down to long off"
385,"Lyon to Masood, 1 run angling in to him from around the stumps, and Shan works him through midwicket yet again"

391,"Kane Richardson to Masood, 1 run appeal for lbw, but the umpire is not interested and Australia don't review it. It might have pitched outside leg"

393,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run floated up outside off at 84km/h, and it's pushed watchfully to cover"
394,"Maxwell to Masood, 2 runs full and Shan drives to long off. Ah, and the throw isn't a great one, arriving at Carey on the bounce. He can't stop it cleanly, and there's overthrows"
395,"Maxwell to Masood, 1 run"
396,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run pushed through fuller, and flatter at 89km/h. It's dead-batted into the leg side, and they pinch a quick single"

398,"Maxwell to Masood, 1 run Shan dances out to meet it on the full, slashing a drive out to the sweeper"

597,"Behrendorff to Imad Wasim, FOUR runs slashed down to third man! The fielder was up at short third man, so Imad just had to get it past him. Behrendorff helped by bowling it short of a good length, outside off, and though the shot was little more than a thick edge it's brought a vital boundary"
598,"Kane Richardson to Yasir Shah, no run Yasir slams a length ball straight back at Richardson, who fields off his own bowling. Imad had wandered way out of his crease, looking to get back on strike, but Richardson decides not to throw down the stumps! He had time, and all three to aim at"
