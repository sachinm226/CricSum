0,"Out come Darren Sammy and George Bailey along with Ranjan Madugalle, the match referee. Bailey spins the coin, Sammy calls heads and heads it is. So Sammy has won the toss and West Indies are batting first. Sammy says this pitch looks like a Trinidad wicket. Just the one expected change for West Indies: Dwayne Bravo in for his broth"
1,"Starc to Charles, no run nice swing first up, 136ks, on a length well outside off, then shaping back in. Charles leaves it alone"
2,"Starc to Charles, no run fuller, nearly a half-volley, driven square to cover-point"
3,"Starc to Charles, no run nice, straighter and swinging in, Charles has to hurry lest he be called dead plumb"
4,"Starc to Charles, 1 wide this one swings away. Really full, and starts wide too, and called wide"
5,"Starc to Charles, no run full and straight now, nearly a yorker, dug out to mid-on"
6,"Starc to Charles, no run full, widish, driven square, to cover-point"
7,"Starc to Charles, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven wide of mid-on, takes the single. Gayle kept away from the strike for some more"
8,"Watson to Charles, 1 leg bye Charles moves well across to a full delivery, and lucky the ball is too straight, otherwise he would have been lbw"
9,"Watson to Gayle, 1 run and the big man steals a quick single. Pushed straight to mid-off, who is sitting back because of the Gayle force, and they run a single"
10,"Watson to Charles, no run full, on off, pushed to mid-on"
11,"Watson to Charles, FOUR runs Charles opens up. First boundary of the second semi-final. Fullish, into the pads, he opens up front leg, and lofts this over midwicket. It meets the boundary cushions on a half-volley"
12,"Watson to Charles, no run plays a tentative defensive shot now, gets an inside edge to a full delivery"
13,"Watson to Charles, FOUR runs that's a swipe. Good-old Twenty20 swipe. Clears the front leg, and goes right across the line, hoping for the best as he does so. And it goes uppishly, but wide of mid-on"
14,"Starc to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging away as expected, gets a thick outside edge of the defensive bat for a single to third man"
15,"Starc to Charles, 1 run full and wide, driven without getting close to it, gets a soft edge on it, which falls well short of slip, but White is superb at slip"
16,"Starc to Gayle, no run dug in short, 137ks, Gayle plays the defensive shot off the front foot"
17,"Starc to Gayle, 1 wide dug in again, looking to tuck him up, but strays too far down leg"
18,"Starc to Gayle, 1 run thick edge again. Two moral victories for Starc. Gayle gets a second single to third man"
19,"Starc to Charles, OUT Charles is gone. Starc has struck. Perhaps this attack is too good for him. Starc has been swinging the ball back in, but this is short of a length, and goes with the angle. All Charles manages is an edge through to Wade"
20,"Starc to Samuels, 1 run and he produces a thick inside edge right away, which goes for a single to fine leg"
21,"Cummins to Samuels, 1 run short of a length, angling in, dropped into the leg side for one"
22,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 run short of a length, pitching outside leg, angling towards leg, worked away for another single"

26,"Cummins to Gayle, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover-point"
27,"Watson to Samuels, 1 leg bye length ball, into the pads, that was a freebie, but he concedes just the leg-bye"
28,"Watson to Gayle, no run Gayle swings and misses. Watson nearly gets his man. He clears the front leg and goes over cow corner, but all he connects is thin air"
29,"Watson to Gayle, no run Watson slips in the bouncer, and Gayle ducks under it"
30,"Watson to Gayle, 1 leg bye appeal for leg-before, but this is short of a length, not swinging, and hitting middle and leg, so it has to be pitched outside leg"
31,"Watson to Samuels, 1 run full and straight, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
32,"Watson to Gayle, SIX runs Gayle 1, Watson 0. Deep deep into the stands. Length ball, outside off, Gayle goes straight now, and makes a sweet connection. And it sails over long-off"
33,"Doherty to Samuels, no run and edge first up. Samuels is lucky it has not carries to slip as he opens the face"
34,"Doherty to Samuels, no run Samuels is lucky again. This was dead plumb. Umpire Dar has had a slip. This is full, pitches middle, straightens, and is missing both the leg and off stumps. Samuels has got away with one here"
35,"Doherty to Samuels, no run short, gets a bottom edge on the cut"
36,"Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs Samuels gets into the six-hitting act. Full, middle and leg, pretty similar to the leg-before delivery, but he has lofted it clean over long-on"
37,"Doherty to Samuels, 1 run cut away in front of square"
38,"Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs this was on the cards, but to the first ball he aces from regulation left-arm spin? Doherty stays round the stumps to cut the angle, but he still lands it in Gayle's swinging zone, and Gayle sends it rows behind deep midwicket"
39,"Hogg to Samuels, SIX runs never mind the bat's thickness. This one was played so well he could have hit a six with a ruler. Right down to the pitch of the ball, dead straight, and off the middle of the bat"
40,"Hogg to Samuels, no run a grubber. Samuels is beaten by the low bounce, Wade does well to collect it and attempt a stumping. When he played the cut, Samuels was outside the crease, but got the back foot back in time"
41,"Hogg to Samuels, no run googly, Samuels seems to have picked it off the pitch, but has recovered well to defend"
42,"Hogg to Samuels, no run the legbreak now, but a bit too short. Samuels, though, finds point with the cut"
43,"Hogg to Samuels, no run wrong'un again. The line outside leg seems to be a giveaway, but he draws another defensive shot out of Samuels"
44,"Hogg to Samuels, 1 run they had Gayle where they wanted him, taking a tight single as Samuels dabbed it to backward point, but those strides are big enough to get him in in time"
45,"Cummins to Samuels, FOUR runs no, he bowls full, and pays the price. Sameuls moves half-forward, makes room by opening the front leg a bit, and then smacks it over extra cover. Split seconds later, it hits the advertising boards"
46,"Cummins to Samuels, OUT Timbahhh. Slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. Samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower one"

48,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 run slower ball, short of a length, punched square for a single"

53,"Hogg to Bravo, no run it's a googly first up, Bravo stays back and pushes it to Watson at point"
54,"Hogg to Bravo, FOUR runs David Hussey's first touch in this tournament is a no-touch. And what a shot he has had to field first up. An inside-out loft from Bravo that bounces just short of him at long-off and then bursts through the hands"
55,"Hogg to Bravo, no run flighted nicely, defended"
56,"Hogg to Bravo, no run quicker delivery, and if not a googly it at least went on with the angle. Beats the Bravo cut"
57,"Doherty to Gayle, no run short of a length, not in his swinging arc, and Gayle defends"
58,"Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full, on off, in his swinging arc, and it goes for a flat six over long-on. Not surprising. Caught well by a policeman in front of the sight screen"

60,"Doherty to Bravo, 1 run X man slows it down now, cut away for an easy single"

65,"Hussey to Bravo, 1 run short, outside off, punched away for another single"
66,"Hussey to Gayle, 1 run stays full, straight and low again. Not letting him get under it. Another single to long-on"
67,"Hussey to Bravo, 4 byes is that a difficult difficult drop?. No it's byes. A real toughie. A high full toss from Hussey, which Bravo misses, and it is really asking for too much for a keeper to collect it"
68,"Hussey to Bravo, 1 run driven down the ground for another single"
69,"Starc to Bravo, 1 run full, angling in, driven to long-on"
70,"Starc to Gayle, 5 wide you can't swing it from there. Full, well down leg, five wides"

72,"Starc to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging in, pushed to long-on for one"
73,"Starc to Bravo, no run angling in, no room, pushed to midwicket"
74,"Starc to Bravo, no run full toss outside off, Bravo manages just an edge that bounces well short of Wade"

80,"Watson to Bravo, 1 run driven straight of midwicket for a single"
81,"Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs No it isn't. It's short of a length, has pitched outside leg, and Gayle has glanced this fine of the diving short fine leg"
82,"Hogg to Bravo, SIX runs wrong'un but too short, and Bravo goes right back into the crease to smack this for a flat six. Not too wide of deep midwicket, but you only have to miss them by a few feet if you hit so powerfully"
83,"Hogg to Bravo, no run full, turning in, beats him in the fight, gets a dot"
84,"Hogg to Bravo, no run Bravo is not picking them. Pushes tentatively to this full delivery, and defends it back"

87,"Hogg to Bravo, 1 run down the wicket, Hogg bowls short, Bravo gets a single to long-off"
88,"Hussey to Bravo, 1 run full, on off, driven to deep cover for one"
89,"Hussey to Gayle, FOUR runs that was a good ball. Hussey again managed to not let him get under the ball. Full, straight, low, Gayle gets an inside edge, and it hurtles across, wide of long-on. How badly do you make Gayle to mis-hit to get him out or keep him down to one?"
90,"Hussey to Gayle, SIX runs quick, 104ks, and finally Hussey lets Gayle get under the ball. And where has it gone? Second tier. Over the straight boundary, which is the long boundary. Joint-biggest six of the tournament"
91,"Hussey to Gayle, 2 runs brave attempt by Starc He has taken it on the chin. Gayle goes across the line, mis-hits, deep midwicket is interested but it is not carrying. Starc, though, goes for the catch, falls well short, is hit on the chin, but shows no pain"
92,"Hussey to Gayle, 2 leg byes"
93,"Hussey to Gayle, FOUR runs what do you do Jack? You have bowled a yorker, you have not allowed Gayle to get under the ball, and he still squeezes it fine of short third man. Fifty for Gayle. The dugout is having a ball"
94,"Cummins to Bravo, 1 run slow ball, short of a length, and punched away to deep cover"
95,"Cummins to Gayle, no run well bowled, slower short one at 110ks, Gayle pulls out of the shot. Cummins gives him the stare too"
96,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 run another slower ball, on a length, pitched outside leg, turning towards the stumps, worked away for a single"
97,"Cummins to Bravo, SIX runs this is unfair on the bowlers. Somebody has to regulate these bats. Slower ball, a clear mis-hit, it seems to have gone up into the orbit, but it clears long-off"
98,"Cummins to Bravo, OUT good field placement. It's Bailey himself at straight extra cover and Bravo has hit this length ball straight to him. Some relief for Australia, but West Indies keep coming at you with their big hitters: Pollard, Russell and Sammy to follow"
99,"Cummins to Pollard, 2 runs full, middle and off, pushed into the on side with soft hands, and they have made a belated decision to take the second, but so huge are their strides they make it easily"
100,"Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs thick inside edge. Four. No country for bowlers. Length ball, on leg, Gayle clears the front leg and swings. That beats the diving deep square"
101,"Watson to Gayle, no run slower ball, late-cuts it, finds short third man"
102,"Watson to Gayle, 1 run yorker, dug out, Watson is so desperate to keep Gayle off strike he chases after it and fields it with a slide"

104,"Watson to Pollard, 2 byes slower bouncer, Pollard sways out of it, Wade gets it on a half-volley, and lets two byes through. Gets the look from Watson"

108,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 wide called a wide. Cummins bowls the bouncer, Gayle ducks under it. Too high it is"

110,"Cummins to Pollard, no run slower offcutter, turning down leg, lucky that Pollard has found short fine. Gayle not running any tight singles now"
111,"Cummins to Pollard, FOUR runs what do you do with these batsmen and these bats? It's almost a yorker, cramping him, but Pollard has flicked it so well he has bisected long-on and deep midwicket"
112,"Starc to Gayle, SIX runs Length ball, into the pads, gone. Can't bowl length to him. Gayle has flicked this, merely flicked this, into the West Indies dugout around the midwicket area"
113,"Starc to Gayle, no run yorker, swinging in, squeezes under his bat. Rare dot"
114,"Starc to Gayle, 1 run nice again. Full, swinging in to him, can't get under it. The inside edge onto the pad yields just the one"
115,"Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs full toss, into the pads, flicked away, Michael Hussey over-runs this at deep midwicket. That's a rare rare error from Hussey. That kind of night for Australia"
116,"Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs who'dathunk it? Pollard down on a knee, under the full ball, and guiding it over the keeper's head. Gayle is so impressed he practises that shot at the non-striker's end"
117,"Starc to Pollard, 2 runs yorker, angling in from round the stumps, still place wide of long-on for two. Gayle will be on strike for the first ball of the last over"
118,"Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full toss first ball. Gayle stands tall and pulls this over midwicket for his 16th six of the tournament"
119,"Doherty to Gayle, 1 run full, on leg, misses out, takes one to short fine leg. He looks in pain when running"
120,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs that's a flat slog-sweep that doesn't seem to have much elevation on it, but it is enough to clear a leaping Hogg at deep midwicket who gets a hand on it"
121,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs low full toss, wide outside off, Pollard clears the front leg and hits it for a six over long-off. This is carnage. Call the ambulance. It's a car wreck, this over"
122,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs Gayle is dancing already. First 200 of the tournament. Full, middle and leg, smoked straight for yet another six. Gayle can't wait for after the match"
123,"Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight"
124,"Starc to Charles, no run nice swing first up, 136ks, on a length well outside off, then shaping back in. Charles leaves it alone"

208,"Cummins to Bravo, SIX runs this is unfair on the bowlers. Somebody has to regulate these bats. Slower ball, a clear mis-hit, it seems to have gone up into the orbit, but it clears long-off"
209,"Cummins to Bravo, OUT good field placement. It's Bailey himself at straight extra cover and Bravo has hit this length ball straight to him. Some relief for Australia, but West Indies keep coming at you with their big hitters: Pollard, Russell and Sammy to follow"
210,"Cummins to Pollard, 2 runs full, middle and off, pushed into the on side with soft hands, and they have made a belated decision to take the second, but so huge are their strides they make it easily"
211,"Watson to Bravo, no run length ball, angling into the pads, and he misses on that"
212,"Watson to Bravo, no run short of a length, no room, defended back"
213,"Watson to Bravo, 2 runs flicked away extravagantly, and he wrists it away wide of a diving Bailey at midwicket"
214,"Watson to Bravo, SIX runs and Bravo starts hitting sixes now. Length ball, middle and leg, and he moves forward to loft this over long-on: six sixes and three fours off the bat so far"
215,"Watson to Bravo, 1 run driven straight of midwicket for a single"
216,"Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs No it isn't. It's short of a length, has pitched outside leg, and Gayle has glanced this fine of the diving short fine leg"
217,"Hogg to Bravo, SIX runs wrong'un but too short, and Bravo goes right back into the crease to smack this for a flat six. Not too wide of deep midwicket, but you only have to miss them by a few feet if you hit so powerfully"
218,"Hogg to Bravo, no run full, turning in, beats him in the fight, gets a dot"
219,"Hogg to Bravo, no run Bravo is not picking them. Pushes tentatively to this full delivery, and defends it back"
220,"Hogg to Bravo, 1 run tries the big drive, never mind reading the spin, gets an edge to short third man"
221,"Hogg to Gayle, 1 run quicker lebreak, Gayle waits for it, and opens the face to take a single"
222,"Hogg to Bravo, 1 run down the wicket, Hogg bowls short, Bravo gets a single to long-off"
223,"Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs thick inside edge. Four. No country for bowlers. Length ball, on leg, Gayle clears the front leg and swings. That beats the diving deep square"
224,"Watson to Gayle, no run slower ball, late-cuts it, finds short third man"
225,"Watson to Gayle, 1 run yorker, dug out, Watson is so desperate to keep Gayle off strike he chases after it and fields it with a slide"
226,"Watson to Pollard, no run short of a length, no room, defended off the front foot"
227,"Watson to Pollard, 2 byes slower bouncer, Pollard sways out of it, Wade gets it on a half-volley, and lets two byes through. Gets the look from Watson"
228,"Watson to Pollard, 1 run slower legcutter, pushed into the off side, keeps the strike"
229,"Cummins to Pollard, 2 runs full, into the pads, 147ks, the bottom edge goes for two"
230,"Cummins to Pollard, 1 run low full toss, can't get under it, hit to long-on. Gayle almost walks the single"
231,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 wide called a wide. Cummins bowls the bouncer, Gayle ducks under it. Too high it is"
232,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 run Bailey has saved three here. This was smashed with some force to his left at extra cover, and he put a full-length dive in"
233,"Cummins to Pollard, no run slower offcutter, turning down leg, lucky that Pollard has found short fine. Gayle not running any tight singles now"
234,"Cummins to Pollard, FOUR runs what do you do with these batsmen and these bats? It's almost a yorker, cramping him, but Pollard has flicked it so well he has bisected long-on and deep midwicket"
235,"Starc to Gayle, SIX runs Length ball, into the pads, gone. Can't bowl length to him. Gayle has flicked this, merely flicked this, into the West Indies dugout around the midwicket area"
236,"Starc to Gayle, no run yorker, swinging in, squeezes under his bat. Rare dot"
237,"Starc to Gayle, 1 run nice again. Full, swinging in to him, can't get under it. The inside edge onto the pad yields just the one"
238,"Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs full toss, into the pads, flicked away, Michael Hussey over-runs this at deep midwicket. That's a rare rare error from Hussey. That kind of night for Australia"
239,"Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs who'dathunk it? Pollard down on a knee, under the full ball, and guiding it over the keeper's head. Gayle is so impressed he practises that shot at the non-striker's end"
240,"Starc to Pollard, 2 runs yorker, angling in from round the stumps, still place wide of long-on for two. Gayle will be on strike for the first ball of the last over"
241,"Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full toss first ball. Gayle stands tall and pulls this over midwicket for his 16th six of the tournament"
242,"Doherty to Gayle, 1 run full, on leg, misses out, takes one to short fine leg. He looks in pain when running"
243,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs that's a flat slog-sweep that doesn't seem to have much elevation on it, but it is enough to clear a leaping Hogg at deep midwicket who gets a hand on it"
244,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs low full toss, wide outside off, Pollard clears the front leg and hits it for a six over long-off. This is carnage. Call the ambulance. It's a car wreck, this over"
245,"Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs Gayle is dancing already. First 200 of the tournament. Full, middle and leg, smoked straight for yet another six. Gayle can't wait for after the match"
246,"Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight"
247,"8.40pm This innings has taken 100 minutes. That tells you how much retrieving people have had to do from the stands. It's a good job they let Gayle face only 41 balls. Imagine if he had got about 60. Then again, they were so scared of Gayle they didn't seem to execute against the others. Have Gayle and his big-hitting friends killed"
248,"Well that's more like it! Hello everyone, Alex Winter here, hope you enjoyed some proper T20 action there, I bloody loved it. T20 is not about subtly or careful accumulation, nor nurdling or nudging. It is about whacking the thing miles and that's just what the Windies have given us, true Gangam Style if you like! And hopefully we g"
249,"Warner and Watson simply have to go big for Australia to have a chance here...but already there's some chat between Warner and Marlon Samuels, looked quite heated that; that shall add to the atmosphere here as Samuel Badree prepares to open the bowling..."
250,"Badree to Warner, no run tossed up outside off, firm punch to mid off"
251,"Badree to Warner, 1 run dragged down, mistimed pull to square leg, missed out really"
252,"Badree to Watson, no run back and punching an off stump ball to cover"
253,"Badree to Watson, no run back again, late cutting from off stump to backward point"
254,"Badree to Watson, 1 run back once more, cut hard but Charles dives a cover point and saves four, fine save, good work"
255,"Badree to Warner, OUT back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, Ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely Warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him! Who would have thought that, it nicked the off stump on the way through to"

260,"Samuels to Hussey, no run goes to square drive outside off and gets a bottom edge into the turf"
261,"Samuels to Hussey, no run skips through quicker and beats Hussey's push forward, close to off stump again"
262,"Samuels to Hussey, 3 runs this time gets the square drive away, past point, not timed well enough to get four"
263,"Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs quite flat outside off, chopped away behind square on the off side, this is timed well and away for four"
264,"Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs four more, behind square on the leg side this time, full on leg stump and flicked away using the pace, nicely played"
265,"Badree to Hussey, no run outside off, driven again, this time only finds cover point"
266,"Badree to Hussey, no run pushed into the off side again, only finds extra cover"
267,"Badree to Hussey, 2 runs leg stump again, flicked into the on-side, two as midwicket has to chase round quite a distance"
268,"Badree to Hussey, 1 run driven hard again, well timed again, mid off just gets round and saves four"
269,"Samuels to Hussey, OUT oh swept straight up in the air and taken by the bowler in typically nonplussed fashion. Kicks the ball away, is that how one celebrates getting rid of Hussey in a semi-final? It is if you're Marlon Samuels. It was just outside off and Hussey swung hard at it aiming over the leg side but got it off a hug"
270,"Samuels to Watson, 1 run bit of turn here, played off the hip towards short long leg from a length"
271,"Samuels to White, no run awkward push forward on off stump, gets it off an outside edge into the off side, tentative"

273,"Samuels to Watson, no run outside off, goes to sweep and misses completely, god job it was wide"

276,"Badree to Watson, no run steps back quickly to pull hard but misses, skipped on a touched quicker"
277,"Badree to Watson, OUT goes for the shame stroke, again it skips on but this is straight and out goes leg stump. Right call to keep Badree going because he's slid one past the big man. That is a massive, massive blow. It was dragged down but skidded on to Watson and he was too late with the stroke"
278,"Badree to Bailey, no run first ball tries to pull, it's nowhere near short enough to pull and goes under the stroke and thankfully for the batsman past off stump"
279,"Badree to Bailey, no run forward and blocking into the leg side"
280,"Badree to Bailey, 2 runs back and played into the leg side for a single past point"

283,"Samuels to Bailey, no run forward this time playing towards point, no run"
284,"Samuels to Bailey, no run goes to late cut again but it turns in from outside off, cramps him up and he keeps it out on the crease"

286,"Samuels to Bailey, FOUR runs four more down the ground, stepping back and slapping it past the bowler, a straight pull almost past mid off, another excellent strike"
287,"Rampaul to White, OUT full and sliding now leg, Ramdin takes it and goes up for a huge appeal and up goes the finger! Rampaul strikes first ball with a strangle down the leg side, complete luck that is, White went to flick it to leg and must have got a thin touch on it, Ramdin was convinced and so was the umpire"
288,"Rampaul to Hussey, no run bumper, well directed, a goodun, swing and a miss"
289,"Rampaul to Hussey, OUT short ball into the body, the batsman gets into a total tangle and chips a catch back to the bowler. A disgusting dismissal.

311,"Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs and again, this time wide of long off and one bounce for four, timed again, very nice"
312,"Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs goes again, gets it off the toe though and this should be easily caught but no! The fielder slips and lets it through his hands for four! Whoops"

314,"Russell to Bailey, 1 run short this time, that's well timed too, only a single though, finds the fielder at deep square, that should have gone again"

329,"Pollard to Bailey, OUT another step to leg and goes for the leg side fence taking on the deep fielder but this time picks him out. That's a very brave effort from Bailey but this time he doesn't quite time it and the man on the rope doesn't have to move to take the catch"
330,"Pollard to Cummins, OUT first ball, steps away, goes to slap it miles but gets it straight up in the air and it's taken at extra cover. Can't blame Cummins for trying but didn't get this at all after giving himself room, straight up of a big top edge and extra cover took it simply on the edge of the circle"
