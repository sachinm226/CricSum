17,"Lyon to Brownlie, 1 run back of a length and breaking in, Brownlie shuffles across to stay inside the line and works it to the leg side."
18,"Hussey to Brownlie, no run We have the first referral of the summer. Lbw appeal turned down, but this could be interesting. Back of a length from Hussey, it lands in line with off and nips in to hit him in front of leg stump. Missing leg by a mile. Australia have lost one of their two safety buttons."

23,"Hussey to Brownlie, 1 run short ball to Brownlies, guided carefully to midwicket."

27,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run back of a length again, driven from the crease towards mid-off."
28,"Siddle to Brownlie, FOUR runs poor from Siddle. NZ are rebuilding well here.. On the pads, Brownlie chirps inside the line and flicks it fine for a boundary."
29,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run every now and then one hits the seam and does something extra. Brownlie was nearly sucked into nudging this as it went away, but managed to draw the bat away at the last moment."
30,"Starc to Vettori, FOUR runs Vettori welcomes the debutant with a typical lash-pull. Short ball, not much pace on it, a couple of yards outside off and Vettori jumps onto the front foot before slapping it away like he would deal with a little rascal."
31,"Starc to Vettori, FOUR runs edged but safe The slip-gully gap has been hit a few times today. Starc's natural movement away from Vettori induces the edge as he plays away from the body, but it flies away safe."
32,"Starc to Vettori, no run this one holds its line, Vettori defends onto the pad without getting fully forward."
33,"Starc to Vettori, no run close to the money there. Vettori takes a blow on the inner thigh. Starc again gets one to hold its line as it angles in from a length. Vettori gropes outside the line and then winces."
34,"Starc to Vettori, no run looks to pull a short ball from miles and miles outside off, Vettori was in no position to play that shot."
35,"Starc to Vettori, no run back of a length on off stump, defended from the crease."
36,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run bouncer to Brownlie, and he pulls out that pre-meditated sway of his. This one doesn't really take off, and he does well to stay out of the way."
37,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run back of a length outside off, Brownlie punches from the crease into the covers."
38,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run he pitches it up now, at 143 kph, but too straight. Brownlie flicks, but finds midwicket."
39,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run length ball nips into Brownlie, who works it off the pads to the leg side."
40,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run ooh, 144 kph bustling quick ball, full outside off. Brownlie has been pushed back with a barrage of short balls and now is late getting forward for the drive. He just lurches at it without getting fully forward and across, and fails to nick it."
41,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run back of a length to end the over, Brownlie is nearly squared up but defends."
42,"Starc to Vettori, no run Starc goes right through Vettori! A series of balls going away from the seam, followed by one that nips in and Vettori's bat-pad gap is bigger than the Sydney Harbour bridge."
43,"Starc to Vettori, no run full ball on the stumps, he punch-drives fluently to mid-on."

50,"Siddle to Vettori, 2 runs 139 kph, but it seemed to stop on Vettori. Or he was early on the cover drive. Leaned away from the body to a full ball and pushed it into the covers for a couple. There was no one there to catch it, and none to stop the second either."
51,"Siddle to Vettori, 1 run shortens the length outside off, Vettori dabs it square for a single."
52,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run fullish length outside off, Brownlie leans out and defends with hard hands. Can't get the single for his efforts."
53,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run over-pitched to end the over, Brownlie drives off the bottom of the bat to mid-off."
54,"Starc to Vettori, no run 139 kph over-pitched on the stumps and Vettori digs it out to the leg side."
55,"Starc to Vettori, 2 runs where did that come from? Vettori walks across the stumps and paddle-slaps a short ball from well outside off, to fine leg. This man's batting is indescribably efficient."
56,"Starc to Vettori, no run Starc angles this right in towards the body and Vettori defends from the crease to the leg side."
57,"Starc to Vettori, 1 run again, Vettori goes on a stroll across the stumps and slaps it down to fine leg. Straight to Siddle in the deep now, so just the single."
58,"Starc to Brownlie, no run bouncer at 138 kph, banged sinfully short. Easy-peasy duck under it for Brownlie."
59,"Starc to Brownlie, FOUR runs one of Brownlie's better shots so far. Length ball angled across, offering him just enough width to free the arms and he absolutely crunched it behind point. He kept it along the ground too, it helped that he didn't have to get too far across."
60,"Lyon to Vettori, no run tossed up and straightening outside off. Vettori leaves."
61,"Lyon to Vettori, no run angled in towards the pads, defended to the leg side."
62,"Lyon to Vettori, no run tossed up on the stumps, Vettori leans out to defend."

65,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run tossed further up, he leans out and defends to the off side."
66,"Starc to Vettori, no run seams the first ball away with his natural angle from wide of off stump and Vettori lets it be."
67,"Starc to Vettori, FOUR runs and Vettori is away. Starc continues to be well short of a driving length and gets the ball to bend away from Dan, allowing him to get beside and under the ball and upper cut it over the slips intentionally. 49 now."
68,"Starc to Vettori, no run 138 kph and rapped on the pads! Australia are taking a while thinking about the review, but they decide against. And rightly so - Vettori was hit outside the line. It was short and angling in, Vettori walked across the stumps and tried to nurdle it to the leg side, but missed. Safe."
69,"Starc to Vettori, 4 runs fifty for Vettori and this has been a combative hand. Starc overcooks the yorker, and it is a full toss on the pads that Vettori smoothly deposits through midwicket with a resourceful working of the wrists. He then charges back and forth for an all-run four."
70,"Starc to Vettori, no run short again from Starc, and Vettori tries to flap it over the slips again, but misses this time."
71,"Starc to Vettori, no run closer to the driving length, but still not enough to get him driving. Vettori leaves it."
72,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run 139 kph, length ball outside off, the man with averages better than the best of them all lets it go outside off."
73,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run another leave outside off, Siddle gets a hint of away seam from a length and Brownlie leans out before shouldering arms."
74,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run three in a row. Siddle needs to get closer to off stump quickly to use the juice in the morning. This wasn't close enough to make him play."
75,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run shortens the length further at 139.4 kph, and Brownlie drops his wrists and sways back serenely."
76,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run angled into the body now, at 142 kph. Brownlie is neatly behind the line as he defends to mid-on."
77,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run 142 kph on a nice purposeful short ball to end the over, he has Brownlie hopping back to ride the bounce and fend to the off side. Well negotiated in the end, though it rapped him on the glove."
78,"Starc to Vettori, 3 runs The second name's changed, but the slogan hasn't. It is still 'pitch it up, Mitch!' Another short ball outside off and Vettori is so early in getting into position, he was ready yesterday. Pulled with a crack through midwicket, uppish but fully safe."
79,"Starc to Brownlie, FOUR runs over-pitched across the right hander, and Brownlie squeezes the cover drive off the outer edge through the gully."
80,"Starc to Brownlie, no run back of a length at 139.5 kph, this one didn't swing and angled across without giving Brownlie much room. He hacked it from the crease to point."

84,"Siddle to Vettori, no run short of a length and looking to push across Vettori, who hops back to defend to the off side."
85,"Siddle to Vettori, no run too straight, ends up outside leg and Vettori tries to cover the line and work it square, but can't get it away."
86,"Siddle to Vettori, no run beaten outside off by the perfect line. It landed outside leg and held its line as it angled across. Might have even nipped away a sliver. Vettori wasn't forward and was trying hard to cover the line, but missed."
87,"Siddle to Vettori, 3 runs over-pitched, and Vettori is ready to get the extra foot forward and drive. Neatly punched into the covers for a triple."
88,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run back of a length outside Brownlie's off stump and he shoulders arms."
89,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run good ball to end the over, this one bends away off the seam from short of a length and bounces extra too. Brownlie had to yank the bat away from the line after trying to cover it."
90,"Starc to Vettori, no run 138 kph and angling in towards the pads, Vettori tries working it square and it goes off the pads to the off side."
91,"Starc to Vettori, no run well bowled Mitch. Swings this one away, and quite sharply at 138 kph. Vettori was left feeling for it, but to his credit he stopped short of being squared up by the movement as it went away at a fair clip."
92,"Starc to Vettori, no run closer to driving length, Vettori leans out and lets go."
93,"Starc to Vettori, no run probes away outside off at 136 kph, Vettori gives it a good look and leaves."

95,"Starc to Brownlie, 1 run too short, Brownlie is ready and rolls the wrists efficiently on a pull to bring up the century-stand. How well have these two played!"
96,"Siddle to Brownlie, 3 runs even better from Brownlie, whose average continues to bloom. Over-pitched on off stump by Siddle, and he leans out to plant it straight back past the bowler for a triple. Great work from Pattinson (why isn't he bowling?) saves the fourth."
97,"Siddle to Vettori, no run angled across Dan at pace, he stays put on the stance and leaves."
98,"Siddle to Vettori, FOUR runs uppish, but safely past gully. Vettori went hard at this as it angled across outside off, and managed to get the edge safely between the slips and gully for four."

100,"Siddle to Vettori, no run 149 kph, Siddle is cranking it up now. Probes away on a good length outside off, and this time Vettori leaves."
101,"Siddle to Vettori, FOUR runs Vettori is seeing the ball well and early. Siddle's short ball sits up and asks to be punished, and Vettori dismisses it with a cracking short-arm jab masquerading as a pull. NZ are off to a flier again."
102,"Starc to Brownlie, no run Starc angles this one across the right hander, and Brownlie resist the urge to have a poke."
103,"Starc to Brownlie, no run back of a length, Brownlie hangs on the crease and blocks to the off side."
104,"Starc to Brownlie, FOUR runs spanked with trans-Tasman anger! Short and wide outside off, Brownlie stayed put beside the line and lashed it up and over point for four. That didn't take too long to reach the boundary."
105,"Starc to Brownlie, 1 run another half-stop worth mention from Pattinson. Over-pitched on off stump and Brownlie drives it really well through mid-off, Pattinson dives and saves the four."
106,"Starc to Vettori, no run whipped in outside off at 142.5 kph, Vettori lets it go."
107,"Starc to Vettori, 2 runs drama! Top-edge, safe. Risky second, safe. Short from Mitch, and this time he hustles Vettori for pace. He was late on the pull, from well wide of off stump, and ended up spading it up over the off side, in the air with the bat face pointing upwards. Three slips, gully and the keeper ran back for the catch, but it landed just out o"

133,"Lyon to Vettori, no run curves in and breaks away from a full length, Vettori presses across and lets it go."
134,"Lyon to Vettori, 2 runs Starc makes a mess of it running back from mid-on! Tossed up outside off, Vettori looks to slog-heave it over midwicket and top-edges it. Starc had it covered as he ran back, but seemed to stop and look over at Warner who was strolling from midwicket. Mistake. He ended up having to hurry back and dive, and could not even getting a h"

164,"Siddle to Brownlie, no run ripper from Sid Vicious. Hits the seam as it angles in and lands on a length, before rearing away violently. Brownlie had no chance of covering the line. The other DGB might have been good enough to edge it ..."

174,"Lyon to Vettori, OUT Suicide! Vettori has ended his stay. The bowlers couldn't get him, but he's run himself out. He's gutted. He was thinking of the ton there, pushed a full ball straight to Hussey at mid-off and set off. That went too quickly to Hussey, who pounced on it and let rip in one fluid motion. The stumps were messed up before Vettori could dive"

179,"Siddle to Young, OUT and that's the end of that. Young's come and gone in a flash. Siddle continues to hit that lovely length outside off and seam it away. This time Young jabs at it with hard hands and it has the legs to carry easily into Clarke's hands in the slips."

192,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run pitches this up and he plays a workman-like cover drive that doesn't pierce the covers."
193,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run tossed up outside off, pushed into the covers off the front foot"
194,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run that drift again, towards middle and leg, Brownlie covers the line and defends."
195,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run"
196,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run stays back to a full ball, but defends to the leg side."
197,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run where is leg gully when you need him? Brownlie fends at one that spins and bounces big from outside off. Hits the top of the bat and pops to the leg side behind square. No one's there to take it."
198,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run gets behind the line to safely negotiate the last ball."
199,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run back of a length and good carry on a pacy ball, and Bracewell lets it go to the keeper."
200,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run pitched up on off stump and Bracewell drives to mid-off."

202,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run short of a length outside off, forced from the crease into the off side."
203,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run angled in from a touch wider of the crease, and it straightens from a full length. Bracewell leaves it."
204,"Siddle to Bracewell, no run short ball banged in with purpose, but not short enough to be a bouncer. Bracewell hops back to defend to the leg side."
205,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run Lyon loops it up outside off and Brownlie punches to mid-on."
206,"Lyon to Brownlie, 1 run gets the single this time as Hussey at mid-on dives to his left to stop the ball."

208,"Lyon to Bracewell, no run Bracewell leans out to defend with bat and pad close together."
209,"Lyon to Bracewell, no run lets an arm ball outside off to go through to the keeper."
210,"Lyon to Bracewell, OUT how well has Lyon bowled on his first trip to this ground? Bracewell is gone, playing for the spin against a deceptive over-spinner and that's an 18-ball duck. Lyon tossed this up outside off and it goes on straight to skim the outside edge, straight into first slip's hand."
211,"Siddle to Brownlie, 3 runs back of a length outside off, and Brownlie lets out a fluent steer through backward point"
212,"Siddle to Southee, 2 runs on the pads, and he whips it with a flourish to open his account. Brisk running gets them a couple."
213,"Siddle to Southee, (no ball) 1 run Siddle over-steps and delivers back of a length outside off. Southee dabs into the covers for one."
214,"Siddle to Brownlie, 1 run 143 kph, and Brownlie's turn to steal a single. He stays back and pushes into the covers."
215,"Siddle to Southee, no run Southee misses a straight ball by a mile. 145 kph and well wide of off stump, Southee drives down a complete different highway."

217,"Lyon to Southee, no run flighted outside off, and Southee defends on the front foot to the leg side."
218,"Lyon to Southee, 2 runs Southee's sent this one into the clouds. Tossed up in the slot, Southee charges out and tees off straight up. Hussey runs back a mile from mid-on and nearly gets there before it lands inside the ropes."
219,"Lyon to Southee, 1 run drags a ball from outside off to the leg side for a single."
220,"Lyon to Brownlie, FOUR runs bash! Brownlie connects with a healthy clunk as he waltzes out, the ball isn't too full but it doesn't prevent him from crashing it through mid-on for four."

225,"Starc to Brownlie, 1 run short of a length outside off, chopped from the crease past point for a single."
226,"Starc to Southee, SIX runs Southee's killed that! That's the batsman's version of the round-house kick. Pitched up outside off, he plants the front foot towards the length and hoicks it right back past the bowler and all the way into the stands."
227,"Starc to Southee, 3 runs he's having a beefy go here. 143 kph, over-pitched. He drives it right out of the screws through the covers."

232,"Lyon to Southee, no run Southee tries to swipe one tossed up wide of off stump, but it misses the bat. And the stumps."
233,"Lyon to Southee, OUT and that's the end of Southee's hand. He skates out again and looks to take Lyon downtown, but mishits the loft. Hussey comes in from long-on on gobbles it. And then he shines the ball as he sprints in to celebrate with his mates! Mr. Cricket!"
234,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run Brownlie does all he can to pick a single as he skips out, but gets too close to the flight and plays it back to the bowler."
235,"Starc to Martin, no run and he unfurls a confident leave outside off. Length ball from Starc wide of off stump, and he lets it go."
236,"Starc to Martin, no run and another. Perfect leaving technique on display as Starc bends one across."
237,"Starc to Martin, no run he's seen enough. He has a go at a full ball outside off, but doesn't reach it. Not much footwork towards the pitch of the ball. He takes after Sehwag in that regard."
238,"Starc to Martin, no run short and wide outside off, Martin stays out of the line and swerves the bat inside the line."
239,"Starc to Martin, no run you could say he was beaten outside off. In reality, Starc is just relieved Martin didn't connect with a silken smooth steer through point as he felt for it."
240,"Starc to Martin, no run the cover drive now, and he middles thin air. The ball meanwhile proceeds unfettered on a different course, wide of off stump. Starc didn't make him play at all in that over. Appalling."
241,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run Brownlie stays back and defends a spinning ball back to the bowler."

243,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run tossed up on off stump, whipped to midwicket and Brownlie denbies the single."

245,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run tossed up outside off, he slaps it right back to the bowler."
246,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run Lyon does his bit - flat and straight at the body, Brownlie works it straight to midwicket."
247,"Starc to Martin, no run he keeps searching for these length balls outside off. Stays miles out of line and feels for it as Starc again keeps it outside off."
248,"Starc to Martin, 1 run the biggest roar so far in the game as Martin gets away! Starc finally gets the idea. Full ball on the stumps. I saw Martin's feet trembling when Starc was bowling at him. But that didn't stop him from squeezing it through midwicket for one."
249,"Starc to Brownlie, no run Brownlie tries to muscle a boundary or a two to the off side, but ends up denying the single after lashing a length ball into the covers."
250,"Starc to Brownlie, no run short ball now, smashed straight to deep square leg, and he stays put."
251,"Starc to Brownlie, 1 run gets the single now, backing away and steering a length ball into the covers. He's keeping Martin off strike too much, I wonder if that will affect the Phantom's fluency."
252,"Starc to Martin, no run Starc bowls the worst ball of the match so far. Pushes a short ball miles down the leg side. He keeps Martin off strike, if that was the plan."
253,"Lyon to Brownlie, no run Brownlie walks to gully and looks to lash Lyon with the turn over deep square leg, but misses. The ball slides down the leg side."
254,"Lyon to Brownlie, 1 run he takes the single now! Jumps out and looks to crash one through long-on, and finds the fielder, but he takes one."
255,"Lyon to Martin, no run textbook defence, forthright and forward, it hits the pad as it spins in."
256,"Lyon to Martin, no run he looks to push to the covers now, and it pops off the bat and pad to the off side."
257,"Lyon to Martin, OUT Martin's gone, but after he's got one run more in his latest innings than Don Bradman did. Classical offspinner's dismissal from a classical offspinner. Lyon tosses it up and spins it in sharply, drawing Marto forward on the push-drive and it easily finds the bat-pad gap."
258,"When Vettori was on, New Zealand looked set for 350, but 295 is not a bad job at all. Especially after being 90-odd for five. Australia found some late inspiration from Siddle, while Lyon was exemplary right through. Still, not a very memorable bowling effort from them. Now we can have a bit of Warner before lunch, and may be more of him after."

269,"Bracewell to Clarke, no run wide of the crease again, around a good length outside off, Clarke gets forward and shoulders arms"
270,"Bracewell to Clarke, no run dropped, Bracewell's unfortunate once again, that could have just taken the inside edge, the wicketkeeper Reece Young moved a touch too much to his left there and had to gather the ball to his right, fullish on the off and moved in, Clarke got forward to drive it towards cover, got an clear inside edge as Hot Spot confirmed but"
