0,"10.15am This series has certainly been a role reversal from last year with England dominating both contests so far and Australia desperately needing some inspiration. The visitors have a heap of injury problems, the latest being Nathan Hauritz who has flown home and Sha"
1,"Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 Tim Paine (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White, 6 Mike Hussey, 7 James Hopes, 8 Steven Smith, 9 Ryan Harris, 10 Doug Bollinger, 11 Shaun Tait"
2,"England 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Craig Kieswetter (wk), 3 Kevin Pietersen, 4 Paul Collingwood, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Luke Wright, 7 Tim Bresnan, 8 Michael Yardy, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson"
3,"10.20am So, here we go. England have won the toss and put Australia into bat. The home side are unchanged after Michael Yardy pulled up okay from his minor leg injury. Australia have made two changes, with Tait straight into the line-up and Ryan Harris back from his gro"
4,"10.44am Right, people. It's time to get going. James Anderson has the ball, on his home ground, Watto's on strike ..."
5,"Anderson to Watson, no run good length delivery, not a lot of nip, but calmly pushed to mid-on"
6,"Anderson to Watson, no run hurried on middle-and-leg stump, a bit of climb off the seam. Defended easily enough"
7,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs that's a statement of intent. A fraction too short from Anderson, and no great venom in the delivery. Watson rocks back and clobbers that through midwicket"
8,"Anderson to Watson, no run that's a good riposte. Yorker, and well dug out"
9,"Anderson to Watson, no run zipping off the seam, clatters the thigh pad as Watson aims to flick through square leg"
10,"Anderson to Watson, no run better line and length, drawing a solid defensive block on off stump"
11,"Bresnan to Paine, no run good ball, on off stump, full length"
12,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide a bit of a nothing delivery, slipping down leg"
13,"Bresnan to Paine, no run outside off, full length again, angled into the gully"
14,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs too full this time, an easy half-volley, and Paine punches coolly through long-off. Elegant"
15,"Bresnan to Paine, no run Bresnan responds by pulling his length back by half a yard. Blocked off the back foot"
16,"Bresnan to Paine, no run another lifter on off stump, angled into the gully"
17,"Bresnan to Paine, no run a touch of width, but no more than dabbed out to point. Another decent over"
18,"Anderson to Watson, no run outside off, no stroke offered this time"
19,"Anderson to Watson, no run that is a nut. Outside off, kicking off the turf, and just feinting past the edge. Good delivery"
20,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run dabbed down to third man, a decent line once again, but just enough width to open the face"
21,"Anderson to Paine, no run flicked off the hips to backward square"
22,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run the first out-and-out short ball of the game, and it's pulled without total control to deep square. Safe enough"
23,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run short, but without the same conviction, and Watson's pull is miscued to midwicket"
24,"Bresnan to Watson, no run outside off, through to the keeper"
25,"Bresnan to Watson, no run outside off again, and a loose nibble in response. Nearly an edge"
26,"Bresnan to Watson, no run a swished pull, but no contact. Loose again, and loud oohs as Kieswetter gathers"
27,"Bresnan to Watson, no run pushed back into the crease, and defended"
28,"Bresnan to Watson, no run right up in the blockhole, and lo and behold, it's blocked"
29,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs more kick off the turf, but that's misdirected, and helped calmly through backward square leg for another boundary"
30,"Anderson to Paine, no run drawn onto the front foot, blocked again"
31,"Anderson to Paine, no run tight line, good carry, left alone"
32,"Anderson to Paine, no run poked into the gully, sharp fielding and a threat of a shy keeps Paine in his crease"
33,"Anderson to Paine, no run bouncer, and a brisk one. No stroke offered on this occasion"
34,"Anderson to Paine, no run that's an ugly premeditated stroke. Gave himself room and aimed a wild swing through the covers. Anderson held his line and beat the edge"
35,"Anderson to Paine, no run off-stump lifter. Defended to bring to an end a tidy over"
36,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run open-faced glide down to third man. Effective use of the width"
37,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide banged in short, too short."
38,"Bresnan to Paine, no run forced back into the crease by a tight delivery, back of a length"
39,"Bresnan to Paine, no run Paine goes right back in his crease, and Bresnan follows him with a yorker. Good canny bowling"
40,"Bresnan to Paine, no run dabbed into the covers, and another dot ball piles up to keep Paine under the cosh"
41,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a good release of pressure. Not a bad delivery, but played firmly on the up, and through the covers"
42,"Bresnan to Paine, 1 run that's wild, and ugly. A smear over the covers, and he just clears Anderson running back. Bresnan is not impressed, and informs the batsman as such"
43,"Anderson to Paine, no run blocked. Tight bowling from Anderson, no width at all"
44,"Anderson to Paine, no run big inside-edge as Anderson nips one off the seam from a good length. Half an appeal"

46,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run third man is in business again as Watson flashes another single through the cordon"
47,"Anderson to Paine, 1 run another single to third man. Just a touch too wide from Anderson, but Australia can't capitalise"
48,"Anderson to Watson, no run a good finish to the over, a big offcutter, and it nearly worms its way through Watson's defences. Nearly, but not quite."
49,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a better stroke, as Bresnan serves up another rare half-volley. Good stride, full face, and there's no catching that"
50,"Bresnan to Paine, 2 runs back of a length, swished through point"
51,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a pie from Bresnan, short and wide, and Paine slams it gleefully through point. A costly over so far"
52,"Bresnan to Paine, no run better this time, tighter line, and respectfully defended"
53,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs down the track, lofted drive, good contact, and mid-on can't get close to that. A third four in five balls"
54,"Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs short, and swung away over fine leg. A hint of a top-edge, but they all count. An expensive over, but Paine is up and running, so too are Australia"
55,"Anderson to Watson, no run tight from Anderson, defended into the gully"
56,"Anderson to Watson, no run punched drive, tidied up by mid-on"
57,"Anderson to Watson, no run driven back to the bowler, full and straight from Anderson"

59,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run targeting the base of middle stump, but whipped wristily to midwicket for a quick single"
60,"Anderson to Paine, no run outside off, a hint of wobble through the air, defended to point. Another fine over from Anderson, who's been the pick of the attack this morning"
61,"Broad to Watson, no run full and straight, punched back down the pitch"
62,"Broad to Watson, 1 run chipped to mid-on, and a scampered single as the shy comes in. Home safe"
63,"Broad to Paine, FOUR runs short and leg-sided, it would have been wide if it had been left alone, but instead it was helped on its way by Paine, who is now flying"
64,"Broad to Paine, FOUR runs down the leg-side again, another four, much finer this time. Poor work from Broad"
65,"Broad to Paine, no run open-faced steer to point."

72,"Anderson to Paine, no run impeccable over, tight line and length, no liberties on offer"
73,"Wright to Watson, 1 run good start, full and straight, and defended"
74,"Wright to Paine, 1 run an ambitious swipe through the line, no timing in the shot, but enough bat to steal a single to mid-on"
75,"Wright to Watson, 2 runs a desperate gallop as Swann's shy comes in from fine leg. But he's safely home"
76,"Wright to Watson, no run full stride, and pushed up to cover"
77,"Wright to Watson, SIX runs slower ball, and that was picked straight from the hand. Watson drops to one knee and mows it over midwicket. Top tonking"
78,"Wright to Watson, FOUR runs strays onto the pads, and a tidy over is suddenly transformed into an expensive one. Fourteen off the over as that shot fizzes through the gap at wide mid-on"
79,"Broad to Paine, no run that one went like an offbreak, and nearly nipped out the off stump. Good delivery"
80,"Broad to Paine, FOUR runs too short, and that's spanked on the up through backward point. Australia are cooking now, and England need to think on their feet, as they did to good effect at Cardiff"
81,"Broad to Paine, no run fuller length, and defended to cover. That's a better length for this wicket"
82,"Broad to Paine, 1 wide poor bowling, speared down the leg-side"
83,"Broad to Paine, no run better line and length once again"
84,"Broad to Paine, 1 run tucked off the toes to square leg"
85,"Broad to Watson, no run inside-edged defence to bring an end to a mixed over"
86,"Yardy to Paine, no run looped onto a good length to launch his spell"
87,"Yardy to Paine, no run clipped coolly to midwicket"
88,"Yardy to Paine, OUT that is absolutely plumb! Paine steps back for a flick through midwicket, but is beaten by the angle from wide of the crease and nailed right in front of middle. That's the breakthrough, and not before time from England's point of view"
89,"Yardy to Ponting, no run wide of the crease again, and played watchfully"
90,"Yardy to Ponting, no run Collingwood comes in at silly point as Ponting drives"

92,"Broad to Ponting, no run right up in the blockhole, defended to mid-on"

94,"Broad to Ponting, no run this one nips back off the seam a fraction. Cautiously defended into the covers"
95,"Broad to Ponting, no run drilled into the covers, but can't pierce the field"
96,"Broad to Ponting, no run shorter, and Ponting attempts his signature pull, but he can't time that one"
97,"Broad to Ponting, no run full and straight, that's a tidy maiden of the Wag variety, or should I say, Fuf?"
98,"Yardy to Watson, no run outside off, chopped down to short third man"
99,"Yardy to Watson, no run very full from round the wicket, dug out down to mid on"
100,"Yardy to Watson, no run ooh, another appeal for lbw but this one is strangled as it's going down leg on the angle"

102,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run worked off leg stump stump past midwicket as he finally beats the field"
103,"Yardy to Ponting, no run outside off, leans forward in defence and pushed into the covers"
104,"Swann to Watson, 2 runs nicely done, waited for it and opened the face through short third man who makes a good chase and keeps them to two"
105,"Swann to Watson, FOUR runs same shot and more reward this time, a little too wide from Swann and it gives Watson the room to tab it fine through third man"
106,"Swann to Watson, 1 run straighter and Watson goes back to whip this through midwicket"
107,"Swann to Ponting, no run nicely bowled on off stump, Ponting comes forward and pushes to the leg side"
108,"Swann to Ponting, 1 run goes back and pushes through the covers"
109,"Swann to Watson, no run can't beat square leg this time as he turns this from the stumps...Swann just taking a little while to settle"

112,"Yardy to Ponting, 1 run dragged down very short and helped through the leg side out to deep square"
113,"Yardy to Watson, no run another short one, but it hurries onto Watson who has to be quick to pull it to midwicket"
114,"Yardy to Watson, no run defended out to midwicket"
115,"Yardy to Watson, SIX runs that goes all the way, too short and Watson had all the time in the world to wait on the back foot and pull it over deep midwicket...a good way for Australia to go to drinks"
116,"Swann to Ponting, no run worked from outside off into the leg side"
117,"Swann to Ponting, 1 wide, OUT gone! Huge wicket for England and great work from Kieswetter as this one spins sharply down the leg side, beating Ponting as he comes down the pitch and the wicketkeeper brings the ball back from very wide with the Aussie captain str"
118,"Swann to Clarke, no run comes forward on off stump and defends"
119,"Swann to Clarke, 3 runs too short outside off, Clarke uses the crease well and steps back to cut through point"

128,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run waiting on the back foot, cut through point out to the sweeper"
129,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run ooh, well bowled, went for a double bluff and pitched it up...Clarke's footwork not there and he gets a thick inside edge out to deep square"
130,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs handsome...floated up outside off stump, a slower ball and it's driven dismissively through cover. He loves that shot."
131,"Broad to Watson, 1 run punched down the ground to long-on and there's another fifty for Watson, this time from 54 balls. Now, can he convert one?"
132,"Broad to Clarke, 1 wide there we go, the expected bouncer, but it's too short and going down the leg side"
133,"Broad to Clarke, no run back of a length, Clarke hops back and defends into the off side"
134,"Broad to Clarke, no run he's not too comfortable with that one, goes for a pull and it takes his arm then into the body"
135,"Broad to Clarke, no run well bowled, but Clarke is easily behind it on his tip-toes and defends by his feet"
136,"Yardy to Watson, 1 wide fired way down the leg side"
137,"Yardy to Watson, no run chopped fine to short third man"

140,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run floated in on middle, punched with a straight bat down the ground"
141,"Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs works this off the stumps and he's placed it well between deep square and midwicket so it allows two"
142,"Yardy to Clarke, no run very full, dug out and fielded by the bowler in his follow through"
143,"Broad to Watson, 1 run that squares up Watson and takes the outside edge down to third man as he tries to play through the leg side"
144,"Broad to Clarke, 1 run short ball and pulled away with a mixture of a hook and a pull to find deep square"

148,"Broad to Clarke, no run back of a length, forced into the off side"
149,"Yardy to Watson, no run good fielding back the non-striker's stumps...that was drilled straight by Watson and crashed into the timbers. Saved four, and also saved umpire Ian Gould from having to get out of the firing line"

171,"Swann to Watson, 2 runs quicker this time and too straight, flicked out to deep square and he hurries back for a second"
172,"Swann to Watson, OUT gone! Swann makes another breakthrough and Watson again can't convert...he tries to turn this into the leg side, it all looks quite innocuous, but some extra bounce meant he just lobs a simple catch to square leg"

230,"Swann to Hussey, 1 run forward and blocked to cover"
231,"Swann to Clarke, no run forward and defended, back to the bowler"

261,"Yardy to Smith, 1 run touch too straight and helped into the big leg-side spaces again"
262,"Yardy to Hopes, no run excellent work in his follow through as Yardy dives full stretch to stop a well-timed drive"
263,"PD Collingwood to Smith, FOUR runs there's some aggression as this is heaved from off stump through the leg side and both midwicket and mid-on are inside the circle"
264,"PD Collingwood to Smith, 1 run dropped into the off side and well run"
265,"PD Collingwood to Hopes, 1 run no timing from Hopes as he tries to force off the back foot and it dribbles to long-on"

268,"PD Collingwood to Hopes, no run can't beat midwicket where captain Strauss makes a one-handed save"

270,"Anderson to Hopes, 2 runs back of a length, worked through deep midwicket and good running makes it into a couple...Australia's 200 is up"

272,"Anderson to Hopes, 1 run another good yorker, this time he manages to work it down to long-on"
273,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run stays full and pushed down the pitch, but Anderson fumbles the stop in his follow through and is very annoyed as it gives away a single"
274,"Anderson to Hopes, OUT gone! Anderson strikes with a slower ball which was back of a length and makes Hopes play the pull far too early, resulting in an under edge onto off stump...now it's down to the bowlers"
275,"Broad to Smith, 2 runs short and pulled away through midwicket"
276,"Broad to Smith, 1 run goes for the yorker, comes out a low full toss which is worked out to deep square"
277,"Broad to Harris, 1 run back of a length, pulled out to deep square who is quickly in from the boundary"
278,"Broad to Smith, 1 run connects well with this pull but it goes straight to deep midwicket"
279,"Broad to Harris, OUT and that's why it's all short, because it works, as Harris splices an attempted pull and lobs a simple catch Strauss at midwicket who has been in the action today"
280,"Broad to Bollinger, no run short on leg stump, takes Bollinger on the back side as he doesn't play a shot"
281,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run low full toss which is drilled down to long-on...England won't mind that"
282,"Anderson to Bollinger, 3 runs he goes over the covers and clears the in field, Luke Wright chases hard and a better throw could have had Bollinger in trouble as he came back for three"
283,"Anderson to Smith, no run brilliant yorker, Smith tried to give himself room but was followed by Anderson"

285,"Anderson to Tait, 1 run good yorker, dug out towards the keeper and they scamper a single"
286,"Anderson to Bollinger, OUT all over! Dead-eye yorker from Anderson as Bollinger backs away to try and go through the off side and the ball strikes bottom of middle. That is that."
287,"Brilliant stuff from England who fought back superbly after Watson and Paine added 75. The spinners, led by Swann, were outstanding backed up by Michael Yardy while James Anderson did the late damage. Australia are a side low on confidence and will need a huge effort to"
288,"Ricky Ponting, who's close to suffering a rather terminal sense-of-humour failure on this trip, has just given his team a bit of a rollicking in their huddle. Here come England's openers, Andrew Strauss and Craig Kieswetter ... and it will be Shaun Tait to bowl the firs"
289,"Meanwhile, how's this for a premonition of traumas to come. Germany victorious as England are undermined by penalties. And the Aussies, well they crashed out long ago. Yes, I'm talking about the European Grand Prix, which is live on ESPNF1 right now ..."
290,"Welcome back. Andrew Miller here for the start of England's run-chase. They need 213 and ... well, it should be a regulation victory given how well they've played of late. But you know what they say about assumptions."
291,"Tait to Strauss, no run rapid first delivery, outside off, and no stroke offered. Tidy and threatening start"

293,"Tait to Strauss, 1 run width, and toe-ended down to third man to get Strauss off the mark"
294,"Tait to Pietersen, no run another yorker-length delivery, but outside off this time. Prodded away uncertainly. 96.7mph, apparently!"

299,"Bollinger to Strauss, 3 runs driven firmly into the covers, Ponting takes the pace off with his fingertips, before Steven Smith hauls it back in with an insanely committed head-first dive. Lucky there wasn't a speaker in the way of that effort"

303,"Tait to Pietersen, no run slower ball, and Pietersen punches that back to the bowler"

315,"Harris to Strauss, no run nice start, bursting past the edge with good carry. Nearly the breakthrough"

323,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run short, and Strauss sways out of the way"

337,"Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run a touch of width, angled out to point"
338,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run angled delivery, strikes the pad but always going over. Strauss thinks about a single but is rightly sent back"
339,"Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs banged in short, and with fine leg up, Pietersen was never going to miss out on that. Even with fine leg back he'd have climbed into it! And Harris is annoyed with himself"

341,"Harris to Pietersen, no run nippy delivery, and Pietersen is nipped in the bud! That's gotta hurt ... and sure enough it does ... he's down and taking a breather. The physio is out, but as David Lloyd points out, what exactly can he do? Give him a rub?"

373,"Clarke to Strauss, 2 runs on the pads, flicked fine, Harris chases and intercepts with a slide"

513,"Tait to Morgan, 1 run slower one, but he's picked it and drops the ball to cover for a sharp single. Good call, Strauss called him through straight away"

515,"Tait to Morgan, no run shorter this time, Morgan taps to cover off the back foot, the ball going too quickly to the fielder for any thought of another quick single"
516,"Hopes to Strauss, no run tapped to mid off"
517,"Hopes to Strauss, no run misses off stump by a whisker! That wasn't too short but Strauss was back into an expansive pull. He was beaten on the under edge and the ball whizzed just past the stumps"

522,"Tait to Strauss, (no ball) ooh, that could've been nasty! This one slips out of the hand and ends up a beamer, but way outside off. Tait raises his hand in apology"

526,"Tait to Morgan, no run much fuller this time, Morgan is rushed somewhat in the drive, and the ball rolls to cover"
527,"Tait to Morgan, no run beaten for pace on the pull this time. Again, it wasn't too short but it got up to chest height. Morgan went for the pull but the ball was on to him too quickly and squirted off the toe of the bat to the off side"

556,"Smith to Yardy, no run worked with the spin out to midwicket"
557,"Tait to Bresnan, 1 run wow, almost strikes with a fearsome short ball that leaps at Bresnan, takes the shoulder of the bat but falls just out of reach of a diving backward point"

561,"Tait to Swann, 1 bye play and miss outside off, a full ball swings past Swann's drive and Paine can't gather cleaning...Swann only realises late on there's a bye to be taken"
562,"Bollinger to Swann, (no ball) 1 run full outside off, driven square down to third man...and Ponting had too many men outside the circle so it's a no-ball, too, but no free hit"

566,"Bollinger to Bresnan, 1 run width outside off and driven hard down to third man"

568,"Bollinger to Bresnan, no run flicked from middle stump down to mid on"
569,"Tait to Swann, no run down the leg side, Swann goes for a pull but doesn't make contact but it's not called wide"

574,"Tait to Swann, 1 leg bye on a length, takes the thigh pad into square leg and Swann keeps the strike"

585,"Hopes to Bresnan, FOUR runs he's done it...leans back and scythes an edge through the vacant third man area, past the man inside the circle. England celebrate as they secure the series but, boy, they made it tough"
586,"England 3 Australia 0. It's not a football score (England would never score that many) and it means the series is in the bag for Andrew Strauss which, despite today's major wobble, is a notable achievement for this evolving one-day side. Credit to Australia, they gave i"
