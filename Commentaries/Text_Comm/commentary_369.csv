0,"Khan to Wade, 1 wide that wasn't too far from being a wide. Back of a length, well outside off stump and it them seams away prodigiously. Ah it was called a wide after all."
1,"Khan to Wade, no run short of a length outside off stump, Wade stays back and defends to the off side."
2,"Khan to Wade, 2 runs dropped by Rohit Sharma at first slip. And the reason for the drop was that Rohit was positioned at second slip. This would have been a regulation take for Tendulkar to his left at first slip, but Rohit came flying across in front of him for a one-handed take. He gets h"

13,"Khan to Wade, 1 wide no confusion this time. Another big wide from Zaheer, and Davis call is there for all to see."
14,"Khan to Wade, no run he gets his outside edge again. Wade just seemed to be defending inside the line there, and the ball popped softly off the outer half, on the bounce to Tendulkar at first slip."
15,"Khan to Wade, no run short of a length, wide of off stump and he lets it go."
16,"Khan to Wade, no run goes a touch fuller and gets the ball to straighten from wide of off stump. Impressive carry for Zaheer as Wade shoulders arms."

21,"Vinay to Warner, no run gets good connection on the punchy cut this time, but finds point."
22,"Vinay to Warner, no run electric from Kohli. This is the best Indian fielding side of all-time. Short ball outside off to Warner, who crashes it behind square and Kohli goes horizontal to his right at point to cut it off. Four runs saved."

32,"Vinay to Wade, no run Wade looks to wallop Vinay up and over the off side, but there's just no width to work with, and he misses it completely. Strange choice of shot."

37,"Vinay to Warner, 3 runs Warner's fore-arms to the .. well.. fore. Back of a length outside off stump, angling in to cramp a normal batsman, but Warner's far from normal. He manages to power it away through the covers with a vicious jab and picks up three more."
38,"Khan to Warner, no run Jadeja's turn to dazzle at point. India cut off another four. Horror ball from Zaheer, hopelessly wide of off stump and it would have been called. Warner tries to thrash it behind point, but Jadeja's dive intervenes."
39,"Khan to Warner, no run width again, Warner thumps it powerfully into the covers, but straight to Raina."
40,"Khan to Warner, 1 run Wade responds late to Warner's call for a single after he pushed it to mid-off, but no hard done. They get the single easily."

43,"Khan to Wade, 3 leg byes another quiet turn to the leg side gets Wade a single. Aha, Vinay hits the stumps from fine leg, and the ricochet gets Australia an overthrow. It went off the pad to begin with. Did I get anything right there?"

50,"Khan to Warner, no run comes in with the angle, and Warner's attempt to work it to the leg side ends up in a tangle. It hits the pad, but it was going down the leg side."
51,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs Warner will pinch himself to confirm that he has indeed got a four away through the off side. Zaheer gives him miles of width outside off and Warner does well to reach it. In fact it went off the toe end of the bat and flew between cover and point."
52,"Khan to Warner, no run better line and length, Warner defends into the off side."
53,"Khan to Warner, FOUR runs Zaheer's poor start continues. Over-pitched on off stump now, and Warner's shifting into gear rampantly now. Sets himself up beside the line, gets under the ball and trumpets it through the covers with a rasping drive."
54,"Khan to Warner, SIX runs shot of the afternoon! Warner's yorked the boundary skirting at long-on with a rousing pick-up punch. Friendly length ball from Zaheer, who isn't moving the ball about anymore and Warner's thumped it rather disdainfully. Jabbed through the line, and he holds the pos"
55,"Khan to Warner, no run full again, Warner looks to get forward and is a touch late on the check drive to the off side. Super over this for Aus."
56,"Vinay to Wade, FOUR runs Zaheer Khan goes down at third man with the grace of a Bollywood actor in an action scene, on the stunt double's off day. Width to Wade wide of off stump, and he cracks it square. Zaheer had a long way to run, and then went down like a crumbling building, but the ba"
57,"Vinay to Wade, no run"
58,"Vinay to Wade, 1 run on the pads, Wade tucks it square, and Jadeja nearly catches Warner napping with a quick pick up and throw, but he misses. Warner's in, and the 50 is up."
59,"Vinay to Warner, no run over-pitched just outside off stump, Warner tries to clatter it through the off side, but misses. This pitch is much flatter than the first few overs suggested."

61,"Vinay to Warner, 1 run short of a length outside off, Warner pushes to cover and gets a single."

65,"Pathan to Warner, no run similar ball, Warner stays in the crease and plays it to the leg side with the angle."

75,"Pathan to Warner, FOUR runs Warner is looking ominous. Another length ball that does nothing off the straight, on off stump. Warner leans out and lofts it up and over mid-off quite easily. Problems for India."

229,"Khan to Hussey, 1 run Dropped Hussey chips down the pitch and tries to smash that over mid-off, Yadav had it covered, tried to cup it over his head and the ball slipped out, there was an outside chance of him taking it on the rebound if his reflexes were a bit better, that's the 50 stand"

243,"Pathan to Hussey, 1 wide"
244,"Pathan to Hussey, 2 byes Irfan totally lost control of that slower ball there! Tried to release it using his wrists like Murali, too wide outside the off stump"

247,"Yadav to Hussey, FOUR runs he's gifted a half volley on the pads and he moves across and clips it down to fine leg, used the pace of the ball there"

251,"Yadav to Hussey, 1 run punches it to the off side for an easy single"

257,"Khan to Hussey, no run squirts out a yorker outside the off stump and Kohli fields at point"
258,"Khan to Hussey, 1 run had to scramble there, Hussey mistimed the pull down to mid-on and decided to risk a single to Jadeja, dives but a direct hit would have sent him back"
259,"Khan to Forrest, 1 run full on leg and he punches it down to long-on"
260,"Vinay to Christian, 1 wide he foxes Christian with a slower ball and he's still penalised for height, seemed a bit harsh at first considering the batsman was down the track"
261,"Vinay to Christian, FOUR runs smashes that one down the ground, Christian comes down the track and hammers a length ball over the bowler's head"
262,"Vinay to Christian, FOUR runs and again! Fuller delivery on the pads and he whams that so hard down the ground that long-on had no chance, brute power"

269,"Pathan to Hussey, no run near-perfect yorker again, goes between his legs and he nearly loses balance at the crease"
270,"Pathan to Hussey, FOUR runs the slower ball and Christian picks it early and hoicks it over midwicket, the fielder in the deep may have been a bit too forward"

272,"Pathan to Hussey, 4 leg byes goes past Dhoni! Yorker on the pads, he makes room and the ball clips his pads, sneaks past the stumps and Dhoni moved to the wrong side, it evaded him and raced to third man"
273,Looks like Dhoni will have to come up with something special again. Let's see how fit Tendulkar is. Join us soon.
274,Over 100 runs off the last ten overs and it was in contrast to the previous game at Adelaide where the Indians choked the Australians at the death overs. Dan Christian was in blazing form and his blitz has given Australia a very good score. We've seen how unpredictable India can be with the bat.
275,"Welcome back. We're about five minutes away from the chase. Loud cheers as Tendulkar walks out. His shin's fine. Just watching the action from the T20 in New Zealand. India wouldn't mind batting there now, chasing this target at that stamp-sized ground in Hamilton."

285,"Lee to Gambhir, OUT Lee has got rid of the in-form man! Peach of a delivery on the corridor outside the off stump, Gambhir was tentative on the defense, didn't move his feet across and he was beaten for a bit of extra pace too, thin edge taken by Wade"

300,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run he tries to create a scoring opportunity by giving room but he steers it down to point"
301,"Lee to Tendulkar, no run There's an appeal for a catch to mid-on and the umpire Davis perhaps reckoned that hit his helmet, in fact he was right, it was a brute of a delivery that kicked up and balooned off the helmet and mid-on (Doherty) ran forward and took it, Davis was not interested, a"

303,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run"

305,"Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, OUT Doherty again! But this time he hangs on to it easily! Tendulkar arches backward to a short delivery to play one of his signature shots - the upper cut over the slips and third man - didn't get the elevation and Doherty at third man barely had to move"

341,"Hilfenhaus to Kohli, OUT Appeal for a catch at slip, Kohli isn't sure if that carried to David Hussey at slip, outside edge travels low to Hussey's right and the catcher was certain he took it cleanly, the umpires have a chat and refer it upstairs, from the square leg angle it looked alrig"
