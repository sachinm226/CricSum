0,"49.4;1;Tuffey to Hayden, 1 run full toss outside off stump, he swings a one-handed shot on that and will only get one to midwicket;"
1,"Hayden's good innings has carried Australia to 346. He was sluggish, had a couple close calls in the field, but smoked some super dingers and has batted all through the innings, despite injury to the foot, to take his side to a very competitive total. I was going to add another 'very' in there but then we've seen, in this series and last year's version, how New Zealand have chased down totals close to this. I will reiterate again just how"
2,29 from 24. Tait and Bracken will bowl out. Here's the former.
3,"Tait to McCullum, 2 runs biffed! Full and straight, McCullum clears the leg and drives straight down the ground, long-off and long-on converge but the batsmen get two anyways, great running"
4,"Tait to McCullum, 1 run overpitched outside off stump, room on offer, McCullum hits that very hard down to Hogg at long-off, who gets down and fields well"
5,"Tait to Gillespie, FOUR runs Gillespie you beauty! This one is full and moving into leg stump, Gillespie backs away and squirts the bat at it, and gets another four courtesy the french cut"
6,"Tait to Gillespie, 2 runs fast and full, speared into leg stump, he shuffles and nudges it into the gap at midwicket and thats some terrific running"
7,"Tait to Gillespie, 1 run attempted yorker on off stump, he makes room and exposes the stumps, and then jams the bat down to steer it down to third man...Gillespie!"
8,"Tait to McCullum, 1 run overpitched outside off stump, McCullum leans into it and drives out to cover sweeper for the single...Seddon Park is alive"
9,"Bracken to McCullum, no run good ball! Zeroed in on middle and off and McCullum can only dig it out back to Bracken...well bowled"
10,"Bracken to McCullum, 1 run full on middle and leg, he uses the feet to flick to mid-on for one...he sure trusts Gillespie"
11,"Bracken to Gillespie, 2 runs full on middle and leg, and he plays a very good-looking flick, proper roll of the wrists et al, and gets an easy two out to deep midwicket"
12,"Bracken to Gillespie, 2 runs slower ball on off stump, now he's just messing with all of us is Gillespie, as he gets over it and flicks over square leg for a couple more"
13,"Bracken to Gillespie, no run good ball again, well done, great length outside off stump and it beats Gillespie's attempted slash"

19,"Tait to McCullum, 1 run full in the blockhole, McCullum looks to club it, mistimes it to the off side, sets off, Tait and cover swoop in and fire a throw but McCullum is safe"
20,"Bracken to McCullum, SIX runs would you believe it? Bracken! He bowls a knee-high full toss on the stumps and McCullum slams that superbly over deep fine leg for half a dozen! What a game this is!"
21,"Bracken to McCullum, no run full and he drives that back to the bowler"
22,"Bracken to McCullum, FOUR runs thats four, and New Zealand have whitewashed, blackwashed, whatever you wanna call it - they've beaten Australia 3-0! McCullum slashes another low full toss, one-handed, smack in the gap behind backward point and since everyone was up, that ball was destined for the ropes!"
23,"Well, thats all we have for you. This was the last official ODI ahead of that little tournament the ICC have lined up next month. We will definitely see you there. This is Jamie Alter signing off with a hearty cheers until the World Cup!"
24,So New Zealand sweep the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee Series.
25,"For those interested in stats, today's match had 26 sixes - yes, 26 - to equal the record set during that 438 match at Johannesburg last year."
26,"Spare a though for Mike Hussey, who hasnt won a game as captain. He had a depleted side, but then like they say, you put your best team forward. New Zealand too were without their two best bowlers, Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori, and it showed as Matthew Hayden led a fine onslaught to carry Australia to 346. He carried his bat, and braved a fractured foot to score an unbeaten 181, the highest score by an Australian. Unfortunately, he didnt"
27,"McMillan....well, he needs a special mention. From 41 for 4, with the solid Peter Fulton for support to begin with, he slammed the fastest ODI hundred by a New Zealander. He showed his belligerence in the CB Series and in the last match, but today he took it up a notch and then some. A fabulous innings from him, a day he wont forget any time soon. McMillan, Fulton, McCullum and that man Mark Gillespie, who kept everyone on their toes with"
28,"I need a breather and a nice stiff drink. Wow. If you thought the last match was a humdinger, well I'll tell you, this was something else. Bracken just lost the plot in the last over, offering a bleeding full toss to McCullum, a man whose reputation as a last-ditch scrapper has skyrocketed. What an innings he played, an unbeaten 86 from 91 deliveries, partnering the never-say-die McMillan in the partnership of the match."
29,New Zealand won by 1 wicket (with 3 balls remaining)
30,"Player of the match is Matthew Hayden, AUS"
