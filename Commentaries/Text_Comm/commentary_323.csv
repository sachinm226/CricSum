236,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs connects finally! The length was getting predictable, he stayed back and clubbed it over deep midwicket"
237,"Pollard to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs back to back sixes! Funny old over, short and he stays back and connects well again over deep midwicket. If only he connected the first four balls just as well"
238,"Best to McKay, 1 run fires that full and he digs it out down to mid-off and sets off, the throw to the keeper was a bit wide"
239,"Best to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide this was a really quick bouncer and inches over the helmet, Reiffel calls it a wide"
240,"Best to Coulter-Nile, 1 run makes room and gets an under edge to the keeper, they scamper the single"
241,"Best to McKay, 2 runs Dropped. shouldn't really matter at this stage, makes room and tries to clear midwicket, Narine runs back and spills it"
242,"Best to McKay, 1 bye down the leg side and nearly clips the pads as he tries to clip it away"
243,"Best to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye moves right across and tries to pull and the ball hits the pads and dribbles away"
244,"Best to McKay, no run full toss to end the game, it was quick and towards the pads and McKay made room and failed to connect, eye contact between the batsman and bowler but they shake hands, they're laughing about it now"
