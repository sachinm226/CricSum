0,"England win the toss and bat first. Well done them. No news of Australia's team yet. The big winners are keeping it close to their chests. Ah, here they are. Well it's what we expected really. Just Brad Hodge coming in for the when-will-he-ever-not-be-injured Shane Watson."
1,"Bracken to Bell, 2 runs Bell takes a step down the pitch, arrogantly so, and strokes him through the covers. There's some gumption"
2,"Bracken to Bell, no run a better line from Bracken this time on middle stump and fuller, drawing Bell forward. He does come forward, and defends"
3,"Bracken to Bell, no run and again it's defended on the front foot by Bell"
4,"Bracken to Bell, no run good, nagging line from Bracken here, just short of a length and wide enough for Bell to leave - but there's a touch of shape back into the right hander here"
5,"Bracken to Bell, no run cut off the back foot, with pleasing timing, straight down into the ground and straight to Clarke at point"
6,"Bracken to Bell, no run excellent line and length with which to finish the over, Bell defending it with nervous-like energy, prodding it down and skipping down the pitch - threatening to run. But he doesn't"
7,"Tait to Vaughan, no run ooh quick! Zippy, nasty delivery first up for Vaughan, this one rising on him. He shouldered arms, but the ball followed him - as though magnetised to his neck - and it flew through to Gilchrist"
8,"Tait to Vaughan, 1 run but Vaughan's off the mark here, as Tait sends down one a touch fuller which Vaughan, although on the back foot, angles it down past gully and screams Bell through for a single"
9,"Tait to Bell, no run well bowled again, 91 mph (146kph), rising on Bell who, like Vaughan, leaves alone. The ball died on Gilchrist there"
10,"Tait to Bell, 1 run clunked into the covers on the front foot"
11,"Tait to Vaughan, no run really testing line from Tait here, just outside off stump and Vaughan watches it sail by - though is watchful of where his off stump is"
12,"Tait to Vaughan, no run yorker-length but off target, just wide enough of Vaughan's off stump and he clamps down on it"
13,"Bracken to Bell, no run too wide and it's easily left alone"
14,"Bracken to Bell, no run Bell advances again, almost making it into a half volley, but Bell doesn't make anything of it, just punching it feebly into the covers"
15,"Bracken to Bell, 1 run nicely, elegantly cut off the back foot. I like to call that a Test cut. England need some one-day savagery in the first 15 overs"
16,"Bracken to Vaughan, FOUR runs ooh edged! Close! Vaughan takes a Bell-like step down the pitch, and gets a thick outside edge. Some might say he angled it on purpose. I, on the other hand, think he didn't"
17,"Bracken to Vaughan, no run but it's a bit too wide and left alone this time"
18,"Bracken to Vaughan, no run excellent end to the over, cutting this back into Vaughan who is watchful in defence"
19,"Tait to Bell, 1 leg bye a Tait slingshot down the leg side - almost Malinga-like there - and it wibbles off Bell's pad down to fine leg"
20,"Tait to Vaughan, OUT gone! Again short from Tait, Vaughan went back and simply played it onto his stumps."
21,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide another bouncer - and, rejoice, it's wided by the umpire."
22,"Tait to Strauss, no run on leg stump, short of a length, and Strauss punches it off his hip"
23,"Tait to Strauss, 3 runs oh yes, lovely shot from Strauss just driving it crisply through extra cover. It beats Hodge who sets off in pursuit and hauls it down"
24,"Tait to Bell, no run big, big shout from Tait who does a war dance in front of the umpire. Billy Bowden is utterly unimpressed, by both the appeal and the dance - that was miles, miles down the leg side and Bowden shakes his head"
25,"Tait to Bell, no run on off stump, Bell is forward in defence"
26,"Bracken to Strauss, no run firmly forward, Strauss blocks this out to cover"
27,"Bracken to Strauss, no run good movement from Strauss, confidently forward again and driving this with a crisp flourish - but he can't time it and it bobbles out into the off side"
28,"Bracken to Strauss, no run Strauss isn't tempted by a wide one - I would've been - and leaves it well alone"
29,"Bracken to Strauss, 2 runs neatly struck, looking to drive it straight but he opens the face of his bat at the last moment, cracking it behind square"
30,"Bracken to Strauss, no run full, straight, defended. Nothing more, nothing less"
31,"Bracken to Strauss, 2 runs edged, but it falls short of where second slip wasn't. And down to third man it flies - but Tait does fantastically well down there, diving to his right to prevent four"
32,"Tait to Bell, FOUR runs crashed back past the bowler for four. Fabulous shot really, just leaning on it and timing it quite beautifully"
33,"Tait to Bell, no run Bell is back and across, defending this with a high left elbow"
34,"Tait to Bell, no run too short and wide - left alone by Bell but, well, it's another dot ball"
35,"Tait to Strauss, no run on leg stump, again quick - the perfect delivery to the right-hander, actually - but it rams into Strauss's pads and he can't make anything of it"
36,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide the first genuinely filthy wide from Tait and Gilchrist, well - he does brilliantly to save four (or rather, five), diving to his right"
37,"Tait to Strauss, OUT gone! A mirror of Vaughan's dismissal"
38,"Bracken to Bell, no run again Bell advances down the pitch with impressive intent, but can't actually make anything of the ball. It bobbles out onto the leg side with meek intent"
39,"Bracken to Bell, no run defended out into the covers. No charge from Bell"
40,"Bracken to Bell, no run full, just on off stump, Bell charges and strokes him to mid-off. But straight to mid-off and again there's no run"
41,"Bracken to Bell, no run angled down just past Hayden at first slip - who does brilliantly, leaping to his right like the salmon he is not"
42,"Bracken to Bell, no run it's full, it's straight, it's defended on the back foot"
43,"Bracken to Bell, no run terrific bowling this from Bracken, it really is. And with Gilchrist up to the stumps, Bell is trapped - he just can't get it away. Pushed back to the bowler"
44,"Tait to Pietersen, no run on off stump, firmly cracked back to Tait who fields in his follow-through, the momentum - and his own fleet-footedness - carries him within a metre or so of Pietersen, staring him down. Pietersen stares him back"
45,"Tait to Pietersen, no run on leg stump this time and Pietersen turns it to square leg"
46,"Tait to Pietersen, (no ball) FOUR runs what a fabulous shot. That is quite brilliant, just punching it straight back past Tait. An on-drive of fierce power"
47,"Tait to Pietersen, no run and Pietersen goes for an expansive crash through the covers but misses out, clunking it straight to cover"
48,"Tait to Pietersen, no run and again he crashes, but gets a thick inside edge into his boot"
49,"Tait to Pietersen, no run Tait rather loses his line here, Pietersen just clipping him off his hip"
50,"Tait to Pietersen, no run defended on the back foot"
51,"Bracken to Bell, no run just short of a length but Bell can't break cover"
52,"Bracken to Bell, no run cracked on the front foot to cover. But straight to cover"
53,"Bracken to Bell, 1 wide down the leg side, Gilchrist takes it brilliantly but can't save Rudi calling it a wide"
54,"Bracken to Bell, no run Bell has absolutely hammered this, square, but straight to Ponting at what can only be described as a very short point. Superbly fielded"
55,"Bracken to Bell, 1 run guided off the back foot past the short Ponting at short point"
56,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run a bit of a heave there from Bracken. Bless him, he's getting tired. Pietersen nudges it off his hip"
57,"McGrath to Bell, 2 runs Bell runs down the pitch at a 100 mph and cracks him over midwicket - a short, slow delivery which Bell spoons over midwicket"
58,"McGrath to Bell, no run Bell defends on the back foot"
59,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs shot. Not quite as well timed as he'd like, but he lofts it neatly over mid-off"
60,"McGrath to Bell, 2 runs neatly back-cut past point - in fact, in front of point, in front of square"
61,"McGrath to Bell, no run McGrath-line-and-length, on off stump and it's defended with fierce caution"
62,"McGrath to Bell, no run nudged off his hip to end the over"
63,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run tidy start for Clarke, round the wicket to the righthander, and Pietersen has to defend that one"
64,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run groaned up there again, on the spot, and again Pietersen can only defend"
65,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run a touch shorter this time and that's patient from the big man, who strides into the ball and times a soft-handed drive to mid-off"
66,"Clarke to Bell, no run touch of bounce here and that's just defended down on the back foot, without too much fuss"
67,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run drags it short and there's a premeditated sweep, on one knee, round to fine leg"
68,"Clarke to Pietersen, 2 runs another sweep, this one in front of square, and there's a fine piece of sweeping from the sweeper/boundary rider* (*delete according to preference)"
69,"McGrath to Bell, no run on the spot outside off and that's defended forward"
70,"McGrath to Bell, no run drags it a touch short and Bell opens up his arms, ready to drive through covers, doesn't get hold of it quite right and an edge crashes forward into the ground"
71,"McGrath to Bell, no run this one's a quiet defence"
72,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run a touch of room outside off again and Bell waits to play a just-a-shade-late cut through gully and the pair set off immediately"
73,"McGrath to Pietersen, FOUR runs Pietersen comes down the track and McGrath can't adjust in time, Pietersen whipping that strongly off his legs in front of midwicket"
74,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run bouncer, of course, and Pietersen stands tall as he can - which is pretty tall - to pull that off one leg to midwicket. Oh, he didn't get hold of it, but he did wrap his tongue around a few words and McGrath's giving it back."
75,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run driven softly off the back foot back to mid-off"
76,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run outside off and Pietersen lets that one carry through to Gilchrist"
77,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run another one skids through to the keeper just outside the off stump"
78,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run turns right back in from outside off and Pietersen's stride probably saves him"
79,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run defended this time"
80,"McGrath to Bell, no run McGrath nearly gets Bell there, Bell opening the face and just failing to get a tickle on the way through to Gilchrist. Bell has to lean on his bat, like a crutch for an old man, to compose himself"
81,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs hits through the line and that's a really decent shot from Bell, lifting that over cover"
82,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs two fours on the bounce - outside off again and that's a really great square drive, perfect timing, the sort of shot that when you nail it you know has gone the second you connect"
83,"McGrath to Bell, no run on a better line and length, Bell takes the power of it, working to covers, but he's still looking hungry every ball"
84,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs ah, hello, another sweet drive from Bell, this time he decides to lean into the ball and drive it wide of mid-off - a rocket"
85,"McGrath to Bell, no run more width outside off and Bell growls as he fails to give it the treatment through point, instead lashing it into the ground"
86,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is indeed getting impatient - going to sweep that, and missing"
87,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run he connects on the sweep this time, that one in front of square"
88,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run and another sweep"
89,"Clarke to Pietersen, FOUR runs this time Pietersen takes his usual two strides down and plays that one one-legged, on the front foot, and that's driven literally on the front foot through long-on"
90,"Clarke to Pietersen, SIX runs that's big! Short ball which Pietersen scoops that off the bottom of the bat and sends it high and travelling"
91,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run short again, this one outside off and Pietersen cheekily takes it from outside the sticks and sweeps it right over in front of square"
92,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run over the wicket, spears that one in outside leg, it turns back in and Pietersen swishes it back out off the back foot"
93,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run outside the line again, Pietersen on one knee and that's an easy sweep in front of square"
94,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run another sweep, finds the gap this time and they get the single"
95,"Hogg to Bell, no run right up there, straight, and there's a loud, but solo, shout from the bowler as the batsman defends"
96,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run driven out to mid-off this time, but straight to the man there"
97,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run up there and there's a sweep in front of square. They think about coming back for two and decide against it"
98,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run stepped down and swept that one from outside off round in front of square, really using the angles well"
99,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run quicker ball, but the batsman is up to the task, working it away to point"
100,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run width on that one, but Pietersen doesn't make the most, slamming it into the ground on the off side, not timing it at all"
101,"Clarke to Pietersen, FOUR runs got hold of it this time with a well-struck pull and Mr Hussey on the boundary can't cut it off despite his Superman-like dive"
102,"Clarke to Pietersen, 2 runs swept round really fine and there's an immediate call for two, the batsmen getting back comfortably"
103,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run sweep shot, just for the single this time - it's easily picked up"
104,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run right up there, tidy delivery and that's worked to short midwicket"
105,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run bit of loop on that one, not connected with properly, Pietersen struggling to get over it as much as anything, and that's driven back forward"
106,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs swept past Tait"
107,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run on one knee but doesn't get properly engaged, that one just dribbling out to square"
108,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run full toss, but again it's at an awkward height"
109,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run worked away off the toes to midwicket"
110,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run straight and that's driven out to long-on"
111,"Symonds to Bell, no run on the money, pitching on off, and Bell can only defend that one on his back foot"
112,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run strays on to leg and there's a quick single, Ponting have a shy at the stumps as Bell just drops that one into the short midwicket region"
113,"Symonds to Pietersen, 2 runs cheeky sweep, on one knee and sending it aerial, but safe, and taking on Hogg's arm with the second"
114,"Symonds to Pietersen, no run Pietersen doesn't get hold of that one which comes in at him on the off, fuller than he was expecting, and he defends"
115,"Symonds to Pietersen, FOUR runs this time Pietersen backed away showing all three sticks even before the ball had been bowled, and he smashes that one through the gap between mid-off and cover and it fair races away"
116,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run straight and that's paddled away square to bring up England's 100 in the 20th over"
117,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run a play and a miss this time, the ball pitching outside off and just going straight on, nearly taking the edge"
118,"Hogg to Bell, no run driven to mid-on this time"
119,"Hogg to Bell, no run worked into the covers this time"
120,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run drifting down leg and worked further to leg"
121,"Symonds to Bell, no run pushed back to Symonds and his massive hair"
122,"Symonds to Bell, 2 runs too short, pulled by Bell but Hodge does well out on the deep square leg boundary, saving four"
123,"Symonds to Bell, 2 runs delicately clipped through midwicket, aerially, for two"
124,"Symonds to Bell, no run too straight from Symonds but Bell can't pierce the gap at cover, just nudging it off his hip"
125,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run very neatly defended on the back foot, timing it well enough to earn him a single"
126,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run the wrong line from Hogg, outside his leg stump and Bell just turns it to leg"
127,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run again wide of the leg stump, Pietersen sweeps - almost too full to be sweeping, but he gets it on the full and turns it behind square"
128,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run quietly turned on the front foot through midwicket"
129,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run once again, an Ashley-Giles-esque line on leg stump and it's clipped for a single to leg"
130,"Hogg to Bell, 3 runs lovely shot, back-cutting with deftness, just using the pace of the ball to guide the ball down to third man"
131,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run milked to cover for another single"
132,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run drifts this onto his leg stump who turns it past square leg for his fifty"
133,"Symonds to Bell, no run pushed back to Symonds. To his right"
134,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run short of a length, Bell turns it off his hip and there's his fifty - his tenth in ODIs"
135,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run dropped! Pietersen has been dropped, by Ponting at mid-on - but it was a terrific effort. A blinding attempt, diving to his right but he just couldn't hold on. It was a slower ball which came out as a full toss, Pietersen tried to whip it over midwicket but got a slight leading edge"
136,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run pushed back to Symonds"
137,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run pushed out into the covers"
138,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen's desperate to throw it away here. Too straight to be sweeping, and he just gets it over Gilchrist's head"
139,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run but he can this time, timing it nicely off the back foot"
140,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs just short of a length, paddled through midwicket - really well placed indeed and there's the 100 partnership"
141,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs cracked through the covers, like only Pietersen seems able to do - a flourishing, expansive drive but the sweeper out there cuts off four"
142,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run better line from Hogg this time, just on leg-and-middle and it's blocked out"
143,"Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs ooh that's a terrific stroke from Bell - from a poor ball from Symonds, too short, drifting down leg and Bell works it down past short fine leg. Class"
144,"Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs shot! Too short from Symonds and again down the leg side, Bell flicks this time - over the same fine-leg region for four. Top class"
145,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run once again it's turned down to fine leg but just for a single this time"
146,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen lunges forward with that huge, erm, lunge and pumps it to mid-on"
147,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run a pull, crashed over midwicket. Not fully in control of it I don't think, nor timing it sufficiently"
148,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run full toss which is pumped to Hayden at mid-off, who misfields"
149,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run wide of the leg stump, Pietersen chumps it to midwicket"
150,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run and again Bell just nudges it to leg"
151,"Hogg to Pietersen, 4 byes close! Very, very close. A quicker ball, outside off, Pietersen tries to sweep it on the full and it just passes his off stump, evades his bottom edge, evades Gilchrist and Hogg's tongue is flapping around uncontrollably"
152,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run nudged to square leg for a single"
153,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run ah, Bell grabs a reverse-sweep from his locker"
154,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run well bowled! Full, fast, straight and defended on the front foot"
155,"Tait to Bell, no run clunked off the back foot but he can't time it, working it to leg for a zero"
156,"Tait to Bell, no run ooh driven, and driven hard, but - well, no, it wasn't timed at all. I'm speaking rubbish"
157,"Tait to Bell, 1 run ooh close! Very, very close to chopping on there. He went to drive on the up but got a thick inside edge"
158,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run that was quick - and there's the first sign of reverse swing from Tait, that one just bending into the batsman who mis-defends"
159,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs and it's punched, firmly, through midwicket"
160,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run great start, right on off stump and it's defended"
161,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run punched to mid-off on the up, and Hodge is quick to throw down the stumps, or at least attempt to, but the throw was wide. Pietersen is so quick between the stumps"
162,"McGrath to Bell, 2 runs ah, deliciously, deftly late-cut down to third man"
163,"McGrath to Bell, no run too short, but Bell can't get a run here, just pushing it to cover"
164,"McGrath to Bell, no run tries to drop this out into the covers but can't get enough bat on it"
165,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs that is some shot! My word, punching McGrath off the back foot over cover. Fabulous shot"
166,"Tait to Pietersen, no run pulled on the up. You might think I've just made up that stroke, but in fact Pietersen plays it all the time. It's like a front footed pull, but while on the charge"
167,"Tait to Pietersen, no run dropped! Pietersen skies it over the bowler's head"
168,"Tait to Pietersen, no run ooh a slower ball which Pietersen reads and defends"
169,"Tait to Pietersen, no run wild and wooly, like a mountain sheep, down the leg side"
170,"Tait to Pietersen, (no ball) Tait is absolutely tearing in here. That was up to 94mpg (151kph) but the direction was all wrong, down the leg side and actually Gilchrist does brilliantly to prevent four"
171,"Tait to Bell, no run cracked to Hayden at mid-off who receives predictable ironic jeering from the crowd"
172,"Tait to Bell, no run quick and nasty again. Tait is absolutely spitting nails out there and Bell defends"
173,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run touch of reverse swing from McGrath, angling into Pietersen who tries to drive, and does drive, but can't time it"
174,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run too short and it's hammered through midwicket. No! It smacks into Rudi, the square-leg umpire who does a rather impressive star jump but the ball thuds into his left knee. Rudi doesn't flinch"
175,"McGrath to Bell, OUT oh there we go, Bell departs - McGrath perhaps held it back a touch, Bell trying to drive it over cover but his head fell back and the ball spooned to Hussey at extra cover"
176,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run a misdirected bouncer wide of Collingwood's off stump who evades it with ease"
177,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run too straight, prodded to leg but straight to mid-on"
178,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs well played! Attempted yorker which is dug out by Collingwood and his big spade, timing it surprisingly well to deep square leg"
179,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run tucked off the legs in front of square leg"
180,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run yorker out of the top drawer, Collingwood just gets bat on it and does well not to fall over in the process"
181,"Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT lovely delivery, top class that one: Collingwood looking for the reverse swing and playing away from his body on his back foot. There's just a thin edge - but one without doubt - and Gilchrist clings on"
182,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 run tries the inswinging yorker, just gets his radar wrong, and that's worked to leg, Flintoff off the mark immediately"
183,"Tait to Pietersen, no run outside off and that's just defended down off the back foot"
184,"Tait to Pietersen, no run excellent ball rounds off a very tidy over, that one shooting through past the chest after nipping back in, just a smidgen, off the seam and on to Gilchrist"
185,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run pops that one into space on the leg-side, the ball just catching his bat"
186,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run big loop and that one's worked in front of square"
187,"Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run turned away off his legs to square"
188,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run gets over the ball and looks to drive it through long-on, but has to check the shot a touch, and drives it back to the bowler"
189,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run good stuff again from Hogg, Pietersen only finding room to play that to square"
190,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run right up there, a slow, tricksy yorker, and Pietersen does well to shuffle, and reshuffle, his feet to find room to defend"
191,"Tait to Flintoff, no run pushed right up there, yorker, and that's driven to mid-on"
192,"Tait to Flintoff, no run banged down outside off, perhaps a touch short, but that's just worked off the back foot easily enough to the man at cover"
193,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 wide strays that one down leg, Tait immediately turns to look at Rudi Koertzen, expecting a wide... the umpire thinks about it, and then makes the sign"
194,"Tait to Flintoff, no run defended this time"
195,"Tait to Flintoff, no run up there on a good length, and that's defended forward"
196,"Tait to Flintoff, no run driven to mid-on this time"
197,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 run worked off his legs to deep square leg and Flintoff steals the strike"
198,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run does well to get the bat on it and work to leg"
199,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run pushes that one across the righthander, who drives into the covers"
200,"Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run swept firmly down to Bracken behind square"
201,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 leg byes attempted sweep shot, signalled as leg byes, and Pietersen plays under the ball which scoots on down to third man"
202,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run huge shouts for lbw, it pitched in line, but may have just gone on to clip off - there was enough doubt, though, and Pietersen had got a big stride in"
203,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run swept behind square this time"
204,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs over the wicket, that's worked out to deep midwicket, where there's some tidy one-two fielding and the ball's thrown back pretty quickly"
205,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run on leg, and that's shuffled into the midwicket region off the front foot"
206,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run outside off, moves off the seam away from the batsman a fraction"
207,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run poked down off the back foot into the covers this time"
208,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run straight drive, so straight, alas, that that crashes into the stumps at the other end"
209,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run down the off-side channel and that's cut off the back foot straight to point"
210,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run swept down on one knee and that's out to square"
211,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run oh, excellent delivery, moving off the seam away from the righthander and that wasn't picked whatsoever"
212,"Hogg to Flintoff, OUT a little touch of air and the ball tempts him outside his crease. It deviates past his outside edge, turning a touch and Gilchrist completes the move with some sharp glovework and Flintoff's on his way"
213,"Hogg to Bopara, 1 run tickled off his hips behind square"
214,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run driven out to long-off and that completes an excellent over by Hogg"
215,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run on leg and that's driven to the man in on the one on the leg-side"
216,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run across the righthander, with enough width for that to be driven to cover"
217,"Bracken to Bopara, 1 run on middle-and-leg, takes the pace off the ball, the batsman puts the pace back on with a swish to leg"
218,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run more width on the off side, and that's played to the sweeper out on the cover boundary"
219,"Bracken to Bopara, FOUR runs tried to drive it through the covers, but pressed down into the ground off the edge, a touch of luck as that rolls away to third man and he knows it, giving a little grin"
220,"Bracken to Bopara, no run defended this time"
221,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 wide goes for the sweep, misses"
222,"Hogg to Bopara, no run turns that one back in from just outside off and Bopara's temporarily bamboozled"
223,"Hogg to Bopara, no run on off, a hint of turn again, and Bopara deals with it with a defensive"
224,"Hogg to Bopara, no run nearly a carbon copy of the Flintoff dismissal, the wrong'un, turning away from the batsman... but Bopara stayed in his crease"
225,"Hogg to Bopara, no run gets tempted to play at that one away from his body"
226,"Hogg to Bopara, no run defended this time"
227,"Hogg to Bopara, no run and yet more defence to finish what's been another probing over"
228,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run driven to long-off"
229,"Bracken to Bopara, no run on middle-and-leg and that's swept to the man at midwicket"
230,"Bracken to Bopara, no run slower ball, and there's a half shout, that one pitching on leg"
231,"Bracken to Bopara, no run on middle, turning a touch away from the righthander, who pokes it into the off side"
232,"Bracken to Bopara, 1 run eased out to long-off this time"
233,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run on leg, and that's flamingo whipped off the front leg, just to the man, though, at midwicket"
234,"Symonds to Bopara, no run driven off the toes, without much power, to the man in the ring on leg"
235,"Symonds to Bopara, no run flaps the bat onto that one, wristing it to the man at leg"
236,"Symonds to Bopara, no run another dot as that one can only be manoeuvred to the leg"
237,"Symonds to Bopara, 2 runs more wristy stuff, this time finding the gap through the 45"
238,"Symonds to Bopara, 1 run driven to long-on"
239,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen backs away, exposing all three stumps, before the ball's even delivered and, as he did the last time he backed away, he drives on the front foot to long-off"
240,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run very full, very wide, Pietersen can only clump it back to him"
241,"McGrath to Pietersen, 2 runs hammered down the ground. Actually, it was more of a wooden mallet rather than a hammer - and long-on collected"
242,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run crashed through extra cover, to deep extra"
243,"McGrath to Bopara, no run and this angles into Bopara who is back and across, defending"
244,"McGrath to Bopara, no run full and straight, a touch of reverse swing into Bopara who again can only punch it back to McGrath"
245,"Symonds to Pietersen, no run and it's drifting down leg, Pietersen attempts to sweep but he forgot his chimney brush"
246,"Symonds to Pietersen, 2 runs ooh lovely timing there, really hammered it on the full out to deep extra cover. But straight to the man in the sandpit"
247,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run gives himself a touch of room outside leg before guiding it into cover, just using the pace of the ball"
248,"Symonds to Bopara, no run full and straight and driven back to Symonds"
249,"Symonds to Bopara, 1 run just a little wider and it's punched wider still of the bowler"
250,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run spooned aerially, but meekly, just short of mid-on"
251,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run a full bunger which takes the batsman by surprise, and it's smacked without power back past him to mid-on"
252,"Bracken to Bopara, OUT what a shot, but he's found Hussey at deep midwicket. It was an extraordinary flick, timing it to Hussey on the boundary who took an easy catch"
253,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run lovely ball, full and straight and KP can only hit it back to Bracken"
254,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run crashed back to the bowler again who gets a finger on it, parrying it onto the stumps. But Nixon, at the non-striker's end, is safe"
255,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs another full toss. They just can't get him away and it's sponged to deep extra"
256,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run full, if a little too full, allowing Pietersen to ping it down to long-on for a cheeky cockney single, thus retaining the strike"
257,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run and there's his hundred. Another full toss bunged down the ground. Pietersen skips through for a single, and jumps in delight - pumping his fist and roaring his pleasure."
258,"McGrath to Nixon, no run and he plays and misses"
259,"McGrath to Nixon, 1 run ah, good play from Nixon, shuffling around his crease like a man with ants in his jockstrap, putting McGrath off his line before working it to leg"
260,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run ooh here we go! Pietersen takes a step outside leg, tries to crack McGrath over his head but can only hammer it back to him"
261,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run brilliant bowling. Full and straight, Pietersen steps a mile outside his leg stump trying to whack him down the ground but can't time it"
262,"McGrath to Nixon, no run and again Nixon plays and misses"
263,"Tait to Pietersen, no run full, just a hint of reverse but it was too wide of the off stump. Pietersen lines up a colossal drive, but can only time it to mid-off"
264,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run straighter this time, allowing Pietersen to work it to leg"
265,"Tait to Bopara, no run a big, raucous appeal from Tait"
266,"Tait to Bopara, 1 leg bye and again, that's got to be out! No, again Rudi turns it down - again a magnificently vehement appeal from the bowler but, again, it's just sliding down leg"
267,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run oh blimey, a shot of typical madness from Pietersen. Short of a length from Tait and Pietersen tries to hit it into the ocean, but it skies over mid-on rather meekly"
268,"Tait to Bopara, no run well bowled indeed, an inswinging yorker which is dug out"
269,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run an it is an attempted yorker, but ends up a full bunger which is bunged back to the bowler, who parries it to mid-on allowing them to scamper a single"
270,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run Bopara digs this out to Symonds at mid-on and they set off for a quick single but, for once, Symonds can't field cleanly"
271,"McGrath to Pietersen, FOUR runs short, wide, cut past point for four. That's Pietersen's strength, capitalising on the bad balls - and that's his first four in 61 deliveries"
272,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run crashed to long off for a single"
273,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run grief, I thought he had bowled him there. The inside-edge clunky noise rather sounded like the stumps being shattered. As it was...it bobbled out to leg"
274,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run full and straight and blocked out"
275,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run a full bunger which Pietersen can't make anything of, just clobbering it off the back foot to a wideish long-on"
276,"Bracken to Nixon, 1 run makes this into a full toss, and works it to long-on for a single"
277,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs ooh Bracken sends it wide of Pietersen who slaps it - only just reaching it - flobbing it to mid-off"
278,"Bracken to Pietersen, OUT and he's gone this time, trying to lift Bracken for six but it's hit flat, and straight to Michael Clarke who needs not move a muscle, taking a very simple catch"
279,"Bracken to Mahmood, no run ooh close! A play and a miss from Saj Mahmood who is very nearly bowled"
280,"Bracken to Mahmood, OUT another full toss, well, what a catch! That's a marvellous catch from Hodge, Mahmood slicing it to him at backward point who tumbled to his right and took a fine catch"
281,"McGrath to Nixon, SIX runs much more like it! Nixon just flicked it, getting under the ball and smacking it over long-on. Terrific blow"
282,"McGrath to Nixon, OUT and he tries to replicate the shot before, smacking a full toss but straight down Hodge's throat at long-on who swallows it with ease"
283,"McGrath to Panesar, no run and he goes for an almighty heave ho over cover, swings and misses, his bat almost knocking him on his rear in its swishing follow through"
284,"McGrath to Panesar, 1 run Monty takes a step outside leg but, with a good eye, claps it to long-on"
285,"McGrath to Anderson, OUT full, swinging into Anderson who completely misreads the line. McGrath roars his appeal and up goes the finger"
286,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run driven softly off the back foot back to mid-off"
287,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run outside off and Pietersen lets that one carry through to Gilchrist"
288,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run another one skids through to the keeper just outside the off stump"
289,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run turns right back in from outside off and Pietersen's stride probably saves him"
290,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run defended this time"
291,"McGrath to Bell, no run McGrath nearly gets Bell there, Bell opening the face and just failing to get a tickle on the way through to Gilchrist. Bell has to lean on his bat, like a crutch for an old man, to compose himself"
292,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs hits through the line and that's a really decent shot from Bell, lifting that over cover"
293,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs two fours on the bounce - outside off again and that's a really great square drive, perfect timing, the sort of shot that when you nail it you know has gone the second you connect"
294,"McGrath to Bell, no run on a better line and length, Bell takes the power of it, working to covers, but he's still looking hungry every ball"
295,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs ah, hello, another sweet drive from Bell, this time he decides to lean into the ball and drive it wide of mid-off - a rocket"
296,"McGrath to Bell, no run more width outside off and Bell growls as he fails to give it the treatment through point, instead lashing it into the ground"
297,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is indeed getting impatient - going to sweep that, and missing"
298,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run he connects on the sweep this time, that one in front of square"
299,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run and another sweep"
300,"Clarke to Pietersen, FOUR runs this time Pietersen takes his usual two strides down and plays that one one-legged, on the front foot, and that's driven literally on the front foot through long-on"
301,"Clarke to Pietersen, SIX runs that's big! Short ball which Pietersen scoops that off the bottom of the bat and sends it high and travelling"
302,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run short again, this one outside off and Pietersen cheekily takes it from outside the sticks and sweeps it right over in front of square"
303,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run over the wicket, spears that one in outside leg, it turns back in and Pietersen swishes it back out off the back foot"
304,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run outside the line again, Pietersen on one knee and that's an easy sweep in front of square"
305,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run another sweep, finds the gap this time and they get the single"
306,"Hogg to Bell, no run right up there, straight, and there's a loud, but solo, shout from the bowler as the batsman defends"
307,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run driven out to mid-off this time, but straight to the man there"
308,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run up there and there's a sweep in front of square. They think about coming back for two and decide against it"
309,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run stepped down and swept that one from outside off round in front of square, really using the angles well"
310,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run quicker ball, but the batsman is up to the task, working it away to point"
311,"Clarke to Pietersen, no run width on that one, but Pietersen doesn't make the most, slamming it into the ground on the off side, not timing it at all"
312,"Clarke to Pietersen, FOUR runs got hold of it this time with a well-struck pull and Mr Hussey on the boundary can't cut it off despite his Superman-like dive"
313,"Clarke to Pietersen, 2 runs swept round really fine and there's an immediate call for two, the batsmen getting back comfortably"
314,"Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run sweep shot, just for the single this time - it's easily picked up"
315,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run right up there, tidy delivery and that's worked to short midwicket"
316,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run bit of loop on that one, not connected with properly, Pietersen struggling to get over it as much as anything, and that's driven back forward"
317,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs swept past Tait"
318,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run on one knee but doesn't get properly engaged, that one just dribbling out to square"
319,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run full toss, but again it's at an awkward height"
320,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run worked away off the toes to midwicket"
321,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run straight and that's driven out to long-on"
322,"Symonds to Bell, no run on the money, pitching on off, and Bell can only defend that one on his back foot"
323,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run strays on to leg and there's a quick single, Ponting have a shy at the stumps as Bell just drops that one into the short midwicket region"
324,"Symonds to Pietersen, 2 runs cheeky sweep, on one knee and sending it aerial, but safe, and taking on Hogg's arm with the second"
325,"Symonds to Pietersen, no run Pietersen doesn't get hold of that one which comes in at him on the off, fuller than he was expecting, and he defends"
326,"Symonds to Pietersen, FOUR runs this time Pietersen backed away showing all three sticks even before the ball had been bowled, and he smashes that one through the gap between mid-off and cover and it fair races away"
327,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run straight and that's paddled away square to bring up England's 100 in the 20th over"
328,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run a play and a miss this time, the ball pitching outside off and just going straight on, nearly taking the edge"
329,"Hogg to Bell, no run driven to mid-on this time"
330,"Hogg to Bell, no run worked into the covers this time"
331,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run drifting down leg and worked further to leg"
332,"Symonds to Bell, no run pushed back to Symonds and his massive hair"
333,"Symonds to Bell, 2 runs too short, pulled by Bell but Hodge does well out on the deep square leg boundary, saving four"
334,"Symonds to Bell, 2 runs delicately clipped through midwicket, aerially, for two"
335,"Symonds to Bell, no run too straight from Symonds but Bell can't pierce the gap at cover, just nudging it off his hip"
336,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run very neatly defended on the back foot, timing it well enough to earn him a single"
337,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run the wrong line from Hogg, outside his leg stump and Bell just turns it to leg"
338,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run again wide of the leg stump, Pietersen sweeps - almost too full to be sweeping, but he gets it on the full and turns it behind square"
339,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run quietly turned on the front foot through midwicket"
340,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run once again, an Ashley-Giles-esque line on leg stump and it's clipped for a single to leg"
341,"Hogg to Bell, 3 runs lovely shot, back-cutting with deftness, just using the pace of the ball to guide the ball down to third man"
342,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run milked to cover for another single"
343,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run drifts this onto his leg stump who turns it past square leg for his fifty"
344,"Symonds to Bell, no run pushed back to Symonds. To his right"
345,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run short of a length, Bell turns it off his hip and there's his fifty - his tenth in ODIs"
346,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run dropped! Pietersen has been dropped, by Ponting at mid-on - but it was a terrific effort. A blinding attempt, diving to his right but he just couldn't hold on. It was a slower ball which came out as a full toss, Pietersen tried to whip it over midwicket but got a slight leading edge"
347,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run pushed back to Symonds"
348,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run pushed out into the covers"
349,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen's desperate to throw it away here. Too straight to be sweeping, and he just gets it over Gilchrist's head"
350,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run but he can this time, timing it nicely off the back foot"
351,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs just short of a length, paddled through midwicket - really well placed indeed and there's the 100 partnership"
352,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 runs cracked through the covers, like only Pietersen seems able to do - a flourishing, expansive drive but the sweeper out there cuts off four"
353,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run better line from Hogg this time, just on leg-and-middle and it's blocked out"
354,"Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs ooh that's a terrific stroke from Bell - from a poor ball from Symonds, too short, drifting down leg and Bell works it down past short fine leg. Class"
355,"Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs shot! Too short from Symonds and again down the leg side, Bell flicks this time - over the same fine-leg region for four. Top class"
356,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run once again it's turned down to fine leg but just for a single this time"
357,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen lunges forward with that huge, erm, lunge and pumps it to mid-on"
358,"Symonds to Bell, 1 run a pull, crashed over midwicket. Not fully in control of it I don't think, nor timing it sufficiently"
359,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run full toss which is pumped to Hayden at mid-off, who misfields"
360,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run wide of the leg stump, Pietersen chumps it to midwicket"
361,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run and again Bell just nudges it to leg"
362,"Hogg to Pietersen, 4 byes close! Very, very close. A quicker ball, outside off, Pietersen tries to sweep it on the full and it just passes his off stump, evades his bottom edge, evades Gilchrist and Hogg's tongue is flapping around uncontrollably"
363,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run nudged to square leg for a single"
364,"Hogg to Bell, 1 run ah, Bell grabs a reverse-sweep from his locker"
365,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run well bowled! Full, fast, straight and defended on the front foot"
366,"Tait to Bell, no run clunked off the back foot but he can't time it, working it to leg for a zero"
367,"Tait to Bell, no run ooh driven, and driven hard, but - well, no, it wasn't timed at all. I'm speaking rubbish"
368,"Tait to Bell, 1 run ooh close! Very, very close to chopping on there. He went to drive on the up but got a thick inside edge"
369,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run that was quick - and there's the first sign of reverse swing from Tait, that one just bending into the batsman who mis-defends"
370,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs and it's punched, firmly, through midwicket"
371,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run great start, right on off stump and it's defended"
372,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run punched to mid-off on the up, and Hodge is quick to throw down the stumps, or at least attempt to, but the throw was wide. Pietersen is so quick between the stumps"
373,"McGrath to Bell, 2 runs ah, deliciously, deftly late-cut down to third man"
374,"McGrath to Bell, no run too short, but Bell can't get a run here, just pushing it to cover"
375,"McGrath to Bell, no run tries to drop this out into the covers but can't get enough bat on it"
376,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs that is some shot! My word, punching McGrath off the back foot over cover. Fabulous shot"
377,"Tait to Pietersen, no run pulled on the up. You might think I've just made up that stroke, but in fact Pietersen plays it all the time. It's like a front footed pull, but while on the charge"
378,"Tait to Pietersen, no run dropped! Pietersen skies it over the bowler's head"
379,"Tait to Pietersen, no run ooh a slower ball which Pietersen reads and defends"
380,"Tait to Pietersen, no run wild and wooly, like a mountain sheep, down the leg side"
381,"Tait to Pietersen, (no ball) Tait is absolutely tearing in here. That was up to 94mpg (151kph) but the direction was all wrong, down the leg side and actually Gilchrist does brilliantly to prevent four"
382,"Tait to Bell, no run cracked to Hayden at mid-off who receives predictable ironic jeering from the crowd"
383,"Tait to Bell, no run quick and nasty again. Tait is absolutely spitting nails out there and Bell defends"
384,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run touch of reverse swing from McGrath, angling into Pietersen who tries to drive, and does drive, but can't time it"
385,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run too short and it's hammered through midwicket. No! It smacks into Rudi, the square-leg umpire who does a rather impressive star jump but the ball thuds into his left knee. Rudi doesn't flinch"
386,"McGrath to Bell, OUT oh there we go, Bell departs - McGrath perhaps held it back a touch, Bell trying to drive it over cover but his head fell back and the ball spooned to Hussey at extra cover"
387,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run a misdirected bouncer wide of Collingwood's off stump who evades it with ease"
388,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run too straight, prodded to leg but straight to mid-on"
389,"McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs well played! Attempted yorker which is dug out by Collingwood and his big spade, timing it surprisingly well to deep square leg"
390,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run tucked off the legs in front of square leg"
391,"Tait to PD Collingwood, no run yorker out of the top drawer, Collingwood just gets bat on it and does well not to fall over in the process"
392,"Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT lovely delivery, top class that one: Collingwood looking for the reverse swing and playing away from his body on his back foot. There's just a thin edge - but one without doubt - and Gilchrist clings on"
393,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 run tries the inswinging yorker, just gets his radar wrong, and that's worked to leg, Flintoff off the mark immediately"
394,"Tait to Pietersen, no run outside off and that's just defended down off the back foot"
395,"Tait to Pietersen, no run excellent ball rounds off a very tidy over, that one shooting through past the chest after nipping back in, just a smidgen, off the seam and on to Gilchrist"
396,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run pops that one into space on the leg-side, the ball just catching his bat"
397,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run big loop and that one's worked in front of square"
398,"Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run turned away off his legs to square"
399,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run gets over the ball and looks to drive it through long-on, but has to check the shot a touch, and drives it back to the bowler"
400,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run good stuff again from Hogg, Pietersen only finding room to play that to square"
401,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run right up there, a slow, tricksy yorker, and Pietersen does well to shuffle, and reshuffle, his feet to find room to defend"
402,"Tait to Flintoff, no run pushed right up there, yorker, and that's driven to mid-on"
403,"Tait to Flintoff, no run banged down outside off, perhaps a touch short, but that's just worked off the back foot easily enough to the man at cover"
404,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 wide strays that one down leg, Tait immediately turns to look at Rudi Koertzen, expecting a wide... the umpire thinks about it, and then makes the sign"
405,"Tait to Flintoff, no run defended this time"
406,"Tait to Flintoff, no run up there on a good length, and that's defended forward"
407,"Tait to Flintoff, no run driven to mid-on this time"
408,"Tait to Flintoff, 1 run worked off his legs to deep square leg and Flintoff steals the strike"
409,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run does well to get the bat on it and work to leg"
410,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run pushes that one across the righthander, who drives into the covers"
411,"Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run swept firmly down to Bracken behind square"
412,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 leg byes attempted sweep shot, signalled as leg byes, and Pietersen plays under the ball which scoots on down to third man"
413,"Hogg to Pietersen, no run huge shouts for lbw, it pitched in line, but may have just gone on to clip off - there was enough doubt, though, and Pietersen had got a big stride in"
414,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run swept behind square this time"
415,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs over the wicket, that's worked out to deep midwicket, where there's some tidy one-two fielding and the ball's thrown back pretty quickly"
416,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run on leg, and that's shuffled into the midwicket region off the front foot"
417,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run outside off, moves off the seam away from the batsman a fraction"
418,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run poked down off the back foot into the covers this time"
419,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run straight drive, so straight, alas, that that crashes into the stumps at the other end"
420,"Bracken to Flintoff, no run down the off-side channel and that's cut off the back foot straight to point"
421,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run swept down on one knee and that's out to square"
422,"Hogg to Flintoff, no run oh, excellent delivery, moving off the seam away from the righthander and that wasn't picked whatsoever"
423,"Hogg to Flintoff, OUT a little touch of air and the ball tempts him outside his crease. It deviates past his outside edge, turning a touch and Gilchrist completes the move with some sharp glovework and Flintoff's on his way"
424,"Hogg to Bopara, 1 run tickled off his hips behind square"
425,"Hogg to Pietersen, 1 run driven out to long-off and that completes an excellent over by Hogg"
426,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run on leg and that's driven to the man in on the one on the leg-side"
427,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run across the righthander, with enough width for that to be driven to cover"
428,"Bracken to Bopara, 1 run on middle-and-leg, takes the pace off the ball, the batsman puts the pace back on with a swish to leg"
429,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run more width on the off side, and that's played to the sweeper out on the cover boundary"
430,"Bracken to Bopara, FOUR runs tried to drive it through the covers, but pressed down into the ground off the edge, a touch of luck as that rolls away to third man and he knows it, giving a little grin"
431,"Bracken to Bopara, no run defended this time"
432,"Hogg to Pietersen, 2 wide goes for the sweep, misses"
433,"Hogg to Bopara, no run turns that one back in from just outside off and Bopara's temporarily bamboozled"
434,"Hogg to Bopara, no run on off, a hint of turn again, and Bopara deals with it with a defensive"
435,"Hogg to Bopara, no run nearly a carbon copy of the Flintoff dismissal, the wrong'un, turning away from the batsman... but Bopara stayed in his crease"

437,"Hogg to Bopara, no run defended this time"

443,"Bracken to Bopara, 1 run eased out to long-off this time"
444,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run on leg, and that's flamingo whipped off the front leg, just to the man, though, at midwicket"
445,"Symonds to Bopara, no run driven off the toes, without much power, to the man in the ring on leg"
446,"Symonds to Bopara, no run flaps the bat onto that one, wristing it to the man at leg"
447,"Symonds to Bopara, no run another dot as that one can only be manoeuvred to the leg"
448,"Symonds to Bopara, 2 runs more wristy stuff, this time finding the gap through the 45"
449,"Symonds to Bopara, 1 run driven to long-on"
450,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen backs away, exposing all three stumps, before the ball's even delivered and, as he did the last time he backed away, he drives on the front foot to long-off"
451,"Tait to Bopara, FOUR runs lovely shot from Bopara, a check-drive through cover - perfectly placed. Hayden runs in the sandpit and doesn't dive, such is the danger of the outfield. Thus"
452,"Tait to Bopara, 1 run drifting down leg and it bobbles off his pads"
453,"Tait to Pietersen, no run Pietersen lines up a rocketing drive but it bobbles pathetically back to the bowler"
454,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run turned off his hip"
455,"Tait to Bopara, 1 run short of a length, Bopara rocks back and, with wristy wrists, wrists it through midwicket"
456,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run good running, good batting - Pietersen just dropped it to leg and scampering through for a single. He had to get his skates on, mind - but he did, and they were good skates"
457,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run ooh it's powered back to the old man McGrath who bends down, without doing his back in, and gets half a hand to prevent four"
458,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 wide that was rather close to plucking out his leg stump there, and Gilchrist missed a potential stumping chance. Rather unfairly called a wide, too"
459,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run cracked on the front foot with a great deal of flourish, but he finds the sweeper on the rope"
460,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run timed back to McGrath who again fields well in his follow through"
461,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run too short to be driving, but he does drive and it's worked to leg"
462,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run short, pulled around the corner"
463,"McGrath to Bopara, no run ooh and Bopara goes for it, pulling it off the front foot just short of midwicket"
464,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run very full, very wide, Pietersen can only clump it back to him"
465,"McGrath to Pietersen, 2 runs hammered down the ground. Actually, it was more of a wooden mallet rather than a hammer - and long-on collected"
466,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run crashed through extra cover, to deep extra"
467,"McGrath to Bopara, no run and this angles into Bopara who is back and across, defending"
468,"McGrath to Bopara, no run full and straight, a touch of reverse swing into Bopara who again can only punch it back to McGrath"
469,"Symonds to Pietersen, no run and it's drifting down leg, Pietersen attempts to sweep but he forgot his chimney brush"
470,"Symonds to Pietersen, 2 runs ooh lovely timing there, really hammered it on the full out to deep extra cover. But straight to the man in the sandpit"
471,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run gives himself a touch of room outside leg before guiding it into cover, just using the pace of the ball"
472,"Symonds to Bopara, no run full and straight and driven back to Symonds"
473,"Symonds to Bopara, 1 run just a little wider and it's punched wider still of the bowler"
474,"Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run spooned aerially, but meekly, just short of mid-on"
475,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run a full bunger which takes the batsman by surprise, and it's smacked without power back past him to mid-on"
476,"Bracken to Bopara, OUT what a shot, but he's found Hussey at deep midwicket. It was an extraordinary flick, timing it to Hussey on the boundary who took an easy catch"
477,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run lovely ball, full and straight and KP can only hit it back to Bracken"
478,"Bracken to Pietersen, no run crashed back to the bowler again who gets a finger on it, parrying it onto the stumps. But Nixon, at the non-striker's end, is safe"
479,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs another full toss. They just can't get him away and it's sponged to deep extra"
480,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run full, if a little too full, allowing Pietersen to ping it down to long-on for a cheeky cockney single, thus retaining the strike"
481,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run and there's his hundred. Another full toss bunged down the ground. Pietersen skips through for a single, and jumps in delight - pumping his fist and roaring his pleasure."
482,"McGrath to Nixon, no run and he plays and misses"
483,"McGrath to Nixon, 1 run ah, good play from Nixon, shuffling around his crease like a man with ants in his jockstrap, putting McGrath off his line before working it to leg"
484,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run ooh here we go! Pietersen takes a step outside leg, tries to crack McGrath over his head but can only hammer it back to him"
485,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run brilliant bowling. Full and straight, Pietersen steps a mile outside his leg stump trying to whack him down the ground but can't time it"
486,"McGrath to Nixon, no run and again Nixon plays and misses"
487,"Tait to Pietersen, no run full, just a hint of reverse but it was too wide of the off stump. Pietersen lines up a colossal drive, but can only time it to mid-off"
488,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run straighter this time, allowing Pietersen to work it to leg"
489,"Tait to Bopara, no run a big, raucous appeal from Tait"
490,"Tait to Bopara, 1 leg bye and again, that's got to be out! No, again Rudi turns it down - again a magnificently vehement appeal from the bowler but, again, it's just sliding down leg"
491,"Tait to Pietersen, 1 run oh blimey, a shot of typical madness from Pietersen. Short of a length from Tait and Pietersen tries to hit it into the ocean, but it skies over mid-on rather meekly"
492,"Tait to Bopara, no run well bowled indeed, an inswinging yorker which is dug out"
493,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run an it is an attempted yorker, but ends up a full bunger which is bunged back to the bowler, who parries it to mid-on allowing them to scamper a single"
494,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run Bopara digs this out to Symonds at mid-on and they set off for a quick single but, for once, Symonds can't field cleanly"
495,"McGrath to Pietersen, FOUR runs short, wide, cut past point for four. That's Pietersen's strength, capitalising on the bad balls - and that's his first four in 61 deliveries"
496,"McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run crashed to long off for a single"
497,"McGrath to Bopara, 1 run grief, I thought he had bowled him there. The inside-edge clunky noise rather sounded like the stumps being shattered. As it was...it bobbled out to leg"
498,"McGrath to Pietersen, no run full and straight and blocked out"
499,"Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run a full bunger which Pietersen can't make anything of, just clobbering it off the back foot to a wideish long-on"
500,"Bracken to Nixon, 1 run makes this into a full toss, and works it to long-on for a single"
501,"Bracken to Pietersen, 2 runs ooh Bracken sends it wide of Pietersen who slaps it - only just reaching it - flobbing it to mid-off"
502,"Bracken to Pietersen, OUT and he's gone this time, trying to lift Bracken for six but it's hit flat, and straight to Michael Clarke who needs not move a muscle, taking a very simple catch"
503,"Bracken to Mahmood, no run ooh close! A play and a miss from Saj Mahmood who is very nearly bowled"
504,"Bracken to Mahmood, OUT another full toss, well, what a catch! That's a marvellous catch from Hodge, Mahmood slicing it to him at backward point who tumbled to his right and took a fine catch"
505,"McGrath to Nixon, SIX runs much more like it! Nixon just flicked it, getting under the ball and smacking it over long-on. Terrific blow"
506,"McGrath to Nixon, OUT and he tries to replicate the shot before, smacking a full toss but straight down Hodge's throat at long-on who swallows it with ease"
507,"McGrath to Panesar, no run and he goes for an almighty heave ho over cover, swings and misses, his bat almost knocking him on his rear in its swishing follow through"
508,"McGrath to Panesar, 1 run Monty takes a step outside leg but, with a good eye, claps it to long-on"
509,"McGrath to Anderson, OUT full, swinging into Anderson who completely misreads the line. McGrath roars his appeal and up goes the finger"
510,"And that caps a brilliant performance and comeback from Australia. England were going building nicely with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease, but Hogg's fine spell stifled their momentum before the seamers came back and cut through the middle order. Shaun Tait bowled a magnificent couple of spells; straight,"
511,"1.45pm Welcome back. Here come Gilchrist and Hayden, needing five an over, which should be comfortable on this track. Andrew Miller reckons 247 is a winning total. Let's find out shall we? It'll be James Anderson to take the new ball, a cricket ball, and not the beach ball that's blown onto the pitch. Here we go"
512,"Hayden's preparing to face his first ball now, just waiting for Anderson to be ready"
513,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run over the wicket, and there's no swing on that one, neither from the ball, nor the batsman, who opts to live as it runs away down the off stick"
514,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run again no swing, that one angling flat across Gilchrist, who reaches out to defend"
515,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run more width outside off, although this was tighter on the sticks, Gilchrist leans into that one and drives straight to Bell who ends up sitting on the floor in his efforts to stop it"
516,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 bye swing at last and nearly does for Gilchrist, who steps into the shot and drives at it, but it swings a touch late and nearly takes the inside edge"
517,"Anderson to Hayden, no run scoots that one down the off-side, wide enough for Hayden to leave first up"
518,"Anderson to Hayden, no run really close - huge shouts from everyone, but Bowden shakes his head early, and firmly, that one pitches in line, straightens and would have taken off-and-middle three quarters up the sticks. Perhaps the umpire thinks he hit it, or that it pitched outside leg. It looked very close"
519,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs full toss and Gilchrist doesn't miss out - far from, in fact, leaning into that one and driving it off the bottom of the bat through cover"
520,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another huge shout, Rudi Koertzen is unmoved, and that one would have moved on to take the off stump according to HawkEye. Mahmood doesn't think so, though, nearly backing into the batsman as he moves back and back in his appeal"
521,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run dinked into the ground off the back foot and on to the man at cover"
522,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run Gilchrist doesn't get hold of that one, driving into the ground and straight to the man in short and straight on the off side"
523,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs short, on the legs, and you really can't bowl it there to him - help yourself stuff - and that pull shot nearly took out Bowden who did a last-minute shimmy at square"
524,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another drive off the back foot, he doesn't connect, and indeed it wasn't the length he was expecting - but it's certainly a signal of his attacking intent"
525,"Anderson to Hayden, no run pushed right up there and that's driven back out, without much power, to long-on"
526,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide great delivery to a righthander... unfortunately Hayden isn't, and that one slinks down leg, on a good length, but wide enough to be called so"
527,"Anderson to Hayden, no run clunk-and-run, Hayden dropping that one into the covers and they set off for a risky single, but head back"
528,"Anderson to Hayden, no run defended into the leg side"
529,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs scorching shot off a half-volley, just leant on that one on the rise and it raced away through the covers"
530,"Anderson to Hayden, no run tickled off the pads in front of short midwicket and Pietersen does very well to dive on the run, sliding to his right to pick that one up"
531,"Anderson to Hayden, no run straight and that's worked into the leg side without much fuss"
532,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pitches up and rises at the batsman who defends down off the back foot"
533,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run on off and that's driven to the man at cover"
534,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs on leg and Gilchrist is so quick to get onto that one - fast eyes, fast hands, and that's swished away off his pads through orthodox fine leg"
535,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run straight and that's worked straight to Vaughan at midwicket who picks it up and mock-shies at Gilchrist's stumps"
536,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, wide, and that's just easily left alone"
537,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run right up there, straight, and that's driven to the man straight in on the off"
538,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide comes down the track, tries to hook, and misses it completely - the ball strayghing down leg"
539,"Anderson to Hayden, no run comes forward again and drives this one to mid-on this time"
540,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs beautiful shot that one - short, and that's hit so cleanly over and in front of midwicket"
541,"Anderson to Hayden, no run pushed right up there and that's defended"
542,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide leg-side filth"
543,"Anderson to Hayden, no run played off the back foot, with a strong defence, Hayden's head behind the bat"
544,"Anderson to Hayden, no run short and that's driven to the man in at short midwicket"
545,"Anderson to Hayden, no run defended this time"
546,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, picked, and defended"
547,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, picked again, and eased back out on the off-side with a straight bat"
548,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run on leg and that's turned away off the pads to midwicket"
549,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs on leg, and that's merely eased away through fine leg"
550,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 run driven out to long-off"
551,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 run straighter, but still a touch short, and that's eased out to midwicket"
552,"Anderson to Hayden, no run connects strongly with that one, on the back foot, and defended into the covers"
553,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs steps into that powerful, well-placed drive through cover. Four all the way"
554,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pushed right up there and that's defended down off the back foot into the covers"
555,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run width, and Pietersen spares Mahmood's blushes by snapping up the ball at cover"
556,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 2 runs short and that's turned away behind square, Anderson misfielding on the backward-of-square-leg boundary"
557,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run on leg once more and that's whisked away off the hips behind square"
558,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run slower ball, outside off, and that one finds the fielder at cover"
559,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run slower ball, and that's good running from the pair, as that one's nibbled out to mid-off with a mere push"
560,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 run pushed right up there and some more good running, that one nudged towards mid-off"
561,"Anderson to Gilchrist, FOUR runs on legs and that's a piece of superb timing off the hips which races away through square"
562,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 2 runs width, and Gilchrist cover-drives"
563,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run played off the back foot to cover"
564,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run play and a miss this time, Gilchrist playing away from his body, driving to cover, but the ball shoots through"
565,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run good ball to end the over, straighter, tucking him up for room and he defends down off the back foot"
566,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run beat short cover, and just to the left of extra-cover, who ran round and dived... Bell the fielder"
567,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run big backlift and he crashes that one to point"
568,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs slower ball that may as well have had a bell on it, width, and that's cut really well off the back foot and that's a typical Gilchrist full-throttle number"
569,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run a touch, only a touch, of room and that's a tip-and-top tip-and-run"
570,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run slower ball and Hayden just drops his bat onto that one, working it behind square"
571,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run straight, and that's just dibbled into short midwicket off the back foot"
572,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run ooh and immediately he induces an inside edge from Hayden's heavy-footed attempted clump through the covers"
573,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and Hayden marches down the pitch, ala Ian Bell but with great threat, but like Bell he can't make anything of it, just pushing it back to the bowler"
574,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run good line and length and Hayden guides it to gully"
575,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs that is savage. Unhindered violence from Hayden, marching down the pitch and fairly smiting the ball over midwicket which bounces once, maybe twice, before thudding into the boundary boards"
576,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run oh and he's hammered this one too through the covers, but Bell is quick to dive to his right and prevent four"
577,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run good line, but it's full enough to be driven to mid-off for a thoroughly cheeky single"
578,"Panesar to Ponting, no run on middle-and-off, good loop from Monty and it's driven back to the bowler"
579,"Panesar to Ponting, no run excellent line again - at a good, nagging pace. Not too quick. And Ponting watchfully blocks it out"
580,"Panesar to Ponting, no run again good pace - he's been too quick through the air so far in the tournament, and Ponting defends"
581,"Panesar to Ponting, no run Ponting once again forward to defend this"
582,"Panesar to Ponting, no run and just a touch tighter in line, on leg stump, and Ponting smothers the spin"
583,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run smacked to cover with immense power"
584,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run a full bunger which Hayden whacks into the ground, with intent, but it bobbles out to Vaughan at mid-off"
585,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and a huge swing-and-a-miss from Hayden who, had he connected with that, would've smacked it into another island"
586,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run touch wider of the off stump and he shoulders arms"
587,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs and here he goes. The chirping isn't working"
588,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and he pushes forward, guiding it to gully"
589,"Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs Ponting forgets all about the defensive prods which characterised Monty's previous over and smacks him over long-off, very nearly for six"
590,"Panesar to Ponting, no run quicker and fuller"
591,"Panesar to Ponting, no run drags Ponting forward who pushes it to leg"
592,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run too short from Monty but actually he gets away with it, Ponting cracking it off the back foot but straight to cover and they pick up just a single"
593,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run easily worked to mid-off for another single"
594,"Panesar to Ponting, no run good line outside off, on a good length too and it's guided off the face of the bat into the off side"
595,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run no great pace from Flintoff there, but it's a good line and worked into the covers"
596,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run Hayden comes ominously down the pitch, making it into a full bunger but Hayden can't bisect the gap in the covers"
597,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run solidly forward, easing this behind square"
598,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run another full toss - we've seen a dozen or so of those today - and Ponting just whips it through midwicket with a flash of the wrists"
599,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run that's an excellent piece of cricket, of awareness by the two batsman. Wide of the crease from Flintoff, and Hayden uses the angle to guide it down to Monty at third man. Aware of his weak throw, they steal a single"
600,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run bat-padded out into the off side"
601,"Panesar to Hayden, no run and the big, tall left hander is watchful in defence"
602,"Panesar to Hayden, 2 runs less watchful this time, just angling this to a short third man"
603,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run and again it's wide enough for Hayden to snick it down to a short third man who, to his credit, is quick to skip across - but Ponting is quicker, and sprints through for a single"
604,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run Ponting skips down the pitch but is almost beaten in the flight, and is saved by bat-padding it away"
605,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run nudged to the leg side, and another single is milked"
606,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run swept down to short fine leg, and another piece of excellent running between the wickets grabs them another single"
607,"Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs oh that's immensely bad luck for old Flintoff, Ponting driving on the up and very nearly chopping it on. Nixon hasn't a hope and it flies down for four"
608,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run pushed without great timing to Anderson at mid-off. Ponting wants two"
609,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run a full toss which Hayden pumps to Anderson again"
610,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run beautifully stroked but straight to the Sherminator, Ian Bell, at cover"
611,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run nearly! Flintoff sent it a foot wider"
612,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run on-driven but again Ponting can't place it, and it's smudged to mid-on"
613,"Panesar to Hayden, no run good line, on middle-and-off and quick enough to force Hayden's defence"
614,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run just outside the off stump and, this time, a little shorter allowing Hayden to guide it down to third man"
615,"Panesar to Ponting, no run wide of the off stump, crashed to mid-off"
616,"Panesar to Ponting, no run ooh and he sweeps a flatter delivery, a straighter delivery too but no run on offer there"
617,"Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs well, that's just effortless frankly. Not a very good ball, not turning enough and it's delightfully cracked over mid-off for four"
618,"Panesar to Ponting, no run drags Ponting forward here, nice bit of turn and he smothers it cautiously. Good comeback from Monty"
619,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run full and straight - too full, in fact - and Hayden drives with a crack of the bat to mid-off for a single"
620,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run ah, superbly cut - a late-cut off a fast bowler - but straight to point"
621,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run straighter delivery this time, and Ponting bat-pads it into the covers"
622,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run again it's watchfully defended by Ponting to a ball just outside his off stump. Good, nagging line this"
623,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run good line again, and Ponting refuses to be tempted into driving"
624,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run a huge appeal from Flintoff who is absolutely convinced he has Ponting leg before, but replays indicate the ball was just going over the top. And he was outside the line, too. Not out, then"
625,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run good start to Clarke, just on off stump and cutting back into him a touch. Pushed out into the covers"
626,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run pushed to Strauss at mid-on - oh, who fumbles pathetically. Schoolboy error there and Clarke's off the mark"
627,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run ooh and that swings in a touch to Ponting"
628,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run flicked to midwicket, but he can't bisect the gap"
629,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run late cut for a single"
630,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run outside off and that's driven to mid-on"
631,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run pushed up there outside off and that was driven down off the back foot to cover"
632,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run quickly single to mid-on, good scampering there, like that"
633,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run on a good line and length, and that one is just fended into the covers"
634,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run squeezed into the leg-side from off on the front foot and there's some good communication from the pair"
635,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run pushed right up there and that's pushed again into the covers"
636,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run no great pace, of course, but he places that one on a good length and Ponting can't get it away"
637,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run again on an awkward length, just tucking Ponting up on line with off, and he fends down"
638,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run width this time and Ponting should have cashed in. Instead, he short changes himself with a drive straight to cover"
639,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run straighter, but overcompensates with the line, allowing Ponting to nibble that one down off his hips just in front of square for an easy single"
640,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run good line this time, on off, but drags it a touch short and that's driven to mid-on"
641,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run back to where he started this over, on a good line and awkward length and that's just defended forward"
642,"Anderson to Clarke, no run worked to short midwicket"
643,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run outside off and that's worked well into the covers and there's some good quick running"
644,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run on leg and there's a run-out chance if Vaughan had hit at Ponting's end"
645,"Anderson to Clarke, no run on leg and that's driven in front of midwicket"
646,"Anderson to Clarke, no run driven out into short midwicket"
647,"Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke squared up there, and that's an excellent over from Anderson, the batsman only able to defend that down into the off-side off the back foot"
648,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run driven out to mid-on and there's a quick single there, clever stuff"
649,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run up there and that's defended on the back foot"
650,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run single to Strauss at mid-on, again risky, but in fact he would have been back comfortably"
651,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run Ponting pierces the leg-side with a punt off his legs"
652,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run leans over that one which is slightly on leg and works it to midwicket"
653,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run driven to long-on for an easy single"
654,"Anderson to Ponting, no run thinks about driving that one on the up, but in the end he has to defend"
655,"Anderson to Ponting, no run more of the good stuff, this one straight and up there, and Ponting works that to mid-on, thinking of the single, but deciding against it in the end"
656,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run tricks that one off leg, it's a bit short too, with a lovely clip to midwicket"
657,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke comes down the track before Anderson releases, short one and he misses out, trying to pull that, but it clatters straight into his thigh off the edge and they eke out a single"
658,"Anderson to Ponting, 2 runs hit firmly through midwicket, nice shot, that"
659,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run took the pace off that one and it's defended forward"
660,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run great drift in the air, reversing back in to the batsman who does well to get some bat on it"
661,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 3 runs driven forward and there's a misfield through cover. Panesar does well to stop it just inside the rope"
662,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run bit of loop on that one and that's driven to mid-on"
663,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run drifted back into the righthander and that's driven out to the cover boundary"
664,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run slower delivery and that's driven to Bell at short midwicket"
665,"Anderson to Ponting, no run driven out to point"
666,"Anderson to Ponting, no run stands on tiptoes to reach into that shot and play down to cover"
667,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run short and pulled from outside off in front of midwicket"
668,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run straight, but Clarke's ready for that, and he works it in front of square and they run through very quickly"
669,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run played behind square and Panesar does well behind square on the boundary... ah, deep backward square leg, that will be it"
670,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs driven out to the cover boundary and there's an easy two"
671,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, FOUR runs waited and waited and flicked it with his wrists down to fine leg. The ball wheezes over the line in the end, much like a marathon runner"
672,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run defended down off the back foot this time"
673,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run a hint of inswing there and Ponting plays that into his leg"
674,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 wide an attempted stumping from an off-side wide. A bit harsh the wide, you'd suspect, but no doubt on the fact that Ponting's foot was firmly grounded"
675,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs well swished off the hips but there's some great teamwork on the boundary, Anderson sliding to keep the ball in and Pietersen winging it back"
676,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run straight, up there, and that's driven out to long-off"
677,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run on a length outside off and that's driven straight to the fielder at cover"
678,"Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run on a length outside off and that's driven straight to the fielder at cover"
679,"Mahmood to Clarke, 2 runs dabbed down off the back foot behind point"
680,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run driven through cover"
681,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run driven forward back to the bowler, who can't get a hand on it, and the mid-off does the tidying up"
682,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs just leans into that one and times it off the bottom of the bat through cover"
683,"Panesar to Clarke, no run driven back to Panesar who stifles the ball like a groping puppy. Good stifling"
684,"Panesar to Clarke, no run played off the front foot to short midwicket"
685,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run driven to cover"
686,"Panesar to Ponting, no run this time it's Ponting's turn to stifle, head over the ball in a good forward defence"
687,"Panesar to Ponting, no run driven out to Collingwood at mid-on, there's no run on"
688,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run this one's driven to cover"
689,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs thrashed - absolutely laced behind point for four. You just do not, and cannot, bowl short and wide - to anyone - but least of all Ponting. Least of all in a World Cup, in a crunch match - never mind on a pitch this flat. Terrible bowling"
690,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs and there's his 60th fifty from 69 balls, as he knocks this leg-side drifter down for another four"
691,"Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs pumped to Strauss at deep extra cover for a single. Oh no, Strauss makes a complete hash of it and they grab two"
692,"Mahmood to Ponting, 1 wide down the leg side and that'll be a wide"
693,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run pushed on the front foot to mid-off. A much better length here from Mahmood, albeit on a line far, far too wide once again"
694,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run again too wide, Ponting goes for it and misses"
695,"Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs on leg stump, and worked through midwicket"
696,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run a full toss which is easily worked down the ground"
697,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run better length, but it's deadened into the off side and, well, they're so quick between the wickets these two"
698,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run more milking, this time into the leg side"
699,"Panesar to Ponting, 2 runs on leg stump, Ponting sweep to fine leg and they pick up two without breaking sweat"
700,"Panesar to Ponting, no run on middle and off, attacking the stumps and it's firmly defended"
701,"Panesar to Ponting, no run ooh good ball to finish the over, Ponting pushing at it rather airily. Safely but waftily"
702,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run on off stump, pumped back to Flintoff who fields in his follow through"
703,"Flintoff to Clarke, 2 runs very wide of the off stump and Clarke easily guides it through cover, threading the gap with ease"
704,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 leg bye have some of that, umpire, Flintoff asks. But the umpire's had more than enough of it, and it's not out - drifting down leg by some distance"
705,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run ah deliciously played, late-cut down to third man"
706,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run the wrong line from Flintoff. England simply must bowl straight if they're to have half a chance in this game. It drifts down leg and is worked for a single"
707,"Flintoff to Ponting, 2 runs once again on leg, once again worked to Bopara for a couple"
708,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run tosses this up on leg stump"
709,"Panesar to Ponting, no run back onto his stumps, Ponting cuts it late but is sent back by Clarke"
710,"Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs class and elegance all combined into one wristy flick over midwicket. That's it really. Just a flick"
711,"Panesar to Ponting, no run excellent comeback from Monty, the ball holding its line and Ponting was nearly beaten in the flight"
712,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run pushed down to long-on"
713,"Panesar to Clarke, no run good length this time, but Clarke plays it late and with soft hands"
714,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run full and straight, firmly punched to midwicket"
715,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run just short enough to allow Ponting to work it down to Monty at fine leg"
716,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run ooh well bowled there, just a touch slower and it's pushed to leg"
717,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run another slower ball but Clarke waits for it and elegantly turns it to fine leg"
718,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run cracked back to Collingwood who is almost wrong-footed, but flings out his right hand to field"
719,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, FOUR runs easy, excellent batting. A touch slower and Ponting just lifts it over mid-on for another four"
720,"Panesar to Clarke, 3 runs full and wide, smashed on the front foot - just opening the face a touch - for three"
721,"Panesar to Ponting, no run not a bad shout from Monty, rapping Ponting on the pad but it's just outside the line"
722,"Panesar to Ponting, no run pushed out into the covers"
723,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run once again pushed to cover - and brilliant running hands them a single"
724,"Panesar to Clarke, no run ooh short and wide, cracked off the bat foot but straight to cover"
725,"Panesar to Clarke, 2 runs and he flicks it through midwicket for a single. Make that two - that is quite brilliant running"
726,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run too short and wide and it's driven off the back foot to mid-off"
727,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run but Collingwood manages to send it down 22 yards, but it's too short and paddled around the corner"
728,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run clumped to mid-on on the front foot"
729,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run and it's sent wider of Clarke this time who calmly times it into the covers"
730,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, FOUR runs magnificent shot. Too short, and a front-foot-hammering-pull sends it sailing past Bopara at deep midwicket"
731,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run too short once again and turned around the corner"
732,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run on leg stump and milked through midwicket"
733,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run neatly nudged to midwicket"
734,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run ooh and he runs down the pitch at Monty, sweetly timing it to cover"
735,"Panesar to Ponting, no run good length, good pace"
736,"Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs even better. Straighter this time, over long-off"
737,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run spearing down the leg side and it's worked through miidwicket"
738,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run guided on the front foot past cover"
739,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run Clarke steps outside leg, by some distance, but Flintoff follows him - cramping him for room and he smudges it around the corner"
740,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run excellent, direct, full, fast and straight delivery which is blocked out"
741,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run good bouncer, evaded relatively easily by Ponting - but, like the previous straight delivery, England just haven't been straight enough"
742,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run good start from Collingwood on middle, but Clarke's well set and strokes it through midwicket"
743,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run just wider of the crease, kissing the turf, and it's caressed into cover"
744,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run and he flirts with the idea of hitting over the top before stroking it to leg"
745,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run full and straight, smooched through midwicket"
746,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run pushed down to long-on"
747,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run Flintoff leaps into the air in appeal, but that one, although full and low and rapping Symonds, was sneaking down leg"
748,"Flintoff to Symonds, 1 leg bye caressed off the hips, literally, behind square"
749,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run driven into the covers and that's well picked up by Pietersen"
750,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run ...and Flintoff acts as the seventh, scooping that one up on the bounce off his own bowling"
751,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run worked to Vaughan at short midwicket who shapes to return it, with aggressive intent"
752,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, no run pushed right up there and that's driven into the covers"
753,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, FOUR runs Symonds goes big"
754,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, 2 runs really good effort from Pietersen that - he caught it just inside the midwicket boundary and then he keeps tiptoeing and tiptoeing inside the rope, before flicking it into space inside as he goes over. There's much discussion and referral and many many replays. But not out, in"
755,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, SIX runs slower ball and there's no doubt this time - Symonds powers that over mid-off and that's gone all the way for six, nice"
756,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, no run drives that one to cover"
757,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run pushed right up there and driven out to long-on"
758,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run outside off and that one's driven to cover"

761,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run pushed right up there and driven to long-off"
762,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run played and missed as that one came back in off the seam. Nixon spots the chance to run out Symonds who he thinks is out of his crease. He's not"
763,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run play and a miss again, that one nearly cutting him in two - not literally, of course"
764,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run top bopping from Bopara in the covers, diving round to his left to cut that one off"
765,"Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run on leg and that was driven off the legs into midwicket"
766,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run pushed right up there and dug out off the front foot to the covers"
767,"Mahmood to Clarke, FOUR runs smashed over the top, plenty of bottom hand, and that's beaten Panesar at long-off"
768,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run on leg and that's turned square"
769,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run gets some bat on that one, turned straight round to Nixon"
770,"Anderson to Clarke, no run outside off and that's played into the covers with a shuffling of the feet"
771,"Anderson to Clarke, no run up there, on off, and the batsman brings his bat and leg together in defending that one into the covers"
772,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs slight touch more width outside off and that's eased out off the back foot to the point boundary"
773,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs a bit too full from the bowler and it's timed very well to long-off to bring up his fifty from 59 balls"
774,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run bangs that one in short and that's pulled to Panesar behind square"
775,"Anderson to Symonds, 1 run outside off and that's cut away off the back foot through cover"
776,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run right up there, and that's taken off the legs into short midwicket"
777,"Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs slower ball again, Symonds dances down and that's lashed over cover for a resounding four"

779,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run on middle-and-leg and that's played out to midwicket"
780,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run driven back to the bowler"
781,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run bouncer, Symonds just ducks under it, nonchalantly as you like"
782,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs on leg and Panesar wings that back as fast as he can from the boundary, but the batsmen are quick enough to get the two, and in the end it's a comfortable two indeed"
783,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run wide outside off and that's a good shot by Clarke, leaning into it and driving it through cover"
784,"Anderson to Symonds, no run right up there and that's driven back to mid-on"
785,"Anderson to Symonds, no run pushed up there and that's driven back to the bowler"
786,"Anderson to Symonds, no run straight ball, up there, and that's driven back into the ground, Anderson picking it up on the first bounce"
787,"Anderson to Symonds, 1 run a half-volley outside off, Symonds launches into it, a lashing cover drive, but mistimes it a touch and it rolls through the covers"
788,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run great ball, a lifter surprising Symonds as it whistles past his chest, Symonds having to arc back like a snake to avoid it"
789,"Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs short ball and that's lashed through midwicket with a firmly struck pull to end the match"
790,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run over the wicket, and there's no swing on that one, neither from the ball, nor the batsman, who opts to live as it runs away down the off stick"
791,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run again no swing, that one angling flat across Gilchrist, who reaches out to defend"
792,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run more width outside off, although this was tighter on the sticks, Gilchrist leans into that one and drives straight to Bell who ends up sitting on the floor in his efforts to stop it"
793,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 bye swing at last and nearly does for Gilchrist, who steps into the shot and drives at it, but it swings a touch late and nearly takes the inside edge"
794,"Anderson to Hayden, no run scoots that one down the off-side, wide enough for Hayden to leave first up"
795,"Anderson to Hayden, no run really close - huge shouts from everyone, but Bowden shakes his head early, and firmly, that one pitches in line, straightens and would have taken off-and-middle three quarters up the sticks. Perhaps the umpire thinks he hit it, or that it pitched outside leg. It looked very close"
796,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs full toss and Gilchrist doesn't miss out - far from, in fact, leaning into that one and driving it off the bottom of the bat through cover"
797,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another huge shout, Rudi Koertzen is unmoved, and that one would have moved on to take the off stump according to HawkEye. Mahmood doesn't think so, though, nearly backing into the batsman as he moves back and back in his appeal"
798,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run dinked into the ground off the back foot and on to the man at cover"
799,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run Gilchrist doesn't get hold of that one, driving into the ground and straight to the man in short and straight on the off side"
800,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs short, on the legs, and you really can't bowl it there to him - help yourself stuff - and that pull shot nearly took out Bowden who did a last-minute shimmy at square"
801,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another drive off the back foot, he doesn't connect, and indeed it wasn't the length he was expecting - but it's certainly a signal of his attacking intent"
802,"Anderson to Hayden, no run pushed right up there and that's driven back out, without much power, to long-on"
803,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide great delivery to a righthander... unfortunately Hayden isn't, and that one slinks down leg, on a good length, but wide enough to be called so"
804,"Anderson to Hayden, no run clunk-and-run, Hayden dropping that one into the covers and they set off for a risky single, but head back"
805,"Anderson to Hayden, no run defended into the leg side"
806,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs scorching shot off a half-volley, just leant on that one on the rise and it raced away through the covers"
807,"Anderson to Hayden, no run tickled off the pads in front of short midwicket and Pietersen does very well to dive on the run, sliding to his right to pick that one up"
808,"Anderson to Hayden, no run straight and that's worked into the leg side without much fuss"
809,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pitches up and rises at the batsman who defends down off the back foot"
810,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run on off and that's driven to the man at cover"
811,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs on leg and Gilchrist is so quick to get onto that one - fast eyes, fast hands, and that's swished away off his pads through orthodox fine leg"
812,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run straight and that's worked straight to Vaughan at midwicket who picks it up and mock-shies at Gilchrist's stumps"
813,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, wide, and that's just easily left alone"
814,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run right up there, straight, and that's driven to the man straight in on the off"
815,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide comes down the track, tries to hook, and misses it completely - the ball strayghing down leg"
816,"Anderson to Hayden, no run comes forward again and drives this one to mid-on this time"
817,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs beautiful shot that one - short, and that's hit so cleanly over and in front of midwicket"
818,"Anderson to Hayden, no run pushed right up there and that's defended"
819,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide leg-side filth"
820,"Anderson to Hayden, no run played off the back foot, with a strong defence, Hayden's head behind the bat"
821,"Anderson to Hayden, no run short and that's driven to the man in at short midwicket"
822,"Anderson to Hayden, no run defended this time"
823,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, picked, and defended"
824,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run slower ball, picked again, and eased back out on the off-side with a straight bat"
825,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run on leg and that's turned away off the pads to midwicket"
826,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs on leg, and that's merely eased away through fine leg"
827,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 run driven out to long-off"
828,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 run straighter, but still a touch short, and that's eased out to midwicket"
829,"Anderson to Hayden, no run connects strongly with that one, on the back foot, and defended into the covers"
830,"Anderson to Hayden, FOUR runs steps into that powerful, well-placed drive through cover. Four all the way"
831,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pushed right up there and that's defended down off the back foot into the covers"
832,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run width, and Pietersen spares Mahmood's blushes by snapping up the ball at cover"
833,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 2 runs short and that's turned away behind square, Anderson misfielding on the backward-of-square-leg boundary"
834,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run on leg once more and that's whisked away off the hips behind square"
835,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run slower ball, outside off, and that one finds the fielder at cover"
836,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run slower ball, and that's good running from the pair, as that one's nibbled out to mid-off with a mere push"
837,"Anderson to Hayden, 1 run pushed right up there and some more good running, that one nudged towards mid-off"
838,"Anderson to Gilchrist, FOUR runs on legs and that's a piece of superb timing off the hips which races away through square"
839,"Anderson to Gilchrist, 2 runs width, and Gilchrist cover-drives"
840,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run played off the back foot to cover"
841,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run play and a miss this time, Gilchrist playing away from his body, driving to cover, but the ball shoots through"
842,"Anderson to Gilchrist, no run good ball to end the over, straighter, tucking him up for room and he defends down off the back foot"
843,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run beat short cover, and just to the left of extra-cover, who ran round and dived... Bell the fielder"
844,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run big backlift and he crashes that one to point"
845,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs slower ball that may as well have had a bell on it, width, and that's cut really well off the back foot and that's a typical Gilchrist full-throttle number"
846,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run a touch, only a touch, of room and that's a tip-and-top tip-and-run"
847,"Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run slower ball and Hayden just drops his bat onto that one, working it behind square"
848,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run straight, and that's just dibbled into short midwicket off the back foot"
849,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run ooh and immediately he induces an inside edge from Hayden's heavy-footed attempted clump through the covers"
850,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and Hayden marches down the pitch, ala Ian Bell but with great threat, but like Bell he can't make anything of it, just pushing it back to the bowler"
851,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run good line and length and Hayden guides it to gully"
852,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs that is savage. Unhindered violence from Hayden, marching down the pitch and fairly smiting the ball over midwicket which bounces once, maybe twice, before thudding into the boundary boards"
853,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run oh and he's hammered this one too through the covers, but Bell is quick to dive to his right and prevent four"
854,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run good line, but it's full enough to be driven to mid-off for a thoroughly cheeky single"
855,"Panesar to Ponting, no run on middle-and-off, good loop from Monty and it's driven back to the bowler"
856,"Panesar to Ponting, no run excellent line again - at a good, nagging pace. Not too quick. And Ponting watchfully blocks it out"
857,"Panesar to Ponting, no run again good pace - he's been too quick through the air so far in the tournament, and Ponting defends"
858,"Panesar to Ponting, no run Ponting once again forward to defend this"
859,"Panesar to Ponting, no run and just a touch tighter in line, on leg stump, and Ponting smothers the spin"
860,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run smacked to cover with immense power"
861,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run a full bunger which Hayden whacks into the ground, with intent, but it bobbles out to Vaughan at mid-off"
862,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and a huge swing-and-a-miss from Hayden who, had he connected with that, would've smacked it into another island"
863,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run touch wider of the off stump and he shoulders arms"
864,"Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs and here he goes. The chirping isn't working"
865,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run and he pushes forward, guiding it to gully"

867,"Panesar to Ponting, no run quicker and fuller"
868,"Panesar to Ponting, no run drags Ponting forward who pushes it to leg"
869,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run too short from Monty but actually he gets away with it, Ponting cracking it off the back foot but straight to cover and they pick up just a single"
870,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run easily worked to mid-off for another single"
871,"Panesar to Ponting, no run good line outside off, on a good length too and it's guided off the face of the bat into the off side"
872,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run no great pace from Flintoff there, but it's a good line and worked into the covers"
873,"Flintoff to Hayden, no run Hayden comes ominously down the pitch, making it into a full bunger but Hayden can't bisect the gap in the covers"
874,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run solidly forward, easing this behind square"
875,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run another full toss - we've seen a dozen or so of those today - and Ponting just whips it through midwicket with a flash of the wrists"
876,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run that's an excellent piece of cricket, of awareness by the two batsman. Wide of the crease from Flintoff, and Hayden uses the angle to guide it down to Monty at third man. Aware of his weak throw, they steal a single"
877,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run bat-padded out into the off side"
878,"Panesar to Hayden, no run and the big, tall left hander is watchful in defence"
879,"Panesar to Hayden, 2 runs less watchful this time, just angling this to a short third man"
880,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run and again it's wide enough for Hayden to snick it down to a short third man who, to his credit, is quick to skip across - but Ponting is quicker, and sprints through for a single"
881,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run Ponting skips down the pitch but is almost beaten in the flight, and is saved by bat-padding it away"
882,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run nudged to the leg side, and another single is milked"
883,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run swept down to short fine leg, and another piece of excellent running between the wickets grabs them another single"
884,"Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs oh that's immensely bad luck for old Flintoff, Ponting driving on the up and very nearly chopping it on. Nixon hasn't a hope and it flies down for four"
885,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run pushed without great timing to Anderson at mid-off. Ponting wants two"
886,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run a full toss which Hayden pumps to Anderson again"
887,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run beautifully stroked but straight to the Sherminator, Ian Bell, at cover"
888,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run nearly! Flintoff sent it a foot wider"
889,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run on-driven but again Ponting can't place it, and it's smudged to mid-on"
890,"Panesar to Hayden, no run good line, on middle-and-off and quick enough to force Hayden's defence"
891,"Panesar to Hayden, 1 run just outside the off stump and, this time, a little shorter allowing Hayden to guide it down to third man"
892,"Panesar to Ponting, no run wide of the off stump, crashed to mid-off"
893,"Panesar to Ponting, no run ooh and he sweeps a flatter delivery, a straighter delivery too but no run on offer there"
894,"Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs well, that's just effortless frankly. Not a very good ball, not turning enough and it's delightfully cracked over mid-off for four"
895,"Panesar to Ponting, no run drags Ponting forward here, nice bit of turn and he smothers it cautiously. Good comeback from Monty"
896,"Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run full and straight - too full, in fact - and Hayden drives with a crack of the bat to mid-off for a single"
897,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run ah, superbly cut - a late-cut off a fast bowler - but straight to point"
898,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run straighter delivery this time, and Ponting bat-pads it into the covers"
899,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run again it's watchfully defended by Ponting to a ball just outside his off stump. Good, nagging line this"
900,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run good line again, and Ponting refuses to be tempted into driving"
901,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run a huge appeal from Flintoff who is absolutely convinced he has Ponting leg before, but replays indicate the ball was just going over the top. And he was outside the line, too. Not out, then"
902,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run good start to Clarke, just on off stump and cutting back into him a touch. Pushed out into the covers"
903,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run pushed to Strauss at mid-on - oh, who fumbles pathetically. Schoolboy error there and Clarke's off the mark"
904,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run ooh and that swings in a touch to Ponting"
905,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run flicked to midwicket, but he can't bisect the gap"

907,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run outside off and that's driven to mid-on"
908,"Flintoff to Ponting, no run pushed up there outside off and that was driven down off the back foot to cover"
909,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run quickly single to mid-on, good scampering there, like that"
910,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run on a good line and length, and that one is just fended into the covers"
911,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run squeezed into the leg-side from off on the front foot and there's some good communication from the pair"
912,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run pushed right up there and that's pushed again into the covers"
913,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run no great pace, of course, but he places that one on a good length and Ponting can't get it away"
914,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run again on an awkward length, just tucking Ponting up on line with off, and he fends down"
915,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run width this time and Ponting should have cashed in. Instead, he short changes himself with a drive straight to cover"

917,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run good line this time, on off, but drags it a touch short and that's driven to mid-on"

920,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run outside off and that's worked well into the covers and there's some good quick running"

922,"Anderson to Clarke, no run on leg and that's driven in front of midwicket"
923,"Anderson to Clarke, no run driven out into short midwicket"

926,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run up there and that's defended on the back foot"
927,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run single to Strauss at mid-on, again risky, but in fact he would have been back comfortably"
928,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run Ponting pierces the leg-side with a punt off his legs"

931,"Anderson to Ponting, no run thinks about driving that one on the up, but in the end he has to defend"

936,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run took the pace off that one and it's defended forward"
937,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run great drift in the air, reversing back in to the batsman who does well to get some bat on it"
938,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 3 runs driven forward and there's a misfield through cover. Panesar does well to stop it just inside the rope"

940,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run drifted back into the righthander and that's driven out to the cover boundary"

942,"Anderson to Ponting, no run driven out to point"

944,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run short and pulled from outside off in front of midwicket"
945,"Anderson to Clarke, 1 run straight, but Clarke's ready for that, and he works it in front of square and they run through very quickly"
946,"Anderson to Ponting, 1 run played behind square and Panesar does well behind square on the boundary... ah, deep backward square leg, that will be it"
947,"Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs driven out to the cover boundary and there's an easy two"
948,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, FOUR runs waited and waited and flicked it with his wrists down to fine leg. The ball wheezes over the line in the end, much like a marathon runner"
949,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run defended down off the back foot this time"
950,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run a hint of inswing there and Ponting plays that into his leg"
951,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 wide an attempted stumping from an off-side wide. A bit harsh the wide, you'd suspect, but no doubt on the fact that Ponting's foot was firmly grounded"
952,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs well swished off the hips but there's some great teamwork on the boundary, Anderson sliding to keep the ball in and Pietersen winging it back"

957,"Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run driven through cover"
958,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run driven forward back to the bowler, who can't get a hand on it, and the mid-off does the tidying up"
959,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs just leans into that one and times it off the bottom of the bat through cover"
960,"Panesar to Clarke, no run driven back to Panesar who stifles the ball like a groping puppy. Good stifling"

965,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run this one's driven to cover"
966,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs thrashed - absolutely laced behind point for four. You just do not, and cannot, bowl short and wide - to anyone - but least of all Ponting. Least of all in a World Cup, in a crunch match - never mind on a pitch this flat. Terrible bowling"
967,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs and there's his 60th fifty from 69 balls, as he knocks this leg-side drifter down for another four"
968,"Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs pumped to Strauss at deep extra cover for a single. Oh no, Strauss makes a complete hash of it and they grab two"
969,"Mahmood to Ponting, 1 wide down the leg side and that'll be a wide"
970,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run pushed on the front foot to mid-off. A much better length here from Mahmood, albeit on a line far, far too wide once again"

972,"Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs on leg stump, and worked through midwicket"
973,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run a full toss which is easily worked down the ground"
974,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run better length, but it's deadened into the off side and, well, they're so quick between the wickets these two"
975,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run more milking, this time into the leg side"
976,"Panesar to Ponting, 2 runs on leg stump, Ponting sweep to fine leg and they pick up two without breaking sweat"
977,"Panesar to Ponting, no run on middle and off, attacking the stumps and it's firmly defended"
978,"Panesar to Ponting, no run ooh good ball to finish the over, Ponting pushing at it rather airily. Safely but waftily"
979,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run on off stump, pumped back to Flintoff who fields in his follow through"
980,"Flintoff to Clarke, 2 runs very wide of the off stump and Clarke easily guides it through cover, threading the gap with ease"
981,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 leg bye have some of that, umpire, Flintoff asks. But the umpire's had more than enough of it, and it's not out - drifting down leg by some distance"
982,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run ah deliciously played, late-cut down to third man"
983,"Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run the wrong line from Flintoff. England simply must bowl straight if they're to have half a chance in this game. It drifts down leg and is worked for a single"

989,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run pushed down to long-on"
990,"Panesar to Clarke, no run good length this time, but Clarke plays it late and with soft hands"
991,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run full and straight, firmly punched to midwicket"
992,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run just short enough to allow Ponting to work it down to Monty at fine leg"
993,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run ooh well bowled there, just a touch slower and it's pushed to leg"
994,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run another slower ball but Clarke waits for it and elegantly turns it to fine leg"
995,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run cracked back to Collingwood who is almost wrong-footed, but flings out his right hand to field"
996,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, FOUR runs easy, excellent batting. A touch slower and Ponting just lifts it over mid-on for another four"
997,"Panesar to Clarke, 3 runs full and wide, smashed on the front foot - just opening the face a touch - for three"

1006,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run and it's sent wider of Clarke this time who calmly times it into the covers"
1007,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, FOUR runs magnificent shot. Too short, and a front-foot-hammering-pull sends it sailing past Bopara at deep midwicket"
1008,"PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run too short once again and turned around the corner"
1009,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run on leg stump and milked through midwicket"
1010,"Panesar to Ponting, 1 run neatly nudged to midwicket"
1011,"Panesar to Clarke, 1 run ooh and he runs down the pitch at Monty, sweetly timing it to cover"

1015,"Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run guided on the front foot past cover"

1023,"PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run pushed down to long-on"
1024,"Flintoff to Symonds, no run Flintoff leaps into the air in appeal, but that one, although full and low and rapping Symonds, was sneaking down leg"
1025,"Flintoff to Symonds, 1 leg bye caressed off the hips, literally, behind square"
1026,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run driven into the covers and that's well picked up by Pietersen"
1027,"Flintoff to Clarke, no run ...and Flintoff acts as the seventh, scooping that one up on the bounce off his own bowling"

1030,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, FOUR runs Symonds goes big"
1031,"PD Collingwood to Symonds, 2 runs really good effort from Pietersen that - he caught it just inside the midwicket boundary and then he keeps tiptoeing and tiptoeing inside the rope, before flicking it into space inside as he goes over. There's much discussion and referral and many many replays. But not out, in"

1065,"Mahmood to Symonds, no run great ball, a lifter surprising Symonds as it whistles past his chest, Symonds having to arc back like a snake to avoid it"
1066,"Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs short ball and that's lashed through midwicket with a firmly struck pull to end the match"
1067,"Well played Australia, they deserved that victory - good captaincy from Ponting to apply the squeeze once Pietersen and Bell had got them into a decent position in England's innings. Another victory for Australia, then, the deserved favourites, and that's 18 straight World Cup wins for them. Take that. England, meanw"
