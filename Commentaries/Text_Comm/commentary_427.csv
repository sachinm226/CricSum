0,1.50pm Andrew Strauss has won the toss and sent Australia in to bat.
1,"Shahzad to Watson, no run a little bit of swing in to Watson, who leaves it outside off"
2,"Shahzad to Watson, no run right on target now, and Watson gets forward to defend"
3,"Shahzad to Watson, no run again Watson goes with the straight bat, watchfully, as Shahzad angles in to off stump"
4,"Shahzad to Watson, no run some swing away from the batsman now, and it's left to go through to Matt Prior"
5,"Shahzad to Watson, no run banged in short of a length and it's moving in to Watson, who leaves it alone"
6,"Shahzad to Watson, no run fuller and straighter, Watson drives clunkily to mid-on and can't find the gap"
7,"Tremlett to Haddin, 1 leg bye the first run is on the board, and it's a leg-bye off the thigh away behind square as Tremlett bowls a little too straight"
8,"Tremlett to Watson, no run better line now and Watson drives, uppishly as this ball doesn't come on as quick as he expected, and it's collected at mid-on"
9,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Watson tries to guide this one down past the two slips, but it's collected on the bounce at second slip"
10,"Tremlett to Watson, no run banged in short of a length, Watson pushes to point, he's being extra cautious out there"
11,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run Watson gets off the mark now with a single, just guided into the ground and behind point"
12,"Tremlett to Haddin, no run oh, you could have driven a small car through that gap between bat and pad, as Haddin drives waftily and Tremlett nips the ball back in through the gate - Haddin's lucky to survive that"
13,"Shahzad to Watson, FOUR runs there's the first boundary of the day, but it wasn't exactly off the middle as Watson drove uppishly just wide of mid-off, it evaded the fielder and ran away safely"
14,"Shahzad to Watson, no run left alone as this one nips back in and sails over the stumps"
15,"Shahzad to Watson, no run bouncer and Watson swings wildy! He's tried to pull that, with so much effort that he's lucky not to have thrown his back out. In any case, the ball bounced more than he expected and sailed through to Prior"
16,"Shahzad to Watson, no run jags back in off the seam and Watson gets an inside edge on to the pads"
17,"Shahzad to Watson, no run Shahzad is getting good bounce here, and this one is cut by Watson close to his body, into the ground and straight to point"
18,"Shahzad to Watson, OUT gone! Shahzad deserved that wicket, he'd been getting them nip back off the seam and this one does the same, Watson tries to open the face and run it to third man but only succeeds in playing on to his off stump"
19,"Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run Haddin faces his third ball and works a single off his hips to square leg"
20,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run wide of off and swinging away, Clarke leaves it alone"
21,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run straighter now and Clarke pushes defensively to cover"
22,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run good line right on off stump and straightening, Clarke gets it away to point"
23,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run Clarke gets across and punches to the off side, doesn't quite time it"
24,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run and Clarke is off the mark with a hurried single as he pushes just wide of mid on"
25,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run defended edgily back down the pitch"
26,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run good bounce and carry through to Prior as it's left alone outside off"
27,"Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run nipping back in again and it's short of a length, Clarke thrusts the bat forward and gets a single off the inside edge away through square leg"
28,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run bouncer and Prior does well to take that one. That was above head height, I think Shahzad is lucky that wasn't called a wide"
29,"Shahzad to Haddin, 2 runs wider of off now and Haddin opens the face to guide this one through gully, and third man runs around to do the fielding"
30,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin's had enough of being careful, he backs away and tries to drive down through cover but just finds mid off"
31,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run that's a wonderful delivery from Tremlett, it angles back in and then moves away off the seam, thoroughly beating the straight bat of Clarke"
32,"Tremlett to Clarke, 2 runs good running now as Clarke gets one through square leg and puts the pressure on the fielder to get back for two"
33,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run straight-bat defence this time from Clarke"
34,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run pushed away off the back foot to cover"
35,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run short of a length again, and it's pushed away to midwicket"
36,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run again it's a good ball probing outside off, and it's pushed to cover"
37,"Shahzad to Haddin, 2 runs Haddin works this one with the angle through midwicket, just finds the gap nicely"
38,"Shahzad to Haddin, OUT Shahzad gets another one! Again he nips the ball back in, and Haddin drives at it, gets a thin edge back in on to his stumps and the seam movement has now done for both openers"
39,"Shahzad to White, no run fullish ball and White keeps it out"
40,"Shahzad to White, no run pushed back down past the bowler to mid-on"
41,"Shahzad to White, no run probing outside off, White gets across with a big stride and defends"
42,"Shahzad to White, no run bouncer! And it's quick, straight, and probably just a touch too high to really threaten White, who goes for the hook but can't connect"
43,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run left alone outside off"
44,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run straighter line now and Clarke nudges a single wide of mid-on"
45,"Tremlett to White, no run White pushes this one to off, good consistent lines from Tremlett"
46,"Tremlett to White, no run yeee-ouch! Tremlett uses his height to bang this one in short and White tries to defend, but cops it on the right hand, yanking it off the bat and takes the glove off immediately. The physio comes out to have a look. And for some reason Kevin Pietersen is supervising, patting White on the shoulder."
47,"Tremlett to White, no run pushed out to the off side and can't find the gap"
48,"Tremlett to White, no run on the back foot, White defends"
49,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run pushed away to the off side"
50,"Shahzad to Clarke, FOUR runs well played by Clarke, he's used his feet here to walk down the pitch and across outside off, and lifts this ball over wide midwicket, safely and timed well enough to reach the boundary"
51,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run slower ball now and it's left alone outside off"
52,"Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run punched off the back foot wide of cover and Clarke finds a single"
53,"Shahzad to White, no run White hangs the bat out at this one and defends to cover"
54,"Shahzad to White, no run and this one is left alone"
55,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run good line to start with, right on off stump, and it's defended"
56,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run pulled away to midwicket but can't find the gap"
57,"Bresnan to Clarke, OUT ooooh dear! Clarke has not capitalised on his start. He's chased a wide one, which was there to be hit, but he's cut it straight to Bell who is just forward of point, what a disappointing end for the stand-in captain"
58,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run pushed away defensively to off"
59,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run good ball swinging back in and Hussey doesn't get the bat on that, takes it on the pad"
60,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run defended to the off side again"
61,"Shahzad to White, 1 wide bad ball, way down leg side and there's no doubt that's a wide"
62,"Shahzad to White, 1 run driven just wide of mid-off to get a single"
63,"Shahzad to Hussey, 1 run thickish inside edge gets Hussey off the mark through square leg and that's his first ODI run since August 2009"
64,"Shahzad to White, no run yorker but it's not on line, and White pushes to point"
65,"Shahzad to White, no run there's an appeal now as White pushes outside off and the ball is taken by Prior, but Tony Hill isn't interested and it didn't look like an edge at first view - replays confirm bat hit pad"
66,"Shahzad to White, 1 run White throws the bat now as he gets a wider and fuller one, getting it uppishly to third man and it's collected inside the boundary"
67,"Shahzad to Hussey, FOUR runs oh good shot! Short and wide, as was the ball that did for Clarke, but David Hussey cuts deliberately high over point and bounces that one safely away to the boundary"
68,"Bresnan to White, no run angled in to White, who pushes to the leg side"
69,"Bresnan to White, no run nudged away to point and White thinks of a single until Hussey roars a 'nooooo!'"
70,"Bresnan to White, no run defended back down the pitch"
71,"Bresnan to White, 1 run driven off the back foot and White didn't quite control that, edging it through the vacant gully region and way to third man"
72,"Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs that's a pull that you'd probably short-arm jab, as Hussey just slaps it through midwicket but doesn't quite time it"
73,"Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run another run for Hussey, who clips it off his pads through square leg"
74,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run left alone outside off"
75,"Tremlett to Hussey, no run well wide of off and Hussey leaves it"
76,"Tremlett to Hussey, OUT And another bites the dust! Tremlett probes outside off and gets one to seam away a touch, Hussey pushes off the back foot but straight to Strauss at gully, and he takes a good catch"
77,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run Marsh gets off the mark with a flick off his pads through square leg"
78,"Tremlett to White, no run White watches this one through to Prior as it moves away off the seam"
79,"Tremlett to White, no run nudged towards the leg side"
80,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run a stifled lbw shout here but that was clearly pitching a long way outside leg"
81,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run fullish and straight, and Marsh pushes back to the bowler"
82,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run clipped away through midwicket as Bresnan again bowls a touch too straight"
83,"Bresnan to White, no run bouncer, and White ducks under it - that's another one that is lucky not to have been called a wide"
84,"Bresnan to White, no run pushed to short cover and can't beat the field"
85,"Bresnan to White, no run oooh, White slashes at one wide of off and tries to cut hard, but it bounces more than expected and is taken by Prior"
86,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run fullish and swinging back down the line, Marsh defends"
87,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run on the hips, Marsh works it behind square and Matt Prior bolts across to do the fielding and ensures that is only a single"
88,"Tremlett to White, no run clunked away to mid-off"
89,"Tremlett to White, 1 run oh, here's a chance, White pulls and top edges high - high - high - and out to square leg, Prior races across and tries to make the ground, hurls himself at the last moment but falls a few inches short of getting his gloves on it. Perhaps he could have left that for fine leg or midwicket running around, but it was"
90,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run defended back down the pitch"
91,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run defended away safely by Marsh"
92,"Bresnan to White, 1 run nudged away off the pads through square leg"
93,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run Marsh cuts into the ground and straight to point"
94,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run on the pads and Marsh defends"
95,"Bresnan to Marsh, 2 runs cuts this one fine, getting it away to third man to pick up two runs"
96,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run England continue to target Marsh's pads and body - he pulls this one into the ground and behind square"
97,"Bresnan to White, no run pushed back down the pitch defensively"
98,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run right, no coverage for that delivery so I can't tell you what happened"
99,"Tremlett to White, 1 run Tremlett pings another down from 12 ft, hitting back of a length and White finds an inside edge that squirts down to midwicket"
100,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run England trying to tuck Marsh up, giving him no room outside off and this is defended back to the bowler"
101,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 wide Tremlett goes too far on the tuck-him-up approach and slides this down the leg side"
102,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run this is outside off stump but Marsh lets it go by for Australia's 71st dot ball"
103,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run dot ball to finish another good over. Good effort from Tremlett to respond from World Cup disappointment with a spell like this"
104,"Bresnan to White, no run Bresnan has been fuller than Tremlett, suits him better and he lands this around off stump on a length, White eases forward to block"
105,"Bresnan to White, no run ripper! Pitches on a length and skids away, White's feet are rooted and it climbs past the outside edge"
106,"Bresnan to White, 2 runs good running earns a couple here, White glancing towards deep square and sprinting hard to come back for the second"
107,"Bresnan to White, 1 run a misfield! Don't see many from England. Bell is the villain, diving over the ball at short cover to gift a single"
108,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 wide banged in very short, Marsh thinks about a hook before deciding against it. The ball swerves late on Prior who has to dive to collect well"
109,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 leg bye Bresnan reverts to a fuller length, angling into the hips and Marsh shoves it into the leg side"
110,"Bresnan to White, 1 run worked away for another single towards square leg"
111,"Trott to White, no run starts with a gentle, wobbling medium-pacer aiming for around off stump. White defends rather respectfully"
112,"Trott to White, 2 runs no more respect from White! He aims an almighty drive down-town, as Australians like to say, didn't get much of it and it went very high, Tremlett hared after it but couldn't quite catch up"
113,"Trott to White, no run this time it's back to careful defence"
114,"Trott to White, no run White aims a mow. Horrid shot really, flat-footed swipe. He momentarily dragged his foot out before grounding it back in the crease. Prior had the bails off to all sorts of excitement but the third umpire confirmed White was home"
115,"Trott to White, FOUR runs finally White gets hold of one. I don't think he can stomach the prospect of Trott trundling in and bowling dot balls so aims a well-timed lofted drive well over mid-on for four"
116,"Trott to White, no run satisfied with his boundary White is happy to nudge this into the leg side. He might have combusted if he didn't get one away off Trott"
117,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run starts accurately, no great turn or bite, but straight and defended"
118,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run Marsh edges down the wicket and blocks towards Pietersen, who fumbled at point"
119,"Tredwell to Marsh, 2 runs neatly swept away behind square for a couple"
120,"Tredwell to Marsh, FOUR runs lovely shot, minimal effort just good footwork to get to the pitch and chip into the straight midwicket region for four"
121,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run now eased down the ground for a single and the game suddenly seems so much easier for the batsmen"
122,"Tredwell to White, no run good finish to the over for Tredwell, rolling it down on a sensible length and line and it's patted back to him. Sensible seems the word for Tredwell"
123,"Trott to White, 1 run White's bat is looking a touch broader now and he full-faces this down the ground"
124,"Trott to Marsh, 1 run a hint of width means Marsh can open the face and run this down to third man"
125,"Trott to White, no run Trott finds a straight line and good length. White steps forward to defend"
126,"Trott to White, no run more good lengths and lines from Trott. White picks out Strauss with a leg-side nudge"
127,"Trott to White, 1 run White has seen enough so aims a drive here, timing it not quite perfectly but well enough to pick a single down to long-on"
128,"Tredwell to White, no run hint of spin here as Tredwell rolls it down on a length, it unnerves White a touch in defence"
129,"Tredwell to White, 1 run more secure for White this time, easing down to long-on"
130,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run good line and length from Tredwell, nothing more or less than that and Marsh blocks"
131,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run fuller and Marsh squeezed out a well-timed sweep for a single"
132,"Tredwell to White, no run Tredwell holds this back a touch and White has plenty of time to aim a cut, too much time in fact and he mistimes it"
133,"Tredwell to White, no run ooh, looked a good shout as White misses an attempted sweep. Probably hit outside the line. England opted not to review"
134,"Trott to Marsh, 1 run worked away into space for a single"
135,"Trott to White, 2 runs full-faced chip-drive from White, clearing the infield to take a couple"
136,"Trott to White, 1 run touch leg-sided from Trott allows White to lean this into the midwicket region. Steady flow of runs since the quicks left the attack"
137,"Trott to Marsh, 1 run Marsh drops this to cover, jogs a single. Simple when you know how"
138,"Trott to White, no run Trott is rewarded for a good length and line, cutting his fingers across the ball, with a forward block"
139,"Trott to White, 1 run soft hands is not something you think of when talking about White but this was rather delicately placed behind square on the leg side for a strike-stealing single"
140,"Tredwell to White, no run patted back to Tredwell"
141,"Tredwell to White, FOUR runs aimed wide of off but White was on the move, heading even further outside off to hammer a sweep fine of deep square for four"
142,"Tredwell to White, 1 run White gets deep into his crease to punch a drive wide of extra cover for one"
143,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run Marsh gets a single with a well-timed cut, with help from point who dived over the ball"
144,"Tredwell to White, 1 run another delicate touch from White, uses the slightest hint of width to run a back-cut to third man. Fancy shot for one"
145,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run fifty stand! Good one, too. Marsh pushes this towards point, steals the single. No fuss at all just careful batting"
146,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run hint of air here actually, fullish length, Marsh works it into the leg side"
147,"Yardy to White, 1 run starts a touch too short to the right hander and White picks out point with a cut. Trott threw it back poorly to Prior who couldn't take it and allowed an overthrow"
148,"Yardy to Marsh, no run this time it's worked back to the bowler"
149,"Yardy to Marsh, no run Marsh aims a booming sweep but can't get hold of it and finds short fine leg"
150,"Yardy to Marsh, no run classic Yardy. Not a category to fill DVD shops, but still, angled in and cramping Marsh for room on the cut"
151,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run this time Marsh earns a single, picking this off into space"
152,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run big shot from Marsh brings a big shout from Prior! Marsh edged down the wicket to drive expansively, some spin took it past the outside edge and Prior had the bails off in a flash. Marsh though, was equally swift in getting his back foot back and it looks very tight. Marsh gets the benefit of the doubt"
153,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run after all that fuss this is driven firmly back down the ground for one"
154,"Tredwell to White, 1 run touch too short from Tredwell but it's sticking in the pitch and White has to heave his cut shot, means the timing isn't ideal so it's just a single to deep point"
155,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run Marsh picks a gap at cover with the softest of hands. These two looking in good order now"
156,"Tredwell to White, no run big gap either side of Bell at short midwicket but White's leg-side nurdle finds the man"
157,"Tredwell to White, no run hint of turn and extra bounce keeps White careful as he works this to Bell again at short midwicket"
158,"Yardy to Marsh, no run Yardy darts this in full and straight and Marsh can't get the single he wants"
159,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run this time it is worked wide of midwicket for a jogged single"
160,"Yardy to White, 1 run White looking to give himself room, Yardy doesn't let him so it's worked to leg for one"
161,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run another single as Marsh sweeps powerfully"
162,"Yardy to White, no run again White wants room to bang over cover, but Yardy is following him, taking pace off the ball and White has to force a back-foot drive to cover"
163,"Yardy to White, 1 run same set up as last delivery really, intriguing little battle, White this time gets a single down to long-off with his back-foot drive"
164,"Tredwell to White, 1 run White gets deep into his crease to really heave a cut shot, all for a single to deep point"
165,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run Tredwell holds this back a touch and Marsh has to wait and wait before turning to leg"
166,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run this time he gets a single, picking off into space"
167,"Tredwell to White, 1 run White pushes down the ground, no fuss, but a very safe single"
168,"Tredwell to Marsh, FOUR runs ah, lovely shot. Marsh got all of this. Down on one knee and sweeping very hard into a gap wide of deep square"
169,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run follows up the boundary with a strike-stealing single. Good work from Marsh he's looked a notch above all the other Australian batsmen today"
170,"Yardy to Marsh, FOUR runs another excellent Marsh boundary. Gets deep into his crease and outside leg to time a cut shot wonderfully to the point boundary"
171,"Yardy to Marsh, no run nothing on offer here as Yardy gets his line tighter to off"
172,"Yardy to Marsh, no run fired in on a length and line and patted to midwicket"
173,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run Marsh earns a single this time pushing down the ground"
174,"Yardy to White, 1 run White trades another single, gently patted to long-on"
175,"Yardy to Marsh, FOUR runs fraction short from Yardy and Marsh has all of it! Gets back, picks the gap he wants wide of long-on and smashes a pull shot straight into that area. Really good stuff from Marsh"
176,"Tredwell to White, 1 run White does the sensible thing and pats a single into space to bring Marsh back on strike"
177,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run Marsh down the wicket but blocks back to the bowler"
178,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run Marsh wants a single at least every ball and he happily pushes this down the ground for one"
179,"Tredwell to White, 1 run White repeats the dose, driving carefully down to long-on"
180,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run Tredwell tosses this up a fraction and is rewarded with a respectful block"
181,"Tredwell to Marsh, 3 runs even the edges working for Marsh now. This squirts off the outside edge down past short third man for three"
182,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run full-faced guide past the bowler"
183,"Yardy to White, 1 run flick of the wrists earns White a single towards square leg"
184,"Yardy to Marsh, no run fuller and quicker from Yardy, Marsh jabs a defence down on time"
185,"Yardy to Marsh, no run ooh, Marsh aims a nothing sort of dab cut that almost cannons onto the stumps, bounces over, hits Prior's gloves and bobbles onto the stumps. Creating all kinds of confusion"
186,"Yardy to Marsh, no run tossed up this time and defended"
187,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run carefully angled away square on the off side"
188,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run starts very well, bang on target. Marsh has to hurry forward into a defence"
189,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run good energy from Shahzad already, finding extra bounce from a length that jars the splice as Marsh defends"
190,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run well played here, Marsh uses the fraction of width to angle this to third man"
191,"Shahzad to White, no run straight onto the ideal off-stump line to the right-hander this time. White securely behind it to defend"
192,"Shahzad to White, 1 run too much width allows White to free his arms with a back-foot drive, only earns a single but he's a good wingman for Marsh at the moment"
193,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide oops, Shahzad gets his line wrong, slipping down the leg side"
194,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide and again! The crowd love it, which is a sign of the times. Shoved down the leg side again"
195,"Shahzad to Marsh, 2 runs fifty for Marsh! Now the crowd have something to cheer about. Gets there in style too, clipping off his legs for a couple. Crucial fifty that off 64 deliveries"
196,"Yardy to White, no run slow and loopy from Yardy, which is rare. Marsh defends carefully"
197,"Yardy to White, 1 wide White lines up a reverse-sweep, Yardy responds by shoving it too far down the leg side"
198,"Yardy to White, no run blocked carefully off the back foot to cover"

200,"Yardy to Marsh, 1 run Marsh down the wicket now, picking off a single to long-on"
201,"Yardy to White, FOUR runs ah this is a wonderful, wonderful shot. Easing down the track and rather than smack it, White picked out a gap wide of long-off and timed it away for four"
202,"Yardy to White, OUT Yardy strikes, soft dismissal that. Held back and tossed up from the bowler, White was a touch early on a drive but rather than go through with the shot he checked it, chipped it back wide of Yardy who dived smartly to his left to take the catch. England really needed that"
203,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run this hurries Marsh in defence here, thudding into the pads"
204,"Shahzad to Marsh, 2 runs eep, all the England supporters gasp as Tremlett dives to field smartly on the fine-leg boundary. Not a natural but good work to save a boundary as Marsh clipped off his pads"
205,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run Shahzad around the wicket and finds an inside edge that bobbles off the body and Smith calls through a swift single"
206,"Shahzad to Smith, no run ooh, Smith plays back to a full ball, gets into a strange position but defends well"
207,"Shahzad to Smith, OUT another drag-on! Smith departs. Awful shot. Feet stuck in place and aiming a booming drive well wide of off, comes off the inside edge and cannons onto the stumps"
208,"Shahzad to Hauritz, 1 run starts with a thick outside edge that goes well wide of the newly-installed slip"
209,"Yardy to Hauritz, no run Hauritz has to stay with Marsh here and starts well enough by defending back to the bowler"
210,"Yardy to Hauritz, no run worked back to the bowler again"
211,"Yardy to Hauritz, 1 run this time Yardy gets a single, picking off into space on the leg side"
212,"Yardy to Marsh, no run Marsh stands tall to pat a defence towards midwicket"

215,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run Marsh defends back down the pitch"
216,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run flicked away off the pads"
217,"Bresnan to Hauritz, OUT and Australia's downward spiral continues. Hauritz has just tried to flick this uppishly over square leg but gets it too high and Trott running around from fine leg has time to make his ground and slides to take a very good catch, nearly face-planting in the process"
218,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run on the pads, can't quite get it away"
219,"Bresnan to Marsh, 2 runs short and wide, Marsh cuts hard and forward of point, that's a very good shot but Pietersen in the deep runs around to make a terrific save on the boundary"
220,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run defended back down the pitch"
221,"Yardy to Lee, no run Lee on the back foot defends back towards Yardy"
222,"Yardy to Lee, no run worked away to midwicket"
223,"Yardy to Lee, no run down leg side and Lee pulls, but there's a short fine leg who saves the single"
224,"Yardy to Lee, no run Lee leans forward to defend"
225,"Yardy to Lee, OUT gone! Yardy strikes, and this one simply moves on with the arm, a bit quicker and Lee plays all around it, trying to guide it through the slips. The ball crashes into off stump, and Australia crash towards an extremely disappointing total."
226,"Yardy to Bollinger, no run there's a confident lbw shout immediately, but it's turned down by Tony Hill and Strauss decides against a review"
227,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run on the hips, but Marsh can't get it away"
228,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run full and straight, Marsh clips it to long-on and can't get back for a second, so Dougie has to face up now"
229,"Tremlett to Bollinger, 1 run Bollinger's off the mark, he clunks one into the ground and it drops at his feet, Marsh calls him through for a quick single"
230,"Tremlett to Marsh, no run slower ball, good variation as it wasn't that much slower at 124kph, and Marsh could only bunt back down the pitch"
231,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run on the pads again, Marsh clips it through midwicket for a single"
232,"Tremlett to Bollinger, 2 runs almost yorker length now and Bollinger does really well to push that back past the bowler, and hits it well enough to get back for two, to ensure Marsh has the strike"
233,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide wide down leg side to start with, and Marsh lets it through to Prior"
234,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run pushed back down the pitch"
235,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide aaah, another wide down leg side, Shahzad hasn't got his line right in this over"
236,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run better line now as it's full and straight, Marsh gets an inside edge onto the pad and it runs along the ground to Prior"
237,"Shahzad to Marsh, no run ooh, Shahzad has dropped a tough return chance! Marsh drove it hard back at the bowler, who thrust his right hand out and couldn't hold on - not an easy one by any means but had that stuck it would have been massive trouble for Australia"
238,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run Marsh cuts hard to point and they come through for a hesitant single, Morgan's throw at the bowler's end isn't accurate enough"
239,"Shahzad to Bollinger, no run pushed to the off side"
240,"Shahzad to Bollinger, no run thwacked into the pitch and back at the bowler! Dougie gets it off the middle, but Shahzad deflects the ball to mid-off and prevents a run"
241,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run swinging down the leg side, Marsh clips it fine but it's picked up by Shahzad at fine leg"
242,"Tremlett to Bollinger, no run oh, Dougie, what are you doing? He's pushed it straight to gully and taken off for a run, sensibly sent back by Marsh, and the throw from gully missed but Bollinger was in trouble had it hit"
243,"Tremlett to Bollinger, no run beats the bat now, as he tries to force it through cover"
244,"Tremlett to Bollinger, 1 run pushed out through wide mid-off for a single"
245,"Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run again Tremlett aims at the pads of Marsh, who flicks through square leg"
246,"Tremlett to Bollinger, 2 runs Bollinger throws everything at a pull and slaps it behind square, wide enough of fine leg that he can scurry back for a well-judged second run"
247,"Yardy to Bollinger, 1 run tossed up on middle stump and Bollinger jams a drive back down to long-on"
248,"Yardy to Marsh, 3 runs quicker and flatter and Marsh has done really well to cut that fine and out of reach of the backward point, but the slide from the man in the deep keeps that to three"
249,"Yardy to Bollinger, 1 run Bollinger advances and smashes it on the bounce to long on"
250,"Yardy to Marsh, FOUR runs oh yes! That's class from Marsh as he lifts Yardy over wide midwicket, and the most impressive thing about that is his placement, there's nobody in the deep there so it's a safe shot"
251,"Yardy to Marsh, FOUR runs another boundary and Marsh moves to 95! He's slog swept that one with power, just wide of the man in the deep and it bounces over the rope"
252,"Yardy to Marsh, SIX runs Marsh brings up his century with a six! Oh, what a moment for Marsh! He's launched a big slog sweep high, really high and for a moment it seemed it was going to fall short, but the man at deep wide midwicket backed back and tripped over the rope as that ball landed safely a couple of metres over the boundary"
253,"Bresnan to Bollinger, no run punched back down towards mid off"
254,"Bresnan to Bollinger, no run Bollinger backs away and tries to slap it through cover, can't connect"
255,"Bresnan to Bollinger, 1 run nudged back past the bowler for a quick single, good, sensible stuff from Bollinger"
256,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run good yorker from Bresnan, and Marsh keeps it out"
257,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run full toss on the leg side, Marsh works it to square leg but can't get a run - a run-out chance is missed as Bollinger sent Marsh back"
258,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run on the stumps now and Marsh pushes to cover to keep the strike"
259,"Shahzad to Marsh, FOUR runs and there's a boundary, we haven't seen many of them lately. It's swinging on to the pads, which has been a definite plan to Marsh, and he's flicked it through the gap at square leg along the ground, all the way to the boundary"
260,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run drives down the ground this time, in the air and it bounces to long-on"
261,"Shahzad to Bollinger, 1 run hmm, Bollinger has got away with one here, he's pulled and got a top edge that lobs safely in the infield. Not smart from Bollinger, with ten overs still to bat"
262,"Shahzad to Marsh, 4 leg byes ah, four more runs now as Marsh just gets a bit of pad on this and it beats the diving Prior, and trickles away to the boundary"
263,"Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run on the hips now and Marsh tickles it around the corner"
264,"Shahzad to Bollinger, 1 run full and straight, Bollinger drives to mid-on and takes off for a quick single, keeping the strike. And the throw from mid-on hits the stumps and allows an overthrow, so in fact Marsh will have the strike. But what's happened here? Tony Hill might have called over already, so the overthrow has been disallowed."
265,"Bresnan to Bollinger, FOUR runs and an angry Dougie takes his frustration out with a powerful crunch through cover, finding the gap and finding the boundary!"
266,"Bresnan to Bollinger, 1 run flicked away through square leg"
267,"Bresnan to Marsh, 2 runs good, hard running from Marsh, who clips a couple behind square leg"
268,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run oooh, a missed run-out chance here as Marsh cuts fine, and hesitates while taking the single, Trott's throw at the non-striker's end from point would have had Marsh out by miles, but it's missed"
269,"Bresnan to Bollinger, 1 run ooh, Bollinger tries the pull again and mistimes it again! It lobs up towards mid-on and lands safely"
270,"Bresnan to Marsh, 2 runs good drive back past the bowler from Marsh, who picks up two more"
271,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run driven to cover, can't find the gap"
272,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run smashed back at Tredwell, who does really well to field off his own bowling and prevent a run"
273,"Tredwell to Marsh, no run another cover drive finds the fielder"
274,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run pushed back down to mid on for a single"
275,"Tredwell to Bollinger, 1 run Bollinger goes the slog, but gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
276,"Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run Marsh drives a full toss to long-on"
277,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run goes for the slog but doesn't middle it"
278,"Bresnan to Marsh, FOUR runs another boundary, Marsh is really hitting the ball well and finding the gaps - this one is flicked over square leg and bounces away to the rope"
279,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run he's gone for the pull now but there's a man in the deep, who cuts that off"
280,"Bresnan to Bollinger, 1 leg bye bouncer! Bollinger goes for the hook, but it's crashed into his helmet and run away to third man for a leg bye. He doesn't look in too much strife, he's just bending down to do up his shoelace. He's fine!"
281,"Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run full and on leg side, clipped to square leg"
282,"Tremlett to Bollinger, OUT aah, Dougie's wonderful innings comes to an end! He's slapped Tremlett back over his head and in the air, but running around from mid-off is Shahzad, who actually takes a really good catch running back with the flight"
283,"Tremlett to Marsh, OUT ah, well, that's a rather unexpected end, as Marsh flicks high in the air to deep midwicket and the catch is taken"
284,Sahil will be back after the innings break to guide you through the chase.
285,"Australia have reached 230, which will make it an interesting chase after they looked like they'd struggle to get 170. Marsh was really magnificent, coming in at the unfamiliar No.6 position and rescuing his team from a massive hole. And what a slap-happy effort from Doug Bollinger."
286,"So England have a modest but competitive target to test their new opening combination against. Matt Prior's impact in the field was visible - plenty of energy - and audible - he was constantly barking away. If he was asking for any condition to make his ODI comeback, I suspect these might be it. Gettable chase against plenty of pace. Tait could b"
287,"Evening all, Sahil here. What an enjoyable innings that was. Showed all the merits to the 50-over format when it's played on a fair pitch. Twists and turns, time for recoveries, comebacks and more recoveries. Marsh was stunning, almost as stunning as the Australian selectors, who ignored him for the World Cup squad until Hussey's injury."
288,"Right, enough tattle. Strauss and Prior are out there, so are the Aussies. Brett Lee will start..."
289,"Lee to Strauss, no run and a good start it is too, no wild pace or anything, just the humble merits of line and length. Strauss defends but tentatively"
290,"Lee to Strauss, no run again Lee searches for the off-stump and finds Strauss defending very carefully. Placing the bat in line with the ball"
291,"Lee to Strauss, no run the fuller length here draws Strauss into something vaguely more attacking but it finds mid-on"
292,"Lee to Strauss, no run shorter from Lee, Strauss pulls straight to square leg"
293,"Lee to Strauss, 1 run Strauss is away, England are away. Gets another good back-of-a-length delivery from Lee and nudges into the leg side"
294,"Lee to Prior, no run Lee aims full for Prior's first delivery and it's jabbed out to cover. Good start from Lee"
295,"Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs oh! Starts very, very quickly indeed. Short ball which Strauss was waiting for but it was a bottom edge this far from the stumps. All of those hit for England, the luck is with them"
296,"Tait to Strauss, no run this again is full of pace but the line wide of off allows Strauss to leave"
297,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide big grunt as he delivers but this is too far down leg"
298,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide and again. Big appeal from Haddin, but when isn't there?"
299,"Tait to Strauss, no run better line this time, back of a length around off stump. Strauss is right behind it"
300,"Tait to Strauss, no run the pace effect! It just gets a batsman's beans going. Wide of off and Strauss slashes wildly at fresh air"
301,"Tait to Strauss, 1 wide banged in short. Very short. Too short for the umpire's liking. This is turning into a long over"
302,"Tait to Strauss, 1 run shortish this time but only gets up around hip level and Strauss wheels away a pull to fine leg"
303,"Tait to Prior, no run good finish to a lengthy over. Tait sliding the ball swiftly back into Prior who defends loosely"
304,"Lee to Strauss, no run Lee hitting those infamous 'right areas' and Strauss can only defend"
305,"Lee to Strauss, no run good areas from Lee, hugging off stump on a fullish length. Good stare too as he collects in his follow through"
306,"Lee to Strauss, no run a very straight delivery finds an equally straight bat. Lee is looking in good order so far"
307,"Lee to Strauss, 3 runs wow, this is an excellent shot. Lee again hammering away on a good length and line, Strauss stood tall and punched a back-foot drive wide of mid-off"
308,"Lee to Trott, no run excellent finish to an excellent Lee over. First ball to Trott has him rushing to defend"
309,"Tait to Strauss, 1 run ooh, Tait bangs in another short ball and really rushed Strauss on the pull. Got it high on the bat and it looped short of fine leg"
310,"Tait to Trott, FOUR runs another thunder-bolt short ball. Trott had only just thought about pulling and found the ball climbing towards his face. In the end he flapped a top edge that sailed over Haddin for four"
311,"Tait to Trott, no run Tait is grunting as loud as he's bowling quick. Very. Happily for Trott this is outside off stump so he leaves alone"
312,"Tait to Trott, 1 leg bye extreme pace just seems to create drama. Even leg bye, thudding off the thigh into the leg side, seems thoroughly hectic"
313,"Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs Strauss is sitting on the back foot waiting for something short. Tait lands a shortish ball, rather than a bouncer, and Strauss is in position to bang a pull shot to the midwicket fence"
314,"Tait to Strauss, no run review. Well well well. It was slipped down the leg side, Strauss missed an attempted fiddle to leg. Clipped the hip but Haddin thought it was more and persuaded Clarke to gamble. Tait wasn't interested and rightly so"
315,"Lee to Trott, no run Lee is yet to bowl a bad ball. This is perfectly straight and Trott defends back to him. Lee is full of puppy-dog excitement, despite his advancing years, and flings the ball back at Trott after he collects"
316,"Lee to Trott, no run touch shorter this time and Trott stands tall in defence"
317,"Lee to Trott, 2 runs neatly played, Trott walks across his stumps and flicks into the leg side"
318,"Lee to Trott, no run again Lee hammers it down on a length outside off stump. Trott hurries to defend"
319,"Lee to Trott, 1 run fuller ball, slower ball too. Cleverly aimed outside off to try and find the drag on. It was an inside edge, squirted to square leg, Strauss called one, Trott didn't go straight away and if the throw at the bowler's end hit, Trott would have gone"
320,"Lee to Strauss, 1 run Strauss gets back and, with a little help from the inside edge, works this to square leg"
321,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run banged in short, not a great start really, Strauss happily pulls to deep midwicket"
322,"Bollinger to Trott, no run another bouncer, but a sharper one this time. Trott gets into position to pull but it gets too high on him so he ducks out the shot"
323,"Bollinger to Trott, no run good follow-up ball. Pushed full and across the right hander. Trott aimed an airy drive but missed"
324,"Bollinger to Trott, 1 run back of a length and Trott whips behind square"
325,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run Strauss didn't get hold of his pull shot here, probably a bit too quick on the shot. Collects a single for the effort"
326,"Bollinger to Trott, no run Trott shuffles across his stumps to defend back to the bowler. Bollinger collects and shapes to fire a throw back at Trott, who is too consumed with marking his guard to notice"
327,"Lee to Strauss, no run lots of short balls to Strauss. Not sure why because he plays them well. This gets a touch high on him so he ducks out a pull shot"
328,"Lee to Strauss, no run again this is a touch short. Strauss wanted, desperately, to cut but it bounced a touch on him"
329,"Lee to Strauss, no run some width means Strauss gets to throw his arms at it, timed well enough but to extra cover"
330,"Lee to Strauss, 1 run short, short, short. Strauss wheels a firm pull to jog a single to deep square"
331,"Lee to Trott, FOUR runs for the first time Lee offers Trott a hint of room and is duly punished. Trott timed this cover drive dreamily and without anyone expecting it, it flew to the ropes"
332,"Lee to Trott, no run having taken the boundary he can shoulder arms. And as Ravi Shastri could have said, 'when he leaves them, they stay left'"
333,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run Bollinger persists with the short stuff and has Strauss in bother here as he misses an attempted pull shot. Crashed into the stomach"
334,"Bollinger to Strauss, no run the product of all the short balls is Strauss hanging back so Bollinger's change-up fuller delivery has Strauss pinned to the crease in defence"
335,"Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run this time Strauss is more steady in working to midwicket"
336,"Bollinger to Strauss, OUT Bollinger's good day just got much better! Strauss was again pinned on the crease and missed his attempted defence. Thudded into the pad and was given out. Strauss headed off but Trott has called a review! Height could be the issue.... but no, it is indeed hitting the top of leg stump"
337,"Watson to Trott, no run who starts tidily enough forcing Trott to defend"
338,"Watson to Trott, 1 run touch too short this time allows Trott to whip into the leg side"
339,"Watson to Bell, no run touch of swing here for Watson, just offering to wobble away. Bell careful in defence"
340,"Watson to Bell, no run touch of extra bounce for Watson has Bell standing tall to drop this into the off side and defend"
341,"Watson to Bell, no run good work from Watson, attacking the stumps. Bell eases into a defence"
342,"Watson to Bell, 1 run Bell glides a single to third man which means he's on strike for Douggie's hat-trick ball!"
343,"Bollinger to Bell, 2 runs oooh! Almost! Banged in a short ball and Bell didn't get much of a pull shot it looped wide of fine leg"
344,"Bollinger to Bell, 1 wide shoved short and wide across Bell, who thinks about cutting before deciding against it"
345,"Bollinger to Bell, no run this is left alone outside off stump"
346,"Bollinger to Bell, no run Bollinger has a packed offside field and is pushing the ball across Bell, who so far resists"
347,"Bollinger to Bell, no run back on a straighter line, Bell gets into line and defends comfortably"
348,"Bollinger to Bell, no run again Bell gets a sighter outside off stump. He watches carefully before lifting his arms and bat out of trouble"
349,"Bollinger to Bell, no run Doug sprints in, even quicker than he delivers, Bell leaves alone again outside off"
350,"Watson to Trott, 2 runs Trott does what he enjoys most, shuffling across his stumps to flick to leg"
351,"Watson to Trott, no run this is left all alone outside off stump"
352,"Watson to Trott, 1 run a hint of inside edge means this squirts towards fine leg for a single"
353,"Watson to Bell, no run ooh, Bell beaten outside off. Just decked away a fraction and Bell aimed one of those horrible bat-far-from body glides to third man that caused him so much trouble earlier in his career"
354,"Watson to Bell, no run more solid this time, rocking forward to defend"
355,"Watson to Bell, 1 run Bell has seen enough and sets off on a jaunt down the wicket, Watson sees him coming and goes short and wide, Bell slashes out to deep cover. All in one ball"
356,"Bollinger to Bell, 1 run Bollinger wants to do it all! Short and Bell works a single to square leg and Bollinger hares off after it. No real need to but he's having a ball"
357,"Bollinger to Trott, no run back of a length from the bowler, forcing Trott to defend carefully"
358,"Bollinger to Trott, no run fuller length this time, good variation. Trott gets forward to defend to cover"
359,"Bollinger to Trott, no run slower ball, he runs in even quicker to confuse the batsman, Trott isn't bothered and defends"
360,"Bollinger to Trott, no run scream from the bowler as he delivers, again Trott gets fully behind a defence"
361,"Bollinger to Trott, 1 run this is a touch shorter and slower, Trott watches it carefully onto the bat steers it to third man"
362,"Watson to Trott, 1 run classic Trott, shuffles across his stumps and works a single to leg"
363,"Watson to Bell, no run Bell fancies a dart at Watson. Who wouldn't? But Watson's pace, line and length is too good"
364,"Watson to Bell, FOUR runs plenty of oohs and aah from the Australian fielders as Bell drove this sweetly, but airily down the ground for four. Lee flew from mid-on to try an intercept, but couldn't reach it"
365,"Watson to Bell, no run this time Bell defends"
366,"Watson to Bell, 1 run inside edge again! How many have we seen today!? Plenty, that's how many. This slides off an that edge just past the stumps and runs away to fine leg"
367,"Watson to Trott, no run Trott is solidly forward to defend. Another eventful over"
368,"Tait to Bell, no run short ball to start with, plenty quick too. Bell though always seems to have time on his side and eases back to defend"
369,"Tait to Bell, FOUR runs top shot this time. Bell stands up on his toes and punches a drive through cover"
370,"Tait to Bell, (no ball) fired up fuller here, wide of off too. Bell leaves alone. It was, however, a no ball so free hit"
371,"Tait to Bell, no run as usual the free hit is an exercise in anti-climax. Bell gives himself room to slug a bouncer but misses"
372,"Tait to Bell, 1 run enough width here for Bell to steer down to third man"
373,"Tait to Trott, no run good length from Tait, full and offering to swing in. Trott blocks"
374,"Tait to Trott, 1 run again this is a touch wide, Trott guides to deep cover and ambles a single"
375,"Watson to Trott, no run worked off the pads to midwicket, straight to the fielder"
376,"Watson to Trott, no run good lines and lengths from Watson, Trott carefully drives to point"
377,"Watson to Trott, no run hint of a slower ball has Trott driving uneasily back to the bowler"
378,"Watson to Trott, no run Trott emulates the man bowling to him and pings a drive to mid-on"
379,"Watson to Trott, no run again Trott picks out mid-on. Good pressure building by Watson"
380,"Watson to Trott, 2 runs enough width here for Trott to unfurl a well-timed cover drive. The sweeper scoots round to field on the boundary"
381,"Tait to Bell, no run pushed away to the off side"
382,"Tait to Bell, no run left alone outside off and it thumps the gloves of Haddin"
383,"Tait to Bell, no run again it's left alone"
384,"Tait to Bell, no run no shot offered once again, as Tait probes outside off"
385,"Tait to Bell, 1 run cut hard as Bell gets some more width from Tait, and Watson on the boundary keeps it to one"
386,"Tait to Trott, no run left alone outside off"
387,"Hauritz to Bell, no run tossed up as Bell uses his feet, and then defends"
388,"Hauritz to Bell, 2 runs turns in from outside off, Bell cuts through point"
389,"Hauritz to Bell, 1 run wristy work from Trott, as he takes one from well outside off and flicks it through mid-on"
390,"Hauritz to Trott, no run beaten outside off as Hauritz gets some drift away from the batsman, who is drawn into a drive and can't connect"
391,"Hauritz to Trott, 2 runs reverse sweep this time from Trott, and White does the chasing down to third man"
392,"Hauritz to Trott, no run flicked away towards square leg"
393,"Tait to Bell, no run Tait probes just outside off and, like the celery sticks at a kid's birthday party, that has been left untouched"
394,"Tait to Bell, no run pushed back down the pitch towards Tait"
395,"Tait to Bell, 2 runs on the hips of Bell, who turns it around the corner and picks up a couple"
396,"Tait to Bell, no run good attacking line right on off stump, it's nudged away to the off side"
397,"Tait to Bell, no run nips it back in off the pitch, but another one is allowed to go through to Haddin"
398,"Tait to Bell, 1 run banged in a bit short of a length, and a single is worked through midwicket"
399,"Hauritz to Bell, no run Bell goes for the reverse sweep again, but it's been reverse successful. Didn't get anything on it."
400,"Hauritz to Bell, no run nudged back down the pitch"
401,"Hauritz to Bell, 1 run Hauritz turns it in to Bell, who flicks through square"
402,"Hauritz to Trott, no run more drift from Hauritz, and a tiny bit of spin, and in the end Trott decided not to play"

409,"Bollinger to Trott, no run pushed back down the pitch"
410,"Bollinger to Trott, 1 run this time it's Trott who guides one to third man for a comfortable single"
411,"Hauritz to Trott, no run good ball, a touch quicker and on line, it's defended"
412,"Hauritz to Trott, no run pushed away defensively again"
413,"Hauritz to Trott, 1 run tossed up way outside off, and Trott forces it through mid-on, refusing to be told where he should hit the ball"
414,"Hauritz to Bell, 1 run turned through square leg and the man in the deep keeps that to one, though Trott wanted two, was turned back and made an ungainly dive, getting his glove in the crease though the bat was raised. The third umpire is called, but Trott is safe."
415,"Hauritz to Trott, 1 run clipped away through mid-on again, easy as you like for Trott"
416,"Hauritz to Bell, no run Bell uses his feet and defends"

425,"Hauritz to Bell, 1 run turned away towards square leg"

428,"Hauritz to Bell, no run pushed down towards mid on"
429,"Smith to Trott, no run pushed back to the bowler, shouts of catch it but that bounced well short"
430,"Smith to Trott, OUT oh, Smith has struck second ball! And that was a pretty poor shot from Trott, who has pulled in the air straight to the catching man at short midwicket. He's picked the fielder out precisely. It may have been the topspinner, bounced a touch more than Trott expected."
431,"Smith to Morgan, no run tossed up on line, and Morgan defends"
432,"Smith to Morgan, 1 run cut away through point"
433,"Smith to Bell, 1 run Bell just nudges this one through the gap at cover"

438,"Hauritz to Bell, 1 run driven down towards long-on"
439,"Hauritz to Morgan, 1 wide and this one slides down the leg side, Haddin whips the bails off at the second attempt but there was no chance of Morgan being out of his ground"
440,"Hauritz to Morgan, no run punched away through point"
441,"Hauritz to Morgan, no run this one is tossed up and drops a bit on Morgan, who pushes to the off side"
442,"Smith to Bell, 1 run pushed away towards point"
