7,"Nasum to Philippe, 1 run round the wicket, touch short of a length outside off, worked towards mid-on"
8,"Nasum to Carey, FOUR runs round the wicket, it's a full toss outside off and Carey reverse sweeps to third man. It's a shot he likes"
9,"Nasum to Carey, no run comes over the wicket, conventional sweep this time from outside off and he finds square leg"
10,"Nasum to Carey, FOUR runs and now he reverses again, gets it past a diving point for another boundary...got himself across outside off stump"

12,"Nasum to Carey, 1 run gets forward and drives towards mid-off for a scampered single"

14,"Mahedi Hasan to Carey, no run full at off stump, comes forward and defends to cover"

25,"Nasum to Philippe, 1 run big appeal for lbw as Philippe misses a pull, taken on the back leg, no given on field and the review is call. This skidded through a touch, beat the under edge. Is it outside the line? Ah, well, he's actually hit it"

33,"Mustafizur to Philippe, no run good length at off stump, appears to grip in the surface, pop in the air to the on side"
34,"Mustafizur to Philippe, OUT takes leg stump! Magnificently done from Mustafizur. Philippe got in all sorts of a mess. A short-of-a-length delivery, he moved across the crease a touch and shaped to play to the leg side but was completely done by the slower ball. Brilliant bowling. Quick spin bowling."

63,"Nasum to Henriques, no run good comeback, length delivery on the stumps, straightens and takes the outside edge"

66,"Nasum to Henriques, no run full and straight, gets squared up again as he plays to the bowler"

79,"Shoriful Islam to Henriques, no run good length on leg and angling across. Henriques skips down the wicket, to cut after getting to the leg side of the ball. Misses, and he's lucky that has not hit the stumps"
80,"Shoriful Islam to Henriques, no run good length, on middle, and some bounce this time. Tries to cut, but the ball goes over the blade to the keeper"
81,"Shoriful Islam to Henriques, FOUR runs gloved and it runs to fine leg for four. Slower ball outside leg, tries to pull. Hits the hand and goes past short fine leg"

84,"Shoriful Islam to Henriques, FOUR runs that sounded goooood! Length ball on middle, comfortable height for Henriques. Feet firm, in position early, and swatted through the leg side for four"
85,"Shakib to Marsh, 1 run full on middle, and leg. Driven to midwicket, and the fielder in the deep runs in super fast to stop the second"

91,"Mahedi Hasan to Marsh, FOUR runs darts this one in. Full on leg, and flicked off his boots to deep backward square leg. Fielder at deep midwicket runs across a big distance, and just about cups it back into play. But the TV umpire wants to take a second look. Was his right hand hitting the skirting? Yes, unfortunately for Bangladesh"

97,"Shoriful Islam to Marsh, OUT big swing to the leg side but outside edge to the keeper. Length ball on off, and tries to hit it over midwicket, but with the ball angling away he had to get closer to the line to play it in that direction. Faint edge to the keeper and that's Marsh out on 45 for the second time in two days"
98,"Shoriful Islam to Turner, 1 run full, on middle, and pushed towards point. They are off for one, and Wade running to the non-striker's is running to the danger end. Fielder picks up and takes aim at one stump for a run out but it's not a direct hit. Mahedi Hasan the man picking up the ball"
99,"Shoriful Islam to Wade, 1 run back of a length, just outside off. Pull attempted, but dragged towards the left of square leg instead"

103,"Mustafizur to Turner, no run full, outside off stump as Turner backs away to make some room expecting the ball to be in the stumps. It's not, and it's inside the tramline as well. Fair ball!"
104,"Mustafizur to Turner, 1 run cutter, full on leg. Guided to deep point for a single"
105,"Mustafizur to Wade, OUT leg stump cartwheeling! Full on off, and he walks across to the off side to try and paddle it to fine leg. Misses the shot, and the ball crashes into leg"
106,"Mustafizur to Agar, OUT Ashton leaves Ashton! Good length, outside off. Agar tentatively looks to cut it square, but there's a bit of extra bounce despite the slower ball, and it hits the glove. Pops up in the air towards the keeper and that's something his five-year old self could've also taken"
107,"Mustafizur to Starc, 1 wide slower ball, full outside leg, and rolls towards the keeper"
108,"Mustafizur to Starc, no run full ball, slower ball just outside off. Comes to drive with hard hands, and it pops up. Falls just in front of short midwicket diving forward"
109,"Mustafizur to Starc, 1 run good length, just outside off. Cut behind point and they scamper across for one"
110,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, 1 run good length, outside off and cut to deep point for one"
111,"Shoriful Islam to Turner, OUT back of a length outside off. Angling away and he tries to cut it over the off side. Spooned up in the air, and cover backtracks to take a simple one"

113,"Shoriful Islam to Starc, no run full pitch, outside off stump. He walks across to the off side and mistimes a shot down the ground"

116,"Mustafizur to Tye, 2 runs full, on middle, change of pace. Bunted over the bowler to long off for a couple"
117,"Mustafizur to Tye, 1 leg bye full, pitched outside leg and hits the pad before rolling over to point. LBW appeal turned down but no way that was out"
118,"Mustafizur to Starc, FOUR runs full on middle, and flicked through the leg side. Goes finer than he attempted, but it's gone for four! First four in 25 balls"
119,"Mustafizur to Starc, no run back of a length slower ball outside off. Wants to cut, through the shot too early. Well disguised, 100% skill"
120,"Mustafizur to Starc, 2 runs slower ball, full and wide. Toe-ends the cut towards third man for one"
121,"Mustafizur to Starc, 2 runs full outside off. Clears the front leg and drags a shot to deep midwicket. Takes two and Australia finish on 121 for 7"
122,"What Australia now need are wickets at the top, and then get Shakib-Mahmudullah early as well, to have any chance of a win. Batting isn't easy over here but given Bangladesh know what rate they have to score at, they will feel comfortable earning the W."
123,"7.32pm Bangladesh big favourites to go up 2-0 in this series. If it was spinners that caused damage yesterday, today it was the fast bowlers who used their cutters really well. Marsh impressed once again, on a surface that is tough, yes, but one that can't be used as an excuse to brush away the way the middle and lower-middle order fell apart. A marginally better but overall"
124,Hello again. Gnasher with you for the start of the chase. Can Australia make a game of it? Mitchell Starc to open up with two slips...
125,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, no run back of a length outside off, swings away from the left hander, through to the keeper"
126,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, no run at off stump, short of a length, defended towards point"
127,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, no run snorting delivery! A short ball which clatters into the helmet as Naim can't sway out of the live. Starc checks he is okay. Naim will be checked over the physio here. Seemed to take the peak of the helmet"
128,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, no run length ball, pushed firmly towards point"
129,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, 2 runs playing away from his body, gets a thickish outside edge that runs quickly to third man"
130,"Starc to Mohammad Naim, 1 run good length outside off, opens the face down to third man again...a challenging opening over from Starc"
131,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, no run that's a slog! Good length outside off, Naim tries to swing it through midwicket but loses shape on the stroke and misses"
132,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, 2 runs through the gap! Playing away from his body outside off, flies off the face and somehow threads through backward point"
133,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, no run a shorter delivery, Naim pulls from outside off and finds mid-on"
134,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, 2 runs moves across outside off then tucks this off the pads, although effectively around off stump, through square leg"
135,"Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, no run round the wicket, good length outside off, Naim swings across the line and the ball scoots under the bottom edge...doesn't carry to Wade"

137,"Starc to Soumya, no run full outside off, driven to cover"
138,"Starc to Shakib, FOUR runs full and straight, a lovely piece of timing through the leg side as this is flicked wide of mid-on...a much more composed way of dealing with a very similar delivery that took the wicket"
139,"Starc to Shakib, FOUR runs and again, full at off stump, whipped off the pads through square with terrific timing. Shakib is off and running. Showing his quality as a batter"
140,"Starc to Shakib, FOUR runs edged, wide of the keeper! Terrific comeback from Starc. In the channel outside off, draws the nick as Shakib gets squared up. Wade can't reach it with a dive and there's no slip. It's all happening"
141,"Starc to Shakib, no run and he finishes with a short ball over middle and leg which Shakib can't connect with as he aims to swat it away"
142,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, no run hammers a good length at off stump, Mahedi's hurried into his defensive shot"
143,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, no run gets across the crease and plays forward into a fullish delivery outside off"
144,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, 1 wide a bouncer over off stump and it's too short"
145,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, no run pushes this fuller at the stumps, he's a little caught on the crease and plays to the on side"
146,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, no run full and brings the drive, takes an inside edge into his boot"
147,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, no run short of a length, goes for the pull and the ball ends up at Wade...there's appeals for a few things, but too high for lbw (it clipped the pad) and no bat involved"
148,"Agar to Shakib, no run over the wicket, almost through him first ball...beats the inside edge as Shakib aims to the leg side. Wade didn't glove it. Don't think he nicked it"

150,"Agar to Mahedi Hasan, 2 runs carved high in the air, but short of long-off! Mahedi trying to go over the off side, stepped away outside leg, the ball spun and he struggled to reach it. Came off the toe end"

156,"Hazlewood to Shakib, 1 run full and straight, worked into square leg"

159,"Hazlewood to Mahedi Hasan, 2 runs short of a length, pulled over midwicket this time, not timed but lands safely"
160,"Agar to Shakib, no run huge appeal and given! That's a massive moment. Full and straight, Shakib playing right across it. He's called the review but that looks out. Well, well...it isn't very out at all! Turning to miss leg stump. The initial line was a bit straighter than I first thought"
161,"Agar to Shakib, 1 run a powerful bottom-handed whip from outside off down the ground"
162,"Agar to Mahedi Hasan, 2 runs would you believe it! Lands short of long-off again. Gets too far underneath it as he goes down the ground"

171,"Zampa to Shakib, 1 run worked into space at midwicket"

175,"Tye to Mahmudullah, no run well bowled, full outside off, just shapes away and beats a prodding stroke"

183,"Marsh to Afif, no run trapped lbw? Afif will be disappointed. Full, around leg stump. Looks to clip it leg side but misses. Finger raised, and Afif reviews. Afif will survive only if it pitched outside leg. And hey, it's pitched outside leg! Big reprieve for Afif."

185,"Marsh to Afif, FOUR runs brave! Walks down the ground and looks to hammer this back of a length ball through the leg side. Edged over the vacant slip region for four"

200,"Tye to Afif, SIX runs the extra ball goes the distance, but only just! Full on his toes, and flicked to deep midwicket. Fielder in the deep, looks like Zampa, is running to the boundary line to take a catch, and although its in his hands, he's gone over the rope. How crucial will those six runs be in a close match?"

213,"Starc to Nurul, FOUR runs around the stumps, full on middle, and flicked beautifully! Starts the over with a bang, using the pace to nudge it to deep backward square for four!"
214,"Starc to Nurul, 1 run over the stumps. Fullish, just outside off. Tries to cut, too close to his body, and inside-edged past the stumps towards the keeper. They scamper across for one, and Wade tries to throw the stumps down at the bowler's end, but misses the direct hit. Risky play"
215,"Starc to Afif, FOUR runs in the slot, full and wide, and a controlled drive over cover! This was sublime. Right up there with Ganguly, Sangakkara and the other greats. #HoldThePose"
216,"Starc to Afif, 1 wide yorker length, on leg, and he shuffles across to clip it behind square on the leg side. Past the boot, past leg stump, and the umpire calls it a wide. Perhaps slightly harsh since it would've hit the batter's heel if he stood in his original stance"
217,"Starc to Afif, 1 run full on off, and driven to long on for a single"
218,"Starc to Nurul, 1 run fullish, on middle, and worked to midwicket for an easy single"

220,"Starc to Afif, no run full on leg stump. Misses the flick, hits the pad. Not out though since it's angling down leg"
221,"Zampa to Nurul, no run full on middle. Big stride forward to defend"
222,"Zampa to Nurul, FOUR runs crunched! Short on off and turning away. Stands tall, doesn't commit early, and slaps a shot over the fielder at cover! Pierces the gap between extra cover and long off"
223,"Zampa to Nurul, no run full on off, and googly turns in. Bat-pad to the leg side"
224,"Zampa to Nurul, 1 run driven through the off side to wide long off for one"
225,"Zampa to Afif, no run full outside off, and the googly turns across. Misses the drive"

227,"Tye to Nurul, 1 run good length, outside off. Nudged to third man for one"
228,"Tye to Afif, 1 wide back of a length, outside leg stump. Walks across to pull towards fine leg but misses. Gets the wide though"
229,"Tye to Afif, no run good length, on leg stump. Defended towards the off side"
230,"Tye to Afif, FOUR runs lofted! And we're into single digits now. Knuckle ball, on middle, and hammered over mid on for four"
231,"Tye to Afif, FOUR runs over the vacant slip cordon! Back of a length on leg and angling across. Not in control but he ramps it from close to his chest for four. Quite a thick edge"
232,"Tye to Afif, no run good length angling across. Misses the cut"
233,"Tye to Afif, no run full, on off. Slower one. Pushed to point with the angled bat"

236,"Hazlewood to Afif, no run fullish, just outside off stump. Tapped towards backward point for one"
237,"Hazlewood to Afif, FOUR runs back of a length, outside off stump. Sticks the bat out, ramps it over the keeper and Bangladesh have won by 5 wickets!"
238,"9.30pm A fist pump between the two youngsters who have dragged Bangladesh out of a very deep hole. Even Justin Langer is applauding them. A lone fan is flying the flag on a nearly building's roof. Imagine if we had a full crowd today! The partnership is unbeaten on 56.... to win from 67/5 with Australia's bowlers roaring, it needed a special effort."
239,"The high-adrenaline chase wil make Afif and Nurul heroes this evening, but don't forget the bowling effort. To restrict Australia to 121 is massive, and credit for that goes to Mustafizur and Shoriful firstly, along with the ever consistent spinners."
240,Presentation coming up.
241,"That's all from myself Sreshth, Andrew McGlashan and Ranjith P. Remember there's plenty of cricket happening. England v India and the Hundred. Hop over there to enjoy more cricket. See you!"
