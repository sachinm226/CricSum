0,"Toss, 7.00 pm MS Dhoni tosses the coin. Steven Smith calls tails and wins. Australia will bat first. He says he thinks the pitch might slow up later in the day, but he isn't sure. It is the same pitch that was used for the women's game between India and West Indies earlier today."
1,"Nehra to Khawaja, FOUR runs too short, and there's no pace on this pitch, it sits up for the left-hander and Khawaja dismisses it to the square leg boundary with a pull along the ground"
2,"Nehra to Khawaja, no run Khawaja begins to try and cut it but then checks his shot, let's it pass through to the keeper, Nehra's length was better and his line outside off"
3,"Nehra to Khawaja, no run he's properly beaten this time by a superb ball! Nehra slants it into the left-hander from over the wicket, landing on a great length around off sump, the ball seams away sharply and Khawaja is beaten as he poked from his crease"
4,"Nehra to Khawaja, no run cut off the back foot but he can't beat point"
5,"Nehra to Khawaja, no run short of a length delivery outside off and that ball keeps rather low, Khawaja tries to cut from his crease but gets beaten on the bottom edge"
6,"Nehra to Khawaja, no run terrific comeback from Nehra after that first-ball four, the last ball pitches on a good length and seams away, squaring up the left-hander and beating the bat as he tries to defend"
7,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run risky run to get off the mark! Finch pushes towards mid-on and takes on Pandya rushing in, he misses at the non-striker's end. He might have just made it even with a direct hit"
8,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs a length ball on a pretty straight line, Khawaja gets on the front foot and hoists it over the infield at midwicket for his second boundary"
9,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs a length ball again and that disappears too! Khawaja presses forward and lofts the ball wide of the fielder at mid-on"
10,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs three in a row! Bumrah goes around the wicket to change his line but his length is the same - poor. Khawaja stays on his crease and pulls, hitting the ball along the ground behind square leg. Cracking start."
11,"Bumrah to Khawaja, no run played from the crease to cover point"
12,"Bumrah to Khawaja, FOUR runs amazing over for the Aussies! Khawaja stays back to a short of a length ball and cuts late and deftly past the fielder at short third man. 17 runs off the over"
13,"Nehra to Finch, no run Finch walks down the pitch and slightly towards the off side to whip the ball off his hips but he misses, that passed over leg stump"
14,"Nehra to Finch, FOUR runs Nehra loses his line, spraying it wide outside off from over the wicket, Finch reaches for it and unleashes a mighty cut, the ball was so far outside off that it connected with the toe of the bat but still raced through point"
15,"Nehra to Finch, 1 run closer to off stump this time and Finch bottom edges the cut into the ground through to Dhoni, who doesn't collect cleanly"
16,"Nehra to Khawaja, FOUR runs Khawaja is on fire! He steps out of his crease and Nehra follows him with a full ball, trying to cramp him for room, Khawaja flicks and gets an inside edge between the pads that goes past short fine leg for his sixth boundary!"

20,"Ashwin to Finch, no run backs away far outside leg to hit through the off side but mis-times to the bowler"
21,"Ashwin to Finch, SIX runs massive! Finch moves outside leg and comes forward to slam a full ball far over the long-on boundary, that was hit beautifully"
22,"Ashwin to Finch, SIX runs this one isn't as beautiful but it's good enough to beat the leaping fielder on the edge of the long-on boundary! Finch gave it everything again, but did not connect as well as the previous one"
23,"Ashwin to Finch, 5 wide that is so wide outside leg stump, Dhoni has no chance, and short fine leg can't stop it either! Five extras to the total"
24,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 wide what is with this line? Extremely wide down leg again, this time Dhoni was wise enough to move early"
25,"Ashwin to Finch, 2 runs flicked through square leg and they run hard to come back for the second"
26,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run clipped off the pads behind square for a single. Ashwin has been dismantled in that over"
27,"Nehra to Finch, 1 run nothing is going India's way! Finch jumped back to flick but got a leading edge that lobbed over midwicket, Raina was walking in but then had to stop and rush back ... he could not get to it in time"
28,"Nehra to Khawaja, OUT caught behind and the crowd roars for the first time in this game! Khawaja drove hard at a good length ball that shaped away from him from around off stump and got a thick edge through to Dhoni. India have their first wicket. That ball flew rapidly to the keeper."

32,"Nehra to Finch, no run a slightly slower one from Nehra to finish, Finch tries to dab it on the leg side but is hit on the thigh, he misjudged the pace. That's the first over without a boundary"
33,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 leg bye an appeal for lbw after Warner is hit on the pad by a skiddy ball from around the wicket, that was missing leg, they run a leg bye after the ball goes towards Dhoni's left"
34,"Bumrah to Finch, no run over the wicket to the right-hander, a length ball outside off, Finch drives firmly from his crease but can't beat cover"
35,"Bumrah to Finch, no run he's nailed the drive again but can't beat mid-off this time, Bumrah has got away with two ordinary balls, still bowling length on this pitch"

49,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run goes back and places the ball in front of square leg for one more"
50,"Ashwin to Warner, OUT stumped! Warner skipped down the track but could not get to the pitch of the delivery, perhaps he came forward too early and Ashwin shortened his length and slowed the pace down too.

51,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run goes deep into his crease to tuck the ball off his pads through square leg"

He fired it in quick from around the wicket and got the ball to bounce a bit away from the right-hander, Smith stayed back and wafted at the ball. Dhoni went up rightaway, but Smith looked unhappy. I'll wait for replays to"

129,9.00 pm Have Australia got enough? They looked set for 200 when Khawaja and Finch were going at top speed in the Powerplay but timing became a struggle once the ball got older and the field spread. If there's no dew I think it will be an interesting chase. So much depends on Virat Kohli.
130,Josh Hazlewood with the new ball.
131,"The chase is about to begin. The Australians gather on the edge of the boundary, they have 160 to defend. The stadium is packed and filled with optimism, awaiting the players to take the field.

179,"Coulter-Nile to Yuvraj, 1 run tucked off the hips to fine leg and Yuvraj hobbles in pain as he begins to run. What's happened there? It's his left leg and he was hopping through to complete the run. The physio comes on to take a look at what's wrong. Yuvraj had jumped back to glance the ball off his hips and as his left foot landed it twisted as"

181,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, 1 run there's that cover drive from Kohli, gets forward and punches the ball through the line, timing it superbly, they could have run two but Yuvraj's leg isn't in good shape"
