0,"9pm A career-best 80 from Wade and some Maxwell magic has lifted Australia to 186. India were sloppy in the field, dropping multiple catches, but Natarajan and Thakur were impressive with their variations in the end overs, reining Australia in. Have Australia got enough to avoid a 3-0 sweep? Alex will be back in a bit to launch the chase."
