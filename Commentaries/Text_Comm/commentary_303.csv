222,"Faulkner to Behardien, 1 run slower ball, fairly full outside off, and it completely flummoxed Peterson, who shaped to drive, then decided to try and dab it, and ended up pulling his bat away to leave the ball"
223,"Faulkner to Peterson, no run another back-of-the-hand slower ball and Peterson is beaten again, this time playing down the wrong line as it straightened past off stump"
224,"Faulkner to Peterson, no run"
225,"Faulkner to Peterson, 1 run a bit fuller and he gets a single with the checked drive to mid-off"

228,"Starc to Behardien, 1 run in the blockhole on a fourth-stump line, jabbed away towards cover point"
229,"Starc to Peterson, no run makes room and Starc follows him with the back-of-a-length ball. Looked to pull, could get no room to swing his arms and ended up dragging it feebly to short midwicket"
230,"Starc to Peterson, 1 run full on off stump, and he clears his front leg and slogs it along the ground to long-on"
231,"Starc to Behardien, 1 run full outside off, and he throws his bat at it and slices it uppishly down to third man. Excellent over to end an excellent spell from Starc"
232,"Faulkner to Behardien, 1 run back of a length slower ball on middle and leg. Clears his front leg and clubs it down to long-on"
233,"Faulkner to Peterson, no run slower ball outside off and he looks for the reverse-slap. Doesn't connect, misses by a long way"

235,"Faulkner to Peterson, OUT gone! That was the slower ball, full and straight, and Peterson looked to slog it across the line, over the leg side. He was through his shot too quickly and the ball sneaked through and crashed into middle stump"
236,"Faulkner to Parnell, 1 run full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
237,"Faulkner to Behardien, OUT and another. This one's a run-out, Warner sends in a pinpoint direct hit from mid-off. Behardien drove this straight to the fielder. It was another slower ball, on leg stump, and he made room to play the drive but couldn't get it past Warner. Took his arm on and lost, by quite a distance. Gave up and simply hoped Warner would"
238,"Cummins to Steyn, no run slower ball, back of a length. Steyn looks to back away and smash it down the ground, toe-ends it back to the bowler"

243,"Cummins to Parnell, 2 runs slower ball to finish. It's a touch short on off stump and he pulls it away into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket to pick up two"
244,"5.55pm Splendid recovery from Australia's bowlers after that AB-Miller partnership. The batting powerplay undid South Africa, and the Australian seamers kept up their good work through the death overs, using the slower ball very intelligently. South Africa only scored 82 in their last 15 overs, and 51 in their last 10."
245,"6.24pm Meanwhile, in Dubai, New Zealand have set Pakistan a target of 261 to win the second Test."
246,"6.35pm Here we go again. Australia need 268 to seal the series win. Aaron Finch and David Warner stride out with that aim in their heads, and Dale Steyn is hell bent on preventing them from getting off to a good start."
247,"Steyn to Finch, no run outswinger on a nice length outside off. Finch leaves it alone"
248,"Steyn to Finch, 1 run back of a length outside off, steered to third man off the back foot"

262,"Steyn to Finch, 2 runs lovely shot, excellent fielding, marred a bit by the throw. It was a length ball on off stump and he showed it the full face to punch it to the right of mid-off. Parnell dived to his right to stop it and then threw to the bowler's end unneccessarily to give away an overthrow"
263,"Steyn to Finch, no run shout for caught behind, and it isn't given. South Africa are wondering whether to review, and Steyn asks the batsman if he hit it. As if he's going to say yes. It straightened outsode off, from back of a length, and he poked at it with no footwork. Looked like it missed his edge, good thing they didn't review"

266,"Abbott to Watson, 1 run back of a length outside off, slapped away to the right of third man"

268,"Abbott to Finch, no run this one's closer to off stump but the result is the same. Finch's feet are stuck and his hands are poking at everything."
269,"Abbott to Finch, no run this one's angled in a bit more and Finch can get behind it and punch solidly to short cover"
270,"Steyn to Watson, no run length ball, angling in and straightening from a fourth-stump line. Watson leaves it alone"

278,"Abbott to Watson, no run there's that front pad of Watson's, thrust dangerously in front of his stumps. Abbott angled it in and bowled it fairly full, and his bat came down just in time and he squeezed it off the inside edge onto his pad towards short midwicket"

283,"McLaren to Finch, no run back of a length, angling in towards off and middle. Finch punches off the back foot to mid-off"
284,"McLaren to Finch, 2 runs fuller now, and McLaren gives him a bit of width outside off. He throws his bat at it and chips it over cover. Doesn't quite middle it and it stops well short of the rope"
285,"McLaren to Finch, FOUR runs full again, even more width, and this time it's right off the sweet spot, a lovely, low, skimming hit over cover"
286,"McLaren to Finch, no run back of a length now, angling in. Doesn't have enough room for the cut and he's beaten by the extra bounce"

288,"Abbott to Watson, no run length ball outside off, big stride out and defends into the covers"
289,"Abbott to Watson, 1 run length ball outside off, looked like he bowled it with an offcutter action. Watson came forward and let it come on before chopping it down to third man"
290,"Abbott to Finch, no run ooooh, that looked close. This one came in from outside off and caught Finch on the back pad, on the shuffle. Not given, and de Villiers doesn't review. Hit him on the flap of the pad, and Hawkeye says it's going over the stumps"
291,"Abbott to Finch, no run again he's caught on the crease, on the shuffle, but he manages to squeeze it away into the off side. Lovely length from Abbott"

They set off for a single, and Finch could have been run out at the batsman's end had Parnell connected with that kick he aimed at the ball in his follow-through"

434,"Abbott to Smith, no run Smith played the pull too early and ended up toe-ending the ball back to the bowler"
435,"Abbott to Smith, FOUR runs what sort of a shot is that? Smith backs away outside leg to a short ball and tennis-smashes it over the head of the fielder mid-off. Ugly, ungainly, unorthodox, but it got the job done."

443,"Parnell to Wade, 1 run length ball on off stump. Wade clips it towards mid-on and immediately calls Smith through for a risky-looking single. Oh yes. McLaren's throw went over the stumps at the bowler's end. Had he hit, it was bye, bye, Wade."

451,"Behardien to Wade, no run back of a length, angled across, chopped down to short third man"

460,"Abbott to Wade, no run back of a length, angled across, bunted towards short cover"
461,"Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs fullish on off stump and Smith clears his front leg and slogs it away over midwicket. Doesn't quite get hold of it but he picks out a vacant area and picks up four for his efforts"

465,"Steyn to Wade, no run length ball angling towards off stump, and he clears his front leg and dabs it to backward point"
466,"Steyn to Wade, no run super work from de Kock. It was slanting away and he slashed hard at it. The thick inside edge could have easily run away for four but the keeper threw himself to his left to stop the ball one-gloved"
467,"Parnell to Smith, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, shuffles across and tucks it away towards fine leg"
468,"Parnell to Wade, 1 run down the track and he shortens his length a bit. Slogs it away down to mid-on"

485,"McLaren to Smith, 1 run length ball, angling in towards middle and off, clipped away to long leg"
486,"McLaren to Wade, FOUR runs short ball and Wade has pulled that away and made very good contact. Deep square leg completely misjudged it. It was du Plessis. He came a few steps forward, then realised Wade has hit it much harder than he thought, and tries to dive backwards and take the catch but can't get anywhere near it"
487,"McLaren to Wade, no run down the track, looked to mow the shortish ball over the leg side, was beaten. Shout from the keeper for caught behind, and Snicko does show a tiny little spike, but can't say if that was bat on ball"
488,"McLaren to Wade, 1 run back of a length on off stump, dabbed away towards backward point"
489,"McLaren to Smith, 1 wide full-toss wide outside off, and that nearly ran away for four wides. De Kock must have stretched a couple of muscles to breaking point in diving across to his right to stop that"

499,"Parnell to Smith, 1 run short ball and he swivels around to pull that to the man at deep midwicket"
500,"Parnell to Wade, SIX runs shortish outside off, and that is a sensational shot from Wade. Opens up, makes a bit of room, and clubs it down the ground, over the gap between the bowler and mid-off, and the ball carries all the way over the rope"

505,"McLaren to Wade, 4 byes oh, my. It was the slower one, angled in, and he slogged and missed. Rolled down to the keeper, and for once de Kock couldn't stop it, got up a little too quickly, and it ran away under his gloves."

507,"McLaren to Smith, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, tucked away towards square leg"
508,"McLaren to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle and leg, tucked away towards square leg"

510,"McLaren to Smith, 1 run back of a length on off stump, shuffles across and works it towards square leg"
511,"Parnell to Smith, 1 run There's that Smith tennis smash. It was the bouncer and he hit it from above shoulder height, and just about cleared the bowler"
512,"Parnell to Smith, (no ball) 1 run full-toss on off stump and he's clipped it down to deep square leg. No-ball as well, and the umpire signals for the free hit"

525,"Steyn to Faulkner, 1 bye shortish slower ball outside off and he plays and misses. de Kock misjudges the bounce behind the stumps and they sneak a quick bye. Steyn, needless to say, is livid"
526,"Steyn to Smith, 1 run and that's his hundred. Ungainly way to get it, a mistimed pull that rolls away towards square leg, but what an innings this has been. Australia were sinking without a trace when he began"

They take him on and Smith wins the race, getting to the crease before Abbott can reach in front of the stumps and collect the throw"

531,"Abbott to Faulkner, FOUR runs full-toss on leg stump and Faulkner clears his front leg and mows it over wide mid-on. Really poor ball, that. That was a baseball hit"

533,"Abbott to Faulkner, 2 runs back of a length on middle and leg, swatted away down to long leg"
534,"Abbott to Faulkner, FOUR runs boom! That was short, and that is a familiar sight by now. Left leg moves away to make room. Arms swing through free and unfettered, ball disappears to the leg-side boundary."

536,"Peterson to Faulkner, no run what happened there? Went for the big hit over the leg side, and it hit his thigh and was rolling towards the stumps, but he reached behind him and tapped the ball away"

Went in the air to the right of mid-on, and Miller threw himself horizontally and came away with the ball in his right hand and a look of disbelief on his face. They aren't sure h"
541,"10.35pm Short and sweet presentation ceremony there. No interviews with the captains and so forth. Just how it should be, methinks, but I'd say that, having been typing all this while and being grateful to avoid any more transcribing and whatnot. So that brings an end to our coverage as well.
