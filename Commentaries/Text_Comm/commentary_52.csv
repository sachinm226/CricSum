267,"Chahal to Jhye Richardson, no run full and spinning away outside off, pushed out to point"
268,"Chahal to Jhye Richardson, OUT pays the price for playing against the turn. Nicely looped in towards leg stump, temping him to close the face against the turn. Lands just short enough to muster up some turn and results in the batsman chipping it tamely to short midwicket as he closes the face"

292,"Chahal to Zampa, no run shortish, a bit of width, cut to point"
293,"Chahal to Zampa, OUT and another one goes. Sixth wicket for Chahal, equals Agarkar's record for most wickets at the MCG by a visiting bowler. This one's nicely looped up and inviting him to come forward. Zampa charges down and swipes big without getting entirely underneath it and holes out to long-on"

300,"Australia have managed just 17 boundaries in the 47-odd overs they have bowled. It all paints an ominous sign, really. India's top-order is among the most domineering and overpowering in world cricket. Barring the entire top-order collapsing, this will be uphill for Australia. We'll be back with the chase in due course."
301,"India handed out a debut to Vijay Shankar, and he seemed to do fine with his gentle medium pacers, producing nice and accurate lines and keeping it tight. Buvneshwar Kumar set them up for this failure by nipping out the openers in quick time. Finch tried all he could - including standing several yards outside the crease - to counter his swing, but once again fell victim to the inswinger. All he had to show for all that effort were 14 runs."
302,"5.20pm Another underwhelming day for Australia. It's become so common on this tour. Doesn't look like the rain can save them anymore as the weather seems to be holding up fine. They need to bowl seriously well. Not impossible. This is a slowish surface, a bit two-paced and a bit of variable bounce as well. But they will have to pull more than their share of weight with the ball."
303,5.47pm Raining again at the MCG. Covers are on. Gnasher says warm-ups are still going on and the big sheet is now being removed. The pitch covers are being pulled off now. Play will resume at 5.55pm. No overs lost. The players are all ready to go.

312,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run good length off stump, 133kph, he defends on the front foot to mid on"
313,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run big appeal for LBW given not out. Australia review. They burnt one early in Sydney. It's a fair delivery. Good length nipping back, hitting the back leg. No bat involved. Ball tracking had it hitting in line, and hitting but it's umpire's call! Hitting the top of the stumps but not more than 50 per cent according to Hawkeye. It stays Not out.
