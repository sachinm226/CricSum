0,"Archer to Warner, no run nice zippy opening delivery, good length outside off, Warner allows it to go through"
1,"Archer to Warner, no run what a brute! This climbs from back of a length, Warner has to jump out of the line as it carries at head height to Buttler"
2,"Archer to Warner, OUT given caught behind, and Warner has reviewed straight away! He made the call in the instant he was given. Another cracking delivery, short of a length, nips back at Warner and beats the inside edge, but the replay shows that glanced the glove!"
3,"Archer to Carey, no run Archer is flying, keeps it short of a length and this rises through to Buttler as Carey stays inside the line"
4,"Archer to Carey, no run beaten again! 91mph, fuller outside off, Carey is caught a little flat-footed as he reaches out to drive"
5,"Archer to Carey, 1 run missed run out chance! Short of a length, dropped square into the off side, there's all sorts of confusion between the batsmen. Moeen comes in from gully, can't quite underarm it into the stumps"
6,"Wood to Carey, no run over the wicket, 89mph/144kph, back of a length at middle, played back to the bowler"
7,"Wood to Carey, no run fuller at middle and leg, 92mph/148kph, aims to whip it through the leg side but it deflects off the pads towards point"
8,"Wood to Carey, 1 run top edged hook! A short ball on leg stump, gets underneath it but falls short of long leg...not much out of the middle so far"
9,"Wood to Finch, 1 run good length at the stumps, flicked backward of square and Rashid tumbles down to make the save at short fine leg. Almost done by a bobble off the outfield"
10,"Wood to Carey, OUT edged, caught behind! What a start from England. Carey tries to give himself a touch of room to the leg side, shapes a drive at a good-length delivery but can only get a thin nick to Buttler"
11,"Wood to Smith, no run full outside off, 89mph/144kph, plinks a drive into the covers"
12,"Archer to Finch, no run lovely delivery as Finch is caught on the crease against a good-length ball outside off and it zips past the outside edge. That was 95.8mph / 154.2kph!"
13,"Archer to Finch, SIX runs all the way! Takes on the short ball, gets well underneath this pick-up pull off his hip. For a second it looked like it might find the man at deep square but it was well back"
14,"Archer to Finch, no run what a comeback! That's a 91mph/146kph leg-cutter which scorchers past the outside edge"

21,"Wood to Finch, no run that's a much more confident shot, but picks out the cover fielder as he drives off the back foot"

23,"Wood to Finch, 2 runs nicely timed, short of a length outside off, punched through the covers for a brace"
24,"Tom Curran to Smith, FOUR runs misfield gives Smith a boundary, short of a length, he shovels a pull through square leg and the deep fielder can't cut it off"
25,"Tom Curran to Smith, no run gets squared up this time, back of a length, played into midwicket"
26,"Tom Curran to Smith, no run that's a cracker! Jags away from back of a length, beats the outside edge and carries nicely. Something in this pitch"
27,"Tom Curran to Smith, SIX runs clears deep square leg! Terrific pull shot by Smith, the delivery wasn't that short, just back of a length and swung away"
28,"Tom Curran to Smith, no run played back down the pitch, was aiming into midwicket"
29,"Tom Curran to Smith, OUT run out with a direct hit! Brilliant work from Eoin Morgan. Pushed towards mid-on, the captain quickly in and an underarm into the stumps. Smith well short"

33,"Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs nice piece of timing, but mid-on could have done better...leans forward and times the on-drive, Curran dives over it"
34,"Wood to Stoinis, no run inswinging yorker at off stump, 94mph/151kph, jabbed into the covers"
35,"Wood to Stoinis, 1 run doesn't really time this pull, sends it into square leg"

37,"Rashid to Finch, no run quicker, flatter at leg stump, pushed to the off side...out of the front from Rashid"
38,"Rashid to Finch, no run big appeal for lbw from Buttler as Stoinis presses forward, certainly came off the bat in the end. And England have reviewed! Ha, he couldn't have middled that any better. Not one of the better reviews. Even Buttler has a laugh"
39,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run full at off stump, driven down the ground"
40,"Rashid to Stoinis, no run a little shorter, played off the back foot to the bowler"
41,"Rashid to Stoinis, no run almost pops this up to cover, the ball grips and sticks in the surface, pushes with hard hands to the off side"
42,"Jordan to Finch, 1 run good start, on a length at middle and off, pushed into the covers"
43,"Jordan to Stoinis, SIX runs that's a strong shot! A fraction short from Jordan and Stoinis latches on with a dismissive pull in front of square"

45,"Jordan to Stoinis, no run more good work by the captain, diving to his left at cover to intercept a drive"
46,"Jordan to Stoinis, 2 runs on the pads, worked through midwicket where Bairstow collects in the deep"
47,"Jordan to Stoinis, 2 runs cloths this lofted drive, but manages to clear mid-off on the edge of the ring. A slower ball from Jordan and Stoinis was through his shot"
48,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run very full, wide outside off, swung down to long-on as he swings across the line"
49,"Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run full toss wide outside off, driven very firmly at cover and this has done some damage to Morgan. Looks like a finger on his right hand. Maybe a dislocation? Physio is straight out there"

64,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run floated up and driven through the off side"
65,"Rashid to Stoinis, no run Rashid's googly beats Stoinis on the inside - umpire Burns says no! Maybe outside the line, Stoinis completely foxed there, he's been done that way before... but no review from England. Hawk-Eye says it was bouncing over leg stump"
66,"Jordan to Finch, no run back of a length, 80mph/129kph and Finch taps it down defensively"
67,"Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs swatted over backward square leg! Picked up and he finds the gap, using Jordan's pace and incoming angle to good effect"

70,"Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs slower ball, Finch didn't seem to pick it but managed to adjust, heaved through backward square again! Lost his shape but managed to hoick four more"
71,"Jordan to Finch, OUT dragged on! Short ball, coming back in at pace, Finch seems surprised by it and can only chop down into his timbers! Jordan roars in celebration, that's a big breakthrough, with Australia rebuilding nicely"
72,"Rashid to Stoinis, SIX runs lummoxed over long-off! Doesn't matter about picking 'em if you get to the pitch and hit that sweetly through the line!"

76,"Rashid to Stoinis, 2 runs full, wide of the stumps, tempting Stoinis out and he chips up and over cover towards the sweeper"
77,"Rashid to Stoinis, OUT steered to slip, Rashid again finishes his spell with a wicket! Stoinis hangs his head but that was indicative of his struggles against spin... hung back, spotted too late that it was a big-turning legbreak, could only watch in horror as he directed it straight to Malan, diving to his right"

86,"Ali to Maxwell, 1 run over the wicket, worked off the stumps to leg"

89,"Ali to Maxwell, 1 run pushed through outside off, Maxwell opens the face and steers one square"

109,"Jordan to Maxwell, OUT heaves at a length ball, nicked to the keeper! Unusual dismissal at this stage of the innings, but it'll work for England... Jordan hitting that hard length again, as he did at the death on Friday, and Maxwell is too leg side as he swings for the hills and edges through. Was seeing it well, but that's going to dent Australia's hopes of getting 150"
110,"Jordan to Cummins, 1 run pitched up and dinked into the covers for a single"

121,"Archer to Agar, OUT goes back to basics, nails the 92mph/148kph yorker... and then runs Agar out as he comes looking for the single! He made an instinctive move out of his crease, even as the ball went straight back to the bowler. Archer dismissively pings the stumps, but this has been a good over for Australia"
122,"Archer to Starc, 2 runs fullish length, 91mph and Starc hacks across the line, gets a thick inside edge, and they'll scamper two to finish an 18-run over. How crucial will that be?"
123,"3.58pm: Well, that's a score to defend, Australia certainly the happier after being 30 for 3 inside the Powerplay. The pitch looked a little tough to time shots on and although England bowled very well in patches, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell and Ashton Agar helped cobble an innings together. With the bowlers Australia have, this could well be another close one. Don't go anywhere"
124,"Hello folks, Gnasher back with you. Think this is a decent total in the end. We shall see..."
125,"Starc to Buttler, 1 run over the wicket, short of a length, played with a straight bat and it runs off a thick inside edge to the leg side"
126,"Starc to Bairstow, no run huge appeal for lbw! Full, swings in at leg stump, probably doing too much as Bairstow plays across the line but Finch has called the review. Takes the back leg in the end. Yep, missing leg stump. Umpires' call on impact as well for what it's worth"

128,"Starc to Bairstow, no run good length at middle and leg, hint of swing, takes the pad again"

131,"Cummins to Buttler, no run good start, back of a length, hits the bat hard as Buttler defends to the on side"

134,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run good length outside off, angled into backward point. A direct hit from Maxwell and they'll check with the third umpire. Buttler didn't ground his bat, just ran across the crease, but got his foot down well in time"

138,"Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs that's a better shot! Full outside off, a fantastically crisp straight drive rockets off his bat"
139,"Starc to Bairstow, no run tries again, but loses his shape this time, the bottom hand drags this into the leg side"

146,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, no run short of a length at off stump, a bottom-handed flick into midwicket...four dot balls in a row"
147,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, SIX runs and that breaks the run of dots...a dismissive thump over mid-on from a perfectly good length delivery, Buttler got onto the front foot and crunched it down the ground. Into the rope on the full"

157,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 run goes for it again, a full toss this time, Buttler misses out as he finds cover with the drive...Agar intercepts with a dive"
158,"Cummins to Malan, no run ouch! Malan misses the pull and gets whacked in the stomach You could hear the cry of 'oh, no'"

173,"Zampa to Malan, 1 run full at middle, clipped down the ground to long-on. Good start from Zampa. Back-to-back tight overs from spin"
174,"Maxwell to Malan, FOUR runs goes for the reverse sweep, gets it over point and places it well enough to beat deep cover running around the rope"
175,"Maxwell to Malan, FOUR runs back-to-back boundaries...excellent footwork, moves to the leg side, opens up the off and square cuts wide of backward point"
