He did not get enough distance and Smith settles under it at deep midwicket to swallow the catch"
237,"Faulkner to Pandey, FOUR runs four runs for Pandey. Very full and wide, Pandey cuts powerfully past point for a boundary. 300 up for India"
238,"Faulkner to Pandey, OUT another one goes. Pandey this time. Length delivery on middle, Pandey wanted to go through midwicket but the legcutter stopped in the wicket a touch to take the top edge of Pandey, the ball carries to long-off who takes another easy one"
239,"Faulkner to Jadeja, 2 runs another slower delivery on middle, Jadeja clips in the gap in front of midwicket for a couple"
240,"Hastings to Ashwin, 1 run length delivery outside off, Ashwin runs at the bowler to push to point"
241,"Hastings to Jadeja, 1 run full delivery on off, Jadeja gets bat on the ball to point for one. Seems a concerted effort to at least get a run a ball"
242,"Hastings to Ashwin, OUT gone. Ashwin goes now. Full delivery on off, Ashwin walks across to ramp to fine leg but the ball deviates away only to take the top edge, the ball spoons up for short third man to take."
243,"Hastings to Jadeja, 2 runs low full toss, pushed to long-on for a run. Marsh returns an awkward throw to Hastings who can't collect cleanly. An overthrow is conceded"
244,"Hastings to Jadeja, no run full and wide yorker, Jadeja goes for a cheeky ramp. But misses"
245,"Hastings to Jadeja, OUT excellent last over from Hastings. Just four runs off it. Yorker on off, Jadeja digs it out back to the bowler. Hastings collects and takes off the bails."
246,"4.55pm Australia bounce back very well in the death, to keep India to 308. That total seemed good for 320, maybe more, going into the last 10 overs. India dominated the first 40 overs though as Rohit Sharma strolled to yet another ODI hundred, his second in the series. He was given able company first by Virat Kohli who compiled a close-to-flawless innings before"
247,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 run the short balls keep a'comin. So much that Finch needs to leap off his feet to get on top of this one on leg stump and nudges it to long leg"
248,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run 138 kph, a little quicker than Marsh anticipated. The shortish delivery zips off the deck, as it can happen under lights, and ducks back in at him. Goes for the pull, but is barely into position by the time the ball hits his side"
249,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, 1 run eases the ball off his thighs behind square leg to get off strike. Rohit puts in the slide to keep it to a single"
250,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run that's always a threat with the left-armer. The sucker ball outside off, especially in limited-overs cricket with the new ball. Finch wants to take it over extra, big booming drive comes calling, nobody home"
251,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run good length ball on and around fifth stump, Finch covers his stumps and shoulders arms"
252,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 2 runs short and on middle, Finch has no trouble directing it to long leg and picking up a second run"
253,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 wide penalised by the ump for straying a bit too far outside off. Marsh realises he can do nothing and give Australia a run for the chase"
254,"Sharma to Marsh, no run just back of a length and outside off, Marsh shuffles across a tad and lets it through"
255,"Sharma to Marsh, no run short and wide, Marsh should have banished that to the point boundary. But since his feet aren't quite moving yet, he hits it straight to Jadeja"
256,"Sharma to Marsh, FOUR runs too easy. Ishant loses his line, Marsh makes sure it hurts with a little tickle down to the fine leg boundary. India are struggling to stay one side of the wicket in the first few overs"
257,"Sharma to Marsh, no run gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump"
258,"Sharma to Marsh, no run that's better. Starts the ball on leg stump, which is more or less perfect for the angle across the left-hander. Marsh is squared up as he defends off the back foot. Now if he can get that ball fuller..."
259,"Sharma to Marsh, no run that was travelling, and Jadeja dives to his left to stop a certain boundary. Ishant strays short and wide and this time Marsh moves back and across to pounce. He had nearly placed it wide of the fielder, but a fit Jadeja is a tough man to beat"
260,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run lovely bowling, that's what you want your new-ball bowler to do. Bowl fullish, get the batsman forward but not give him the drive, then coax a lifeless pitch into offering some seam away. Finch is beaten. Soundly"
261,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run back-to-back beauties! Sran has begun an excellent over, starting on off stump, sucking the batsman into a front-foot defence, and beating him with seam away off the deck"
262,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run that cut back in to Finch! It was shortish and pitched wider of off stump, so Finch had set up for the cut. In the end he ends up with an inside edge"
263,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run"
264,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 leg bye a few inches fuller on middle and leg, which is the reason why Finch is caught in the crease and hurries to bring his bat down. So it comes through across the line and hits him in the pads. Loads of questions being asked"
265,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run and he finishes it by maintaining that teasing line just outside off to the left-hander too. A touch short, and hint of shape away. The only thing in favour of the batsman there was the length - short - so even though he is squared up, he can stay on the back foot and block"
266,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run tap and run cricket from Australia. Finch steps forward to put the ball into the covers and Marsh answers before Pandey running in could become a threat"
267,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run ooh, Marsh is not sure about this, but Finch was the man running to the danger end and he was never in doubt. It's a back of a length ball that cramps the batsman, who gets an inside edge and the ball had stopped a foot or so away from Marsh. Ishant attempted a run out by kicking the ball at the stumps, but ends up stomping on it"
268,"Sharma to Finch, no run"
269,"Sharma to Finch, 1 wide hits a good length, ball kisses the pitch and seams down leg. Finch tries to use the pace and send it to the long leg boundary. Has to settle for a wide"
270,"Sharma to Finch, no run much better from Ishant, summons a good length ball at 135 kph and gets it to dart back into Finch. Batsman knows this period is dicey and he blocks into the midwicket region. Good little skirmish this"
271,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run gets across on onto off stump and flicks the ball to the man at long leg."
272,"Sharma to Marsh, no run that's good. India needs to stay there to both batsman, perhaps at a fuller length. Marsh is squared up again, but because it is short, he can adjust and soften his hands to ensure the away swinger is easily blunted to point"
273,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run shades of how he got out in Perth! Takes a fuller ball outside off and slugs it back down the ground. The bat turns on impact, because he was concentrating on power, no caught and bowled this time though"
274,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run back of a length ball on off stump, blocked"
275,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run sneaks in the short ball, Finch saw the length early and on instinct went for the pull, but on the left-armer's angle that's a tough shot. Misses it"
276,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run fuller ball on off stump, tapped down the ground to mid-offf"
277,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 2 runs waits on the shortish delivery on off stump, moves across to off stump and pads it through midwicket"
278,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 run nicely done. Finch keeps to his back foot where both batsman have been comfortable and finds a single through midwicket."
279,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run not quite the room he thought it had, but Finch adjusts well enough. Jumps up to get on top of the shortish delivery on fifth stump and chops it to short third man"
280,"Sharma to Marsh, 3 runs the hit-me ball, and Marsh is only too happy to put it away through point. Sran at third man has a bit of work to do, and his being positioned squarer than usual helps. Solid cut shot"
281,"Sharma to Finch, no run he is still getting a little nip into the right-hander, Finch's body language suggests. Back of a length ball on off stump, blocked"
282,"Sharma to Finch, no run inside edge ruins Ishant's appeal, and Finch survives a skiddy indipper. Pitches the ball up a touch more, catches Finch on the crease and hitting across the line towards wide mid-on. A little quicker than that and he would have had him"
283,"Sharma to Finch, no run slower and a bit wider outside off, perhaps to suck him into a false shot, Finch is wary of the trap and leaves"
284,"Sharma to Finch, no run back of a length and outside off, pushed into the covers"
285,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, 1 run fuller delivery just outside off, Marsh runs it down to the other new-ball bowler Ishant at deep third man"
286,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 run got into position for the swivel pull in a flash, but he has picked out the deep fine leg fielder"
287,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run not quite short enough for the pull there, also this one zips into Marsh and cramps him for room. Mistimed to midwicket"
288,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run gets up on his toes to blunt the shortish delivery on middle and off to midwicket"
289,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run covers the line and blocks the short ball on fourth stump. Could do nothing more at this stage, with a slip still in"
290,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run Rohit continues to have an excellent match. Dives at midwicket to stop a Marsh pull that simply flew off the bat."
291,"Yadav to Finch, no run oooh, never give Finch width. He was going for the awayswinger, and he does get some curl, but Finch timed it excellently to cover"
292,"Yadav to Finch, no run goes short, but affords the width the batsman wants. Finch climbs into it, but he can't beat the offside ring"
293,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched into the covers. Straight at Kohli, who runs into the ball to stop the single. All looked well until the misfield"
294,"Yadav to Marsh, no run full and a bit outside off, pushed to mid-off. Kohli attempts to pull something out of the hat with a direct hit at the non-strikers' and he may well had caught Finch out!"
295,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run picked away to deep square leg, simple option with the length short and the line down leg"
296,"Yadav to Finch, no run on off stump and on a good length. Finch presents the full face."
297,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run starts on middle and Marsh had already set up to flick the ball around the corner and had to delay his shot"
298,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run chops a short and wide ball through the wide open space at cover"
299,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run a touch too straight again and Marsh keeps on his back foot to secure the easy single to deep midwicket"
300,"Jadeja to Finch, no run turn! bounce! Hope for India! Dhoni was unable to keep to it, that's how surprising it was. But he should like this development. The ball pitched on a good length and simply took off past the outside edge, puff of dust and all"
301,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run tossed up outside off, belted down the ground to long-on. Just to make sure the bowler doesn't get carried away."
302,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run picked away off his pads to deep square leg"
303,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run dangerous little cut shot because that ball was rather full, Marsh manages to slice it to point"
304,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run tossed up on middle and leg, defended"
305,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run eases down the pitch and drives through the covers. Careful shot that. Made sure he didn't get carried away"
306,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run plants that front foot outside off to lap sweep a flighted delivery from outside off. Jaddu is the man prowling around there and he keeps it to one"
307,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run goes straight on with the arm and with Marsh looking to play around his front pad, he gets nothing on it"
308,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run held this back a touch and that's why Marsh is unsure of the shot he wants. Came forward and then had to wait for the ball, which bounces a tad too. Hits him high on the splice and finds a single at cover"
309,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run goes for the sweep, may have had a tickle on it because the umpire didn't call it a wide. Dhoni doesn't miss many behind the stumps to the spinner"
310,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run drops a sitter, and Ishant has to suffer a round of boos. This was coming at a lovely height, straight at him at long-on. Marsh had wanted to break free, ran down the pitch and lofted the ball. Didn't connect well enough, but gets a lovely, large slice of luck"
311,"Jadeja to Finch, no run good length ball that rips away from Finch, who reaches out to block"
312,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run worked past midwicket"
313,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run tossed up, slotted into the covers"
314,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run shortish, picked away through midwicket"
315,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run good length ball on and around off stump, defended"
316,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run holds on the pitch, and ends up ripe for a flat-batted pull to long-on"
317,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 leg bye some turn, but of the slow kind, as Finch stays on his back foot and nudges it around the corner"
318,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run goes flatter and quicker on middle and leg, Marsh who was making room suddenly has none. defends"
319,"Ashwin to Marsh, FOUR runs a full blooded cut, from leg stump, gets a thick edge that bursts through slip. Rahane was the man who shoots his hands up to try and contrive a chance, but this was as much a catch as I am a hippopotamus."
320,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run flighted outside off, Marsh drives through extra cover"
321,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run 92 kph, gets some turn, but it suits the batsman. Marsh waits for it on the back foot and hits with it to deep midwicket"
322,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run backs away to cut a shortish delivery from off stump to the sweeper cover"
323,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run fired in at 94 kph, on middle and leg, punched back down the ground"
324,"Jadeja to Finch, 2 runs perhaps that's why Finch went for the slog and ends up with an inside edge. It still fetches a couple of runs to deep square leg"
325,"Jadeja to Finch, no run nice and tight on middle and off, Finch went back and bunts it down the pitch. Doesn't like that it offers him nothing"
326,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run moves away to cut a shortish delivery from the stumps to deep point."
327,"Ashwin to Finch, no run picks the shortish length quickly, clears his front leg and cuts to cover. Nicely done."
328,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run lunges outside off to sweep the tossed up ball outside off to deep fine leg"
329,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run too short again, Marsh has an easy punt to deep long-on"
330,"Ashwin to Finch, no run turning into off stump, off a good length ball too, that's why Finch can't connect with his cut properly"
331,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run huge appeal from Ashwin as Finch sets up for a lap sweep, but the shortish, straight one on middle, had taken enough of an inside edge before it hit pad. Single to fine leg"
332,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run gently eased to long-off to wrap up the over"
333,"Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs short, wide, hammered. And so early had he seen this buffey ball that Marsh has clomped the ball past mid-off"
334,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 leg bye 142 kph, hurries Marsh because his line threatens middle stump. That bit of extra pace makes him indecisive and the way he makes up for it is by playing across the line. Hit on the thigh, but Finch saves his partner by rushing across for a single"
335,"Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye tickled away to fine leg, no bat though"
336,"Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs slower ball, but he has lost control of it. Marsh has no trouble putting the misdirected offcutter where it deserves to go - to the fine leg boundary"
337,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run on the pads again, flicked to deep square leg"
338,"Yadav to Finch, no run full and just outside off, dug out to mid-on and Finch inspects the bottom of the bat after the fact"
339,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run tossed up on middle and leg, sent back where it came from"
340,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run quick feet puts Marsh waiting for the late cut, but he has found backward point"
341,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run that bat was a little straighter because the ball was a touch fuller on off stump, pushed to deep point"
342,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run misfield from the bowler allows Finch to get off strike. Good ball too, full on off stump, only allowed Finch a drive down the ground. Could have been for nothing"
343,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run straying down leg, clipped through midwicket"
344,"Ashwin to Finch, no run deftly worked to midwicket and was prepared to run, until he realised that man was in close and it was Virat Kohli"
345,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 leg bye oh, you have to say that was well done from Marsh. Came in second best as a 142kph shortish delivery cramps him for room. The ball wanders into the off side after hitting his body, Finch pulls him across for a quick single and Marsh makes sure he saves himself from a run-out. Ran in a perfectly straight line, trouble happens on"
346,"Yadav to Finch, no run full and curling in at the right-hander, Finch is all over the pace as he tries to flick across the line. Hits the front pad and weathers an lbw appeal"
347,"Yadav to Finch, no run gets up on top of a short ball outside off and chops it to point. Should have at least got one there"
348,"Yadav to Finch, no run pushes the ball a touch fuller on middle and off, and its 142 kph too, so Finch who was trying for a clip through square leg finds the ball ending up at midwicket because it hit the bat too high"
349,"Yadav to Finch, 2 runs he isn't holding himself back, that's for sure. Takes on the short ball even though he has not timed too many in this innings. Mis-hits the pull and gets a couple over midwicket"
350,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run jumps back and flicks the shortish ball through to deep square leg"
351,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run presses forward and pats the flighted delivery to long-on"
352,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run tries to cut the ball off himself, but the nudge towards mid-on beats him"
353,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run waits for the shortish ball to turn into him and then ease it behind square leg"
354,"Ashwin to Marsh, 3 runs that's good shot. He's tried a similar shot before, but the late cut found point. Now Marsh backs away, cuts the ball, it turns away from the sweeper as it gathers speed as Dhoni indicated, but Ishant is a bit too slow"
355,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run sweeps from outisde off to find a single at long leg"
356,"Ashwin to Marsh, no run flighted on middle, sent back down the pitch"
357,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run called early, response immediate, quick single pinched without the ball going three feet from the stumps"
358,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run fullish on middle and leg, Marsh has only managed an inside edge onto pad, and yet he finds himself with a single to midwicket. Australia have decided no more dot balls. He's hurt himself as well, playing the flick. The bat just jammed onto his leg because he was hurried into the shot"
359,"Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs shuffles across and finds a smart boundary at long leg. Smart because he knows he is not going to get too many freebies outside off, but when he does get that one straying down leg, he makes sure to put it away"
360,"Yadav to Finch, no run jumps back on middle and leg to put the shortish ball to midwicket"
361,"Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs lifts the fuller ball down the ground, and he had to put in every bit of his strength because the bat turns in his hand. Nowhere near the timing he can generate, but he is still somehow making it work."
362,"Yadav to Finch, SIX runs how about that! He reaches fifty with a shot that has the stamp of a batsman in plundering form. It was length, tailing into him, Finch moved his front leg across and a good old whip(lash) of the wrists takes the ball soaring over square leg"
363,"Ashwin to Marsh, 2 runs oh, that's a seriously risky single! Marsh had deflected the ball towards fine leg and is pulled into a quick single. They take on a fast bowler's arm - Yadav's - but Ashwin doesn't want to. He thinks this will be a direct hit and simply stepped away from the stumps. No backing up either, so they get a second when this should have"
364,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run short and wide outside off, cut away to Ishant at deep point. That's Marsh's fifty as well"
365,"Ashwin to Finch, 2 runs tossed up outside off and Finch loves the width on offer. Leans forward and chips the ball over extra cover. Rohit does well to keep the ball inside the boundary"
366,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs ohhh, that is clever. He knew third man was up, he saw this short and wide and he delayed the cut shot just enough to pick the gap behind point"
367,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run goes for the sweep and gets enough of an inside edge to find a single at fine leg"
368,"Ashwin to Marsh, 1 run flighted outside off, driven to long-off"
369,"Jadeja to Marsh, FOUR runs more punishment. Marsh gets deep in his crease and short-arm jabs a boundary over wide long-on"
370,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run flat, sharp delivery on middle and leg, picked through midwicket"
371,"Jadeja to Finch, FOUR runs brilliant! He has been buying his runs any way he could, from any edge he could so far, and having been there for so long, he has suddenly figured out the trick to his timing. Jumped back to make a shortish ball even shorter and cuts it behind point"
372,"Jadeja to Finch, FOUR runs disdain! That's what I saw in Finch's eyes as he watched the ball sail into the midwicket fence. Got to the pitch and all he did was power the ball away with his wrists"
373,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run patted down the ground now that he's struck two fours earlier"
374,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run pushed through on off stump, and yet there remains a single before the cover fielder can catch up to it. Australia have made their move. India have become scatterbrained. They need to slow this game down or the hosts can simply ride this wave all the way to the end"
375,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 wide 141kph, that's been India's problem. They haven't been able to concentrate enough balls on one side of the wicket. This one is short and slips down leg. Marsh goes for the swivel pull and misses."
376,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run ooooh, Sran nearly had it! He nearly had a catch to remember until the end of time. Marsh had timed the leather off this short ball and the pull had four, maybe even six, all over it. But in pops the left-arm fast bowler, dives and is horizontal with the ground when he grabbed the ball with two hands. But it pops out"
377,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run gets away to the other end with a single to long-off"
378,"Yadav to Marsh, no run back of a length on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
379,"Yadav to Marsh, no run chopped to point, Marsh was looking for the single to the sweeper but hit it off the bottom of the bat"
380,"Yadav to Marsh, 2 runs two they call after Marsh works it off his pads, and two they take even with one of the better Indian fielders on the square leg boundary. Pandey ran in and sent a flat throw to the bowler's end, but Finch had made it safely"
381,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 wide time for the swivel pull, but it was a little too far wide of him to connect"
382,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run pat and run, this is excellent cricket from the Australians. And the best description of their pace between the pitch is that Finch and Marsh have been able to beat Jadeja at point"
383,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run tossed up on off stump, given a home at long-on"
384,"Jadeja to Finch, no run flighted outside off, driven to extra cover"
385,"Jadeja to Finch, no run just short enough that Finch can go back and carve the ball to point"
386,"Jadeja to Finch, 2 runs if the ball had a voice, it would be squealing. Finch moves a touch to the leg side and smears it through extra cover. Rahane needed the dive to stop that from going to the boundary"
387,"Jadeja to Finch, OUT that's the Test world-record holder! Rahane has pulled off a blinder at long-off! This was another that Finch thought he could smoke over extra, and so he did. Except this time he had hit it in the air and gave that fielder a chance. Rahane moves swiftly to his left, eyes on the ball all the way, dives forward and grabs the ball inche"
388,"Jadeja to Smith, no run tossed up on off stump, solid defence from Smith"
389,"Sharma to Marsh, no run and the fielders recognise the importance of this phase. Jaddu swoops in on this front-foot defence from Marsh and stops the two Australians from going for a single"
390,"Sharma to Marsh, no run back of a length and wicket-to-wicket, Marsh can't do no more than block it"
391,"Sharma to Marsh, 2 runs excellent cut shot, he seems to make sure to bring that bat down as late as possible to get the most runs off that late cut whether it is pace or spin"
392,"Sharma to Marsh, no run good length ball on the stumps, Marsh knocks it back down the pitch"
393,"Sharma to Marsh, no run lifter! And it needed a good nut like that to beat Marsh's late cut. He had set himself up in a lovely position to guide the ball away, but Ishant has long had a secret little deal with Australia pitches wherein certain balls just burst off the deck and leave the batsman bemused"
394,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run shortish and outside off, run to point"
395,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run goes back and whips a shortish ball through to deep midwicket"
396,"Jadeja to Smith, no run flighted on off stump, defended back at the bowler"
397,"Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs just over short midwicket! Smith steps out of his crease, that by itself is a feat against the darts Jaddu bowls, and then he drags a ball from way outside off with impeccable timing over Pandey"
398,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run eases the ball through the covers"
399,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run turns a shortish delivery behind square leg"
400,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run flighted on middle, pushes to long-on and even runs showing the full face of the bat"
401,"Sharma to Smith, 1 wide banged in short, Smith steps inside the line to pull it away fine, not able to do so."
402,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run all he did was bring the bat down on top of the shortish ball outside off. Didn't even deign to move his feet"
403,"Sharma to Marsh, 2 runs back of a length and outside off, picked away past wide mid-on"
404,"Sharma to Marsh, no run pleasant drive off the front foot and Dhawan puts in the dive at mid-off to stop the runs"
405,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run that slip had been in business! Pandey flew low to his left, got both hands to it, but he can't hold onto it. Irony for Ishant. After he had dropped a dolly, he gets a toughie dropped off him. Amid all that, how could Marsh simply guide the ball there like it was catching practice. Did he not see the slipper?"
406,"Sharma to Smith, 2 runs beautiful cricket from Smith. He's been on Sran's case since the last game, and this time he takes on the young fast bowler's arm and turns a late cut for one into a late cut for a briskly run two"
407,"Sharma to Smith, no run fullish and outside off, pasted away to mid-on"
408,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run goes back to the flatter one and pushes to midwicket"
409,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run a little slower, and a bit more flight. Midwicket comes into play again"
410,"Jadeja to Marsh, no run worked into midwicket again as Marsh does not have any room to work it"
411,"Jadeja to Marsh, 1 run a frustrated swipe across the line of the ball gets a toe end and becomes a single to point"
412,"Jadeja to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, goes for the cut and misses"
413,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run flighted onto the pads, whipped away to deep midwicket"
414,"Sharma to Smith, no run fullish and just outside off, defended towards cover"
415,"Sharma to Smith, no run stands up tall behind a short of a length ball and guide it to cover point"
416,"Sharma to Smith, no run punched to short cover as Ishant keeps a steady line on off stump"
417,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run nicely done. Ishant saw Smith moving away outside leg and followed him with a fuller ball. Keeps it to a single to mid-off"
418,"Sharma to Marsh, OUT hurries him, leading edge, taken by Kohli! That's the bowling leader India want, the man who can dismiss the set batsman. Marsh had set up for the clip through midwicket, but the shortish ball holds on the pitch and comes up with a bit too much height on it. He can't control the shot, he has lost his balance, he pops a high catch to s"
419,"Sharma to Bailey, no run just back of a good length on off stump, defended"
420,"Barinder Sran to Smith, 2 runs offers probably the worst ball he could to Smith - short and wide - hammered to point who does excellently well to get a hand on it. It we had Hot-Spotted that, the ball would have left a streak as it went after Jaddu"
421,"Barinder Sran to Smith, no run sets up for the pull a touch too early, and the short ball from Sran arrives late enough to get the Australia captain's inside edge"
422,"Barinder Sran to Smith, 1 run opens himself up and pulls a short ball from outside off through midwicket"
423,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 3 runs that's got the imprint of a man in form. Bailey presses forward fluently and threads the gap at cover. Yadav on the cover boundary only just manages to cut to his right and stop it"
424,"Barinder Sran to Smith, no run moves across outside off and slides a shortish delivery off the open face to point."
425,"Barinder Sran to Smith, 2 runs moves onto off stump, so Sran has to bowl even further outside off. Pierces the field at cover again"
426,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run keeps the ball on a good length on middle, Bailey whips it away through midwicket"
427,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run punched to long-on as Ashwin keeps from flighting the ball"
428,"Ashwin to Bailey, 4 runs moves across, and forward, plants the bat down like a ramp for the ball to jump off of. But it hits nothing and Dhoni who had expected the batsman to connect with the lap sweep had moved too far to his left to collect that"
429,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run gets down the track and flicks the ball through midwicket"
430,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run eased to the yawning gap at deep midwicket again"
431,"Ashwin to Bailey, no run tossed up on middle, worked to midwicket"
432,"Barinder Sran to Smith, 1 run back of a length and outside off, sliced into the covers"
433,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 1 run short and wide, Bailey goes for the cut and gets a thick outside edge that flies to third man"
434,"Barinder Sran to Smith, no run mistimes an off drive, and it is an off drive even though Smith had cleared his front leg and was playing it off the back foot to a fuller ball outside off"
435,"Barinder Sran to Smith, (no ball) moves well across his off stump, Sran moves even wider with his short ball, Smith still goes for a pull and toe-ends the ball into the off side. Oh, amid all that, the bowler has overstepped, so it's a free hit"
436,"Barinder Sran to Smith, 1 run 92 kph, might have been the back of the hand slower ball that went awry. Smith had loaded up his baseball stance and stood waiting for it for an age before he toe-ends this too down the ground"
437,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, FOUR runs belts the cross-seamer down the ground! Overpitched and Bailey dials the sightscreen perfectly"
438,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, no run short and wide, Bailey finds point with the cut"
439,"Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs chipped to mid-on and and in the time it takes for that man to jump off the boundary and come to the ball, they get a couple. Rohit is not the slowest fielder, mind"
440,"Ashwin to Smith, no run flighted delivery outside off, defended into the covers"
441,"Ashwin to Smith, no run goes back to a fullish delivery and punches the ball, whilst leaving all his stumps open, to cover"
442,"Ashwin to Smith, no run leans on his front foot and picks the fielder at midwicket"
443,"Ashwin to Smith, no run tries to place this to long-on and find the single he wanted. But Kohli cuts across and stops all that"
444,"Ashwin to Smith, no run oooh, that was close. Ashwin had seen Smith making room and followed him, gets some turn off the deck as well, and beats the push into the covers. Good take from Dhoni behind the stumps"
445,"Kohli to Bailey, 1 run heaved away to deep midwicket, mistimed badly"
446,"Kohli to Smith, 1 run full and wide outside off, Smith slaps it down the ground to long-off"
447,"Kohli to Bailey, no run gets an inside edge as he tries to reach for a full and wide one outside off"
448,"Kohli to Smith, FOUR runs that's poor, but expected from the part-timer. Drops this short and Smith creams it through midwicket."
449,"Kohli to Smith, no run oooh, inside edge! The result of Smith playing back to something he should have been forward to. Tries to slice the ball through point and it ends up missing the off stump by a whisker"
450,"Ashwin to Bailey, no run down the track, but he can't reach the pitch. Well bowled by Ashwin, denies room and the leverage. No run to midwicket"
451,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run so he goes for the sweep, the escape shot against non-turning off spin, but here it bounces. And Bailey gets a top edge for a single"
452,"Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs dabbed into the leg side, and since the fielders are all on the boundary, Smith can rush back for a second."
453,"Ashwin to Smith, no run clipped straight to Dhawan in front of the square leg ump"
454,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run Jaddu has been placed there just for this shot, Smith lunges across and sweeps powerfully. Looked like four to his left, but he races across and keeps it to one"
455,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run full and on middle, whipped through midwicket"
456,"Yadav to Bailey, no run full on off, a hint of inward movement to Bailey who confidently drives to mid-off"
457,"Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs just wide of point. Good length outside off, Bailey flays a cut in the air but evading point. Third man cleans up but the pair get two"
458,"Yadav to Bailey, no run good delivery. Fuller than a good length on off, Bailey stays in his crease to block to cover"
459,"Yadav to Bailey, FOUR runs picked his shot, picked his delivery and executed perfectly. Backed away, saw the delivery a touch too short and swatted the ball over mid-on with enviable nonchalance. Shot."
460,"Yadav to Bailey, no run back of a length outside off, Bailey tries to dab to third man but the ball zips past Bailey's attempted late cut"
461,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run steered comfortably to third man from the crease"
462,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run floated up on off, drilled to long-on with the turn"
463,"Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs chipped to long-on. Lovely batting, raced to the pitch and then just pushed the ball straight and stole a couple"
464,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run flatter on leg, pushed with the full face of the bat to long-on"
465,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run well bowled this time, drags his length back just a touch. Bailey runs down and inside-edges to square leg"
466,"Ashwin to Smith, FOUR runs what a shot that is. Not a bad delivery at all. Flat on middle, Smith hurries back and makes room for himself. Clobbers the cut deftly in the gap behind point for four"
467,"Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs two more. Flat on leg, Smith tickles it into the leg side and races back for the second. Easily done"
468,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run nope. It's a short one and Bailey has sliced it away to the sweeper cover"
469,"Yadav to Smith, no run how does he do that? Throws his front leg aside and goes to club the ball down the ground, when it was short of a length and barely a smidge outside off. Guess that's why he mistimed it"
470,"Yadav to Smith, 1 run now he jumps outside off and clips the very same ball - shortish and just outside off - to deep midwicket"
471,"Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs slapped away to Rahane on the point boundary, they go for the run on the throw and make it easily"
472,"Yadav to Bailey, no run full and seemed to tail in a touch, Bailey is not bothered at all as he hammers it to mid-off"
473,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run oh, so simply, deftly, effortlessly done. All Bailey did was step forward and block a good length ball. That's playing to merits. But so well had he placed it - right between cover and mid-off - and so deftly had he touched it, that he is at the other end before any fielder can reach the ball. Brilliant."
474,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 wide slower ball slides down the leg side, Bailey can't get the tickle he wants but can still be happy Australia get runs and an extra ball"
475,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs jittery old shot from Bailey, and Ishant has a forlorn look on his face as he watches the ball disappear to the long leg boundary. What more can he do? Put the ball on a good length and made the batsman uncertain. Bailey attempts a defensive push, but he had no balance doing so and left a big gap to boot. Doesn't happen"
476,"Sharma to Bailey, no run a little legcutter from Ishant, which gets the edge as Bailey tries to put it to third man, but dies on its way to the keeper"
477,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run a lot more width outside off and he is able to guide the ball through to deep third man"
478,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs smeared down the ground! Ishant got a hand to it - it could only have been a reflex catch and he has a history of not being able to pull those off - but testament to how little chance he had that is because Ashwin running back from mid-off can't get to it"
479,"Sharma to Smith, 1 run full and wide outside off - because Smith made it so by opening up his stance - carved to mid-off. Gee, he looks like a cave man swinging his club."
480,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run rises up to his ribcage, but Bailey gets on top of it and blunts it towards the square leg region"
481,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run width offered and Bailey goes after it with a flay over point"
482,"Yadav to Smith, 1 run good length ball on middle and off, Smith puts it to long-on"
483,"Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs picks up the short ball and jabs it away between deep midwicket and deep long-on"
484,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run shortish and sliding down, Bailey pulls to long leg"
485,"Yadav to Smith, OUT zips through and topples off! There's the danger of showing off your stumps to a fast bowler. He had hit a cut shot off a delivery on middle against Ashwin, tried to repeat that against Yadav, who bowls it on a good length and gets the ball to skid through to beat his self-inflicted and limited defences"
486,"Yadav to Maxwell, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked under his eyes"
487,"Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run down the track, gets a touch too close to the flat delivery outside off, and drives to long-off"
488,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run goes back against the good length ball and blocks it"
489,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run defends a fuller delivery on off stump without moving his feet. Premeditating that Jaddu will bowl flat"
490,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 2 runs leading edge flies away to the sweeper in the deep. Loads of wristwork behind the shot as he tries to lift the ball over the off side infield"
491,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run pulls out the reverse sweep, and its only his fifth ball in. Manages to lob the infield again even though he didn't connect well"
492,"Jadeja to Bailey, no run leans forward and blocks on middle and leg"
493,"Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run ooh, that wasn't the most comfortable little guide to third man. Yadav slings down a 143 kph back of a length delivery right over off stump and it almost seemed like Maxwell had decided he would play no other shot"
494,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run a little more width there which allows Bailey to carve the ball behind point"
495,"Yadav to Maxwell, 3 runs thumped over cover, and only Rahane and that large boundary over there prevents the four. Again, he barely moved his feet but was able to adjust with his hands"
496,"Yadav to Bailey, no run a little too short and just outside off, Bailey is hardly even interested"
497,"Yadav to Bailey, FOUR runs past the wicketkeeper! Hale and healthy nick as Bailey looks to hammer it down the ground, but the fuller ball ends up 180 degrees behind him. Dhoni went up, a tad slow, and to his right but can't reach it"
498,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run slotted behind square leg to retain strike"
499,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, SIX runs picked up the slower ball and launched it into the crowd beyond long-off. Absolutely serene, and just about the perfect way to reach his fifty. Lovely stride forward, full swing of the arms, simply put away"
500,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 1 run shortish and outside off, slower again, pulled to deep midwicket"
501,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, no run 116 kph, that time the offcutter works because he puts it on a good length and slants it across the new batsman, instead of the set one. Maxwell is beaten"
502,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run back to normal pace on middle and leg, Maxwell clips it away to to long leg"
503,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, FOUR runs with him bowling slower balls third man was in and the straight fielders were back. The problem here was Sran's slower ball was short and wide and Bailey simply tucked in with a cut shot over the infield"
504,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 1 run good length ball on middle and leg, nudged into the midwicket region"
505,"Sharma to Bailey, no run almost! Bailey prefers to stay beside the ball, which pitches on a good length and holds its line. No luck with the edge, worse luck with the off stump, all it eventually hits is Dhoni's gloves and it sounds so hollow as India's hopes slip"
506,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run neat little nudge through the midiwcket region. There's only on man up in the circle at that region"
507,"Sharma to Maxwell, 2 runs picks up the short ball early enough to pull it miles in front of square. Manish Pandey is the man running across from midwicket and needs to put in the full-length dive"
508,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run just back of a length on off stump, Maxwell gets in line with it and blocks. Once that's done he jogs the single as the ball meanders to long-on"
509,"Sharma to Bailey, 2 runs fullish on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg and they pinch a second."
510,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run sees the width, uses it to his advantage as he finds a single to deep third man. Keeping up with the required rate just by running their runs. Must be demoralising for a fielding team especially after putting up 300-plus"
511,"Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run flighted outside off, driven to long-off"
512,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run round-armed dart on middle and leg, cut away strongly to deep point"
513,"Jadeja to Bailey, no run a grunt from Jadeja as he pushes a good length ball on middle, defended"
514,"Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run down the track and drives the fuller ball on off stump to long-off"
515,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 2 leg byes did that get a little boot from Maxwell? Yep. Fired into the pads, goes for the standing swipe to long leg but it is too quick for him"
516,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run 101 kph, on middle and leg, picked away behind square leg"
517,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run excellent work from Jadeja at point. India are still trying. It shows in the batsman trying to cramp the batsman up, it shows in this big dive to his right as Jaddu stops a possible second run. But this is such a lovely batting deck. Just skims onto the bat with no sideways movement"
518,"Sharma to Bailey, no run patted into the covers as ishant goes for middle and leg and gets it to rise towards his thighs."
519,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 wide full and down leg, that's almost predictable considering India trying to stymie the runscoring by denying width"
520,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs Pandey signals it was four, but the way Bailey picked up that length ball and sent it soaring, I thought it was 12. Brilliant ball-striking."
521,"Sharma to Bailey, 2 runs Jadeja tracks it over his head, he is running back as hard as he could, sticks out a hand in desperation but the outside edge off a cramped up cut shot beats him."
522,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run backs away, but Ishant follows him with a short ball, pulled to wide long-on"
523,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide perhaps he was preempting Maxwell making room, because that's just a shocker of a slower ball down leg. Ishant's eighth wide of the day"
524,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run short of a length and outside off, clipped through midwicket with a gentle roll of the wrists"
525,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run short ball, swivel pulled to long leg"
526,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 1 run 109 kph offcutter just outside off, dabbed to short third man and they trot over for a single. Possible sign that India have given up because there should be no run there"
527,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run full toss, wide outside off, Maxwell looks to beat Ishant at short third man for his first boundary of the day, but he is unable to do so"
528,"Barinder Sran to Bailey, 1 run goes for the short ball outside off, pulled to deep square leg"
529,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, no run 126 kph, stays inside the line and looks to punch a short of a length delivery through the covers. No contact"
530,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, no run that's a 95 kph slower ball, Maxwell moves inside the line to lift it over the wicketkeeper. There is not enough pace to pull it off"
531,"Yadav to Bailey, 1 run inside edge to a 140 kph delivery just outside off, Bailey was all set for bash it through the covers. Has to settle for a single to Dhoni"
532,"Yadav to Maxwell, 2 runs full on middle and leg, Maxwell slaps it down the ground and gets a couple. Meanwhile, 300 up for the fourth time in four innings this series"
533,"Yadav to Maxwell, 2 runs full and outside off, Maxwell plants his back leg outside off and simply swings as hard as he could. So whilst he gets elevation, he has very little power. But massive luck as he splits three men tracking the skier down"
534,"Yadav to Maxwell, no run backs away to clatter a 142 kph short ball way outside off down the ground. Spectacularly beaten"
535,"Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR runs there is his first of the match, and scores are level. It's a short ball, Maxi camps back and pummels it wide of long-on"
536,"Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run patted to point, straight to Jaddu, would have been out had he hit the stumps, but he does not and Bailey gets across for an unbeaten fifty and the Australian win. That's the best chase at the Gabba as well, with an over to spare and nearly no doubt about the result."
537,"""It's always disappointing. At the end of the day, no matter how much you score. I love playing here. The wickets are good, you always get value for your shots and that's what I want to do. Once I'm in, I feel good enough to score big. Overall pleased with my form, but disappointing not to win. Looking forward to Melbourne now"""
538,"9.00 pm Another clinical chase on a straightforward track with India unable to summon any threat. We had been warned of this, but it is still a little scary that 300 is being gunned down like a walk in the park. Literally because this chase has been fed by singles and twos, just like the Perth one and yet again Rohit Sharma has to console himself with the Man of"
539,"So we have an India captain admitting 300 is not enough with their bowling. We have an Australian captain who is batting like he can't get out against India. And a 300-plus total gunned down with the greatest of ease. Basically a repeat of the first ODI, so people tuning in for Melbourne in a few days' time, better make sure you like deja vu. Until then, this is"
540,Australia won by 7 wickets (with 6 balls remaining)
541,"Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA"
