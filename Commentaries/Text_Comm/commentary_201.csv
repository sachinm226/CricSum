0,12.30pm Australia won the toss and chose to bat
1,"Abbott to Warner, FOUR runs what a start that is. Short and wide, the worst possible delivery to this guy. Warner laces the cut through point, with timing I didn't see too much in round 1"
2,"Abbott to Warner, no run another full outswinger, 147ks, encouraging carry to Wade, a far cry from the low bounce at the Providence. Ignored by the batsman again"
3,"Abbott to Warner, no run yorker, nudging 140ks, homing in on the off stump, squeezed out"
4,"Abbott to Warner, no run nicely bowled again. Just outside off - fifth-stump line and Warner defends again"
5,"Abbott to Warner, no run shapes this one away and starts it off on middle so that it goes to off. Warner blocks. Nice comeback"
6,"Abbott to Warner, FOUR runs poor delivery. So two bad deliveries gives Australia the start they wanted. Short and wide and Warner climbs all over it, thrashes a cut past point again, to the other side, more towards backward point"
7,"Rabada to Finch, no run full and wide outside off, Finch comes forward and leaves. Just a bit of away movement"
8,"Rabada to Finch, (no ball) overstepped. Can't do that KG. Back of a length outside off and Finch defends into the off side"
9,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR runs smears it to the midwicket boundary. Not a bad delivery actually, fullish on leg. Finch backs away and mis-times his lofted drive, all along the ground, through midwicket"
10,"Rabada to Finch, no run nice. Back of a length, swerves back in from outside off. Left alone"
11,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run nicely bowled. Attacking Finch's pads, but he is good enough to push to mid-on for a quick single. Good run"
12,"Rabada to Warner, no run back of a length on off,Warner blocks into the off side. Good, nagging lines"
13,"Rabada to Warner, no run superb stop. A boundary-saving dive from Parnell. Saved four in fact. Awesome. Short and wide from Rabada, and Warner cuts towards cover point where Parnell dives to his left and stops it"
14,"Abbott to Finch, no run a good length outside off, left alone. Finch showing some patience, could be a plan"
15,"Abbott to Finch, no run fullish on a fifth-stump line. Finch defends nicely"
16,"Abbott to Finch, no run hmm, shortish and wide outside off. Finch cuts but times it so badly that it doesn't leave the pitch."
17,"Abbott to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, pushed to cover from the crease. Abbott's lines are good so far to Finch"
18,"Abbott to Finch, no run nice again. A good length outside off, and Finch leaves. Not bowling it too full"
19,"Abbott to Finch, no run keeps it outside off, Finch lunges forward to punch into the off side. So tight that over was, maiden."
20,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs ooh, a bit of a sloppy misfield and four. Shortish and wide, didn't get the impression that he timed that too well. the cut went more towards cover where a bobble just in front of the fielder helps it take it past him"
21,"Rabada to Warner, no run back of a length on middle, dead-bat defense"
22,"Rabada to Warner, no run shortish and wide again, but not as wide. Warner chops a cut to cover point, dot ball"
23,"Rabada to Warner, no run full, maybe for the first time at that length. Warner stays back and pushes to mid-off. Not much movement for the SA bowlers"
24,"Rabada to Warner, SIX runs wow, gone all the way. Shortish on off, Warner pulls. So effortless, so lazy. Made sure he got his pull over square leg and even though he had to drag it from off, it goes well over."
25,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run good single. Fullish on off, tip and run to cover. Great"
26,"Abbott to Warner, no run nagging away at that off bail. Warner stays in his crease to tap to point."

29,"Abbott to Warner, 1 run this time he takes it off his pads and works to fine leg"
30,"Abbott to Finch, 1 run another sloppy misfield from Phangiso at cover. Punched to him from the back foot and he parries it towards mid-off. These two make the run easily"
31,"Abbott to Warner, no run keeps it on a good length on off, not much even Warner can do about that. Defends to point. Splendid over"
32,"Rabada to Finch, no run fullish outside off, Finch presses forward and defends"
33,"Rabada to Finch, no run back of a length on middle, jags back enough to take the ball past Finch's inside edge. Smashes into his thigh pad"
34,"Rabada to Finch, no run looking for that yorker. 149.5 kph. A full toss, Finch inside-edges into his pad. Rabada appeals vociferously but clearly a lot of bat"

36,"Rabada to Warner, no run speared in the blockhole again. 150.2 kph. Yikes, that's quick. Warner jams it out."
37,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run may have been out with a direct hit. Warner pushes a good length delivery towards short cover and calls for one. Rabada runs to the ball as the crow flies. As a result, Finch has to deviate off course slightly. rabada misses the stumps though at the batsman's end"
38,"Abbott to Warner, FOUR runs nowhere near the middle but four more. Shortish on Warner's pads and Warner is through his swivel-pull too early. Goes to midwicket instead of behind square. Four"

44,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs short and wide, smashed. Through point, four more. Not the right line. Warner stands tall and cuts it with ease"
45,"Rabada to Warner, no run keeps it tight on off. Nice line. Warner is forced to defend after looking to clip through the leg side"
46,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run shortish and wide, dabbed to third man after getting on top of the bounce. Good batting. Got it over the infield"
47,"Rabada to Finch, no run full on off, Finch pushes to mid-off from the crease"
48,"Rabada to Finch, (no ball) Rabada oversteps again. Not very good from him. Overly full outside off, Finch punches into the off side, where there is another parry to mid-off from cover"
49,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR runs shortish on off, Finch clears one foot, looks to smear over midwicket but is hurried for pace. As a result, the ball takes the top edge and flies over the keeper for four"

61,"Tahir to Warner, 1 run flat, very quick. 96 kph, punched to deep cover"
62,"Tahir to Finch, OUT gone. Finch persists with the sweep. Flat on off, the quicker delivery. Finch clears a front foot and tries to smash his sweep through square leg but was quite far from the ball. The ball missed his cross-batted swat and clattered into off stump. Tahir sets off in typical fashion. Finch struggled for any fluency in that knock."

296,"4.50pm Australia huffed and puffed to 288, just 103 off the last 15 overs and losing five wickets in that period. After Warner's sixth ODI ton, his first outside Australia, it looked like a score of 310 was on but they lost wickets and played out too many dots, losing plenty of momentum in the process.
