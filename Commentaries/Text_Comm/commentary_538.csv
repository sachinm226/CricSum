8,"Harwood to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor start for Harwood and Gibbs obliges a half volley by getting forward and timing it sweetly past the covers, no need to chase that"
9,"Harwood to Gibbs, 2 runs he overpitches on the pads this time and Gibbs works it wide of midwicket with little effort, Warner does the chasing"
10,"Harwood to Gibbs, 5 runs there's a direct hit but it's overthrows! Gibbs defends inside out to cover and sets off for a risky single, the ball hits the stumps at the striker's end and deflects to the third man fence and there's an appeal for the run out, he's safe"
