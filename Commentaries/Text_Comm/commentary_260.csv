Thinks abou"

40,"Willey to Bailey, no run off-stump line, this time Bailey covers it and defends"
41,"Willey to Bailey, no run slanted towards the slips on a length, hits the seam and straightens a tough but wide enough for Bailey to leave"
42,"Willey to Bailey, no run oh dear, what's Bailey done... he plants his front foot and raises his bat out of the way, hit bang on the knee roll. Dharmasena takes a few moments to mull it over before shaking his head. Probably didn't come back enough and England elect not to review, knowing it need"

51,"Willey to Finch, OUT goes on with the arm, Finch feels for it and nicks off!

236,"Ali to Bailey, 1 leg bye good late adjustment from Ali, who saw his man coming and speared it down the leg-side, looking for the stumping. Bailey got enough pad on it though"
237,"Ali to Marsh, 1 run chipped up towards mid-on, in the air for a while"
238,"Ali to Bailey, no run on a good length again, defended from the crease"
239,"Ali to Bailey, no run wider outside off stump, met with a fat front pad with bat tucked behind it, and in fact it's called as a dead ball for no stroke offered. A moot point."
240,"Ali to Bailey, no run defended again"
241,"Ali to Bailey, no run good delivery to finish, attacking the pads and no way to capitalise for the batsman"
242,"Plunkett to Marsh, OUT full, straight, chipped high and hard but only as far as David Willey at long-off who took a well-judged catch in the deep. Instant strike for England and that target of 300 takes a touch of a dent"
243,"Plunkett to Bailey, no run Bailey, the anchorman, defends down the track"
244,"Plunkett to Bailey, OUT gosh, now that changes things! Bailey was early onto the drive, the ball stopped in the pitch, popped up off the bat sticker, and straight back into the bowler's grateful mitts! England, it is fair to say, are bossing this Powerplay."
245,"Plunkett to Stoinis, no run a full face of the bat to launch his ODI career"
246,"Plunkett to Stoinis, no run pushed onto the back foot, but more reassuring bat on ball for the new boy"
247,"Plunkett to Stoinis, 1 run straighter onto the pads, turned round the corner for a single. Lovely over for England's ambitions. Two wickets and one run."
248,"Ali to Stoinis, 3 runs"
249,"Ali to Wade, no run another dot to the scorebook. Ali finding a probing length"
250,"Ali to Wade, 1 run pushed out to point, a hint of width"
251,"Ali to Stoinis, OUT reverse sweep, and Australia have lost their third wicket in ten balls! Stoinis drops to one knee, attempts to pick the gap, but merely picks out gully instead! A disappointing debut ends. With the bat at least ..."
252,"Ali to Hastings, no run cautiously onto the back foot, defended with a considered view of bat on ball"
253,"Ali to Hastings, no run weight forward this time but same result. And that's Moeen done for the day. 10 overs, 2 for 40. Excellent work"
254,"Plunkett to Wade, no run wide outside off, Wade tries to reach but can't connect"
255,"Plunkett to Wade, 1 run clunked into the covers and a slight misfield allows the single"
256,"Plunkett to Hastings, 1 wide too wide this time and called as such"
257,"Plunkett to Hastings, no run forward and defended"
258,"Plunkett to Hastings, no run waits in the crease, nudges a single out to point"
259,"Plunkett to Hastings, no run pushed onto the back foot, defended into the crease. Good heat on that delivery, as they like to say"
260,"Plunkett to Hastings, no run another splice-rattler. Excellent straight line of attack from Plunkett and England are turning the screw for the moment."
261,"Wood to Wade, no run driven outside off stump, but an inside-edge bobbles back into the crease"
262,"Wood to Wade, 1 run full and straight, driven down the ground for one more run"
263,"Wood to Hastings, no run short and lifting into the gloves, turned off the toes"
264,"Wood to Hastings, FOUR runs better from Hastings, a bit of width and leathered through the covers with a good stride and a firm slap. Shot"
265,"Wood to Hastings, no run tucked into the leg-side. Tighter line"
266,"Wood to Hastings, no run attempted yorker. In fact, you might even call it a well-executed yorker. Either way, it was very full, suitably dug out, and no run"
267,"Willey to Hastings, 1 run Willey, round the wicket, walloped out to midwicket. Low full toss"
268,"Willey to Wade, 1 run lovely bowling, back over the wicket, a yorker tailing in late. Nothing Wade can do but chop it onto his boot and sprint"
269,"Willey to Hastings, SIX runs smack-tastic! Another brutal swing of the bat, clean through the line as Willey misses his mark and Hastings indulges in a spot of range-hitting"
270,"Willey to Hastings, 1 run full toss, on the pads, Hales at deep square leg shows good hands to save the boundary and whistle in a quick return"
271,"Willey to Wade, 2 runs clipped off the toes, out to backward square leg"
272,"Willey to Wade, 1 run Wade keeps the strike, which England might not mind too much in the circumstances"
273,"Wood to Wade, 2 runs low full toss, clipped out to midwicket"
274,"Wood to Wade, FOUR runs remarkable stroke from Wade. Stepped out to the off side, Wood followed him, Wade got in a tangle with his ramp shot, but four is the upshot as he flicks the ball off his visor over the keeper's head"
275,"Wood to Wade, no run a loud cheer from the crowd but it's off the pad into the keeper's gloves"
276,"Wood to Wade, SIX runs blatted over midwicket as Wade picked Wood's slower ball. So much for Hastings being off-strike, this will do nicely for Australia"
277,"Wood to Wade, 1 run punched into the covers"
278,"Wood to Hastings, no run pushed onto the back foot, defended back down the track. Vital late impetus here for Australia"
279,"Plunkett to Wade, 1 run short and slapped out to midwicket"
280,"Plunkett to Hastings, FOUR runs blam! That's how Hastings operates, a fraction too short, and slammed over midwicket"
281,"Plunkett to Hastings, 1 run driven into the covers"
282,"Plunkett to Wade, 1 run full length, swatted out to deep midwicket"
283,"Plunkett to Hastings, FOUR runs full toss, waist high, carelessly loose, and that has given Hastings full licence to play baseball. Home run through wide long-on"
284,"Plunkett to Hastings, 1 run another attempted yorker, goes awry but not expensively so this time."
285,"Wood to Hastings, no run outside off, seaming past the edge, a Test-match delivery, met with a one-day waft. Which is an elaborate way of saying no run, through to the keeper"
286,"Wood to Hastings, SIX runs bosh. Levers. Front leg retreats to square leg, bat swings through. Get some of that"
287,"Wood to Hastings, 1 run blam! Hastings takes on his Durham team-mate again, and nearly skulls him in his follow-through. Half a thought of attempting a return catch. But then the other half of Wood's brain recognised discretion was better part of valour"
288,"Wood to Wade, 1 run loose from Wood, a glove-high full toss, and Wade is aghast it is not called a no-ball. That was an off-line beamer, to all intents and purposes"
289,"Wood to Hastings, 1 run driven out to the covers. More conventional length, and stroke"
290,"Wood to Wade, 2 runs firmly struck out to deep midwicket"
291,"Willey to Wade, FOUR runs turns inside out and flicks a sweep past his leg stump. Sweetly played"
292,"Willey to Wade, 1 run thumped hard, but the field is well set as long-off tidies up"
293,"Willey to Hastings, 1 run smashed out to deep midwicket, a bit of a predictable length from Willey there, but the sweeper is in position"
294,"Willey to Wade, FOUR runs up and under, a one-bounce four inches inside the rope at midwicket. Wade got right underneath that, almost a slog sweep"
295,"Willey to Wade, 1 run low full toss, but effective in the circumstances. Drilled out to deep midwicket"
296,"Willey to Hastings, 1 run Hastings' turn to keep the strike as Australia enter the final over with dreams of 300 back in their mind's eye"
297,"Wood to Hastings, 1 run clumped out to mid-on"
298,"Wood to Wade, SIX runs Wade unfurls the scoop shot again and that is stunningly timed, high over the keeper's head, straight out of the meat of the middle. Remarkable"
299,"Wood to Wade, 2 runs crashed into the gap at long-on, they scamper back for two"
300,"Wood to Wade, SIX runs massive! A pre-meditated move to the off-side and a violent wallop across the line as Wood pays the price for dropping too short. Gosh"
301,"Wood to Wade, 1 run thumped down the ground for a single. Wade's final ball of the innings completes his fifty from 26 balls"
302,"Wood to Hastings, 1 run swung hard and loose out to extra cover. That is a fantastic finale - 65 runs from the last five overs and England have a battle (of Hastings, clearly) on their hands to stay in the series."
303,"Right, time for a sarnie. Back in a bit!"
304,"Welcome back, Pattinson has the ball. The game is afoot"
305,"Pattinson to Roy, no run outside off stump, left well alone"

307,"Pattinson to Roy, no run on the pads, flicked fine but can't beat the field"
308,"Pattinson to Roy, 1 wide down the leg side, that one is called"
309,"Pattinson to Roy, no run down the track and driven back to the bowler"
310,"Pattinson to Roy, no run shorter, and Roy is cut in half as one nips back off the seam"
311,"Pattinson to Roy, no run a tidy finish to a tidy over. A punch of the gloves as Hales prepares to take strike at the other end"
312,"Cummins to Hales, no run full length, gently dug out of the blockhole"
313,"Cummins to Taylor, no run full and straight again. Cummins is majoring on speed x accuracy"
314,"Cummins to Taylor, no run slightly shorter and spliced into the covers"
315,"Cummins to Taylor, no run another massive appeal! Dharmasena says this one is sliding down, and Australia reluctantly agree. Sheer pace from Cummins and England at the moment have no answers"
316,"Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs now that's an answer! On the pads and sweetly timed, a clipped drive from Taylor whistles to the rope. Shot"
317,"Pattinson to Roy, 1 run flicked away fine, slight misdirection from Pattinson"
318,"Pattinson to Taylor, no run swift from both ends as Taylor defends"
319,"Pattinson to Taylor, no run whistles past the edge into the keeper's gloves. Sharp"
320,"Pattinson to Taylor, 1 leg bye on the pads, very full, and England accept the extra as square leg tidies up"
321,"Pattinson to Roy, no run tighter line, no way through as Roy beds in"
322,"Pattinson to Roy, no run a swish outside off, the ball dies a touch through to the keeper. Slim pickings for England so far"
323,"Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs compact and superb. Taylor's second four and both have been immaculate. Driven hard and flat through the gap in the covers"
324,"Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs width, and Taylor chases it hard, a flash outside off but his timing is impeccable as he meets it on the top of the bounce and crunches it past point"
325,"Cummins to Taylor, 1 wide over-compensation as Cummins spears this down the leg side"
326,"Cummins to Taylor, 1 run full length, driven on the up to midwicket. Taylor keen to put bat on ball and doing it effectively so far"
327,"Cummins to Roy, FOUR runs fantastic strike as Roy joins the counterattack. A hint of width and walloped through the covers"
328,"Cummins to Roy, no run times the pants off a flick through midwicket, but unluckily picks out the man at short midwicket. Never mind, next time ..."
329,"Cummins to Roy, no run full and hinting to swing back in. Driven calmly to mid-off. An eventful over"
330,"Pattinson to Taylor, FOUR runs a leg-stump half-volley and Taylor isn't going to squander those. For all the speed (and no, afraid I can't see the speedgun on this telly, sorry) there have been some loose deliveries at both ends"
331,"Pattinson to Taylor, (no ball) oversteps now. Free hit coming up"
332,"Pattinson to Taylor, no run good riposte, right in the blockhole. Toe-ended down the track. Well bowled in the circumstances"

334,"Pattinson to Taylor, no run outside off, at 89mph, through to the keeper"
335,"Pattinson to Taylor, FOUR runs crunched! Short and wide, a rank delivery at any pace, and Taylor uses every inch of his height to climb into the shot and punch a hole in the covers"
336,"Pattinson to Taylor, FOUR runs same ball, same shot, same result, with the added crowd bonus of a misfield at point. A pretty grim over, but England capitalised well on the offerings"
337,"Hastings to Roy, no run down to 81mph, a veritable sighter"
338,"Hastings to Roy, 1 run slashed down to third man as Roy climbs into the width on offer"
339,"Hastings to Taylor, 1 run fuller and straighter"
340,"Hastings to Roy, no run tighter line and length"
341,"Hastings to Roy, FOUR runs utterly belted through the covers - full length but too much width and Roy was all over that like the proverbial"
342,"Hastings to Roy, FOUR runs spawny, but effective! Full again, a loose drive, a thick inside-edge, and leg stump is jolly lucky to still be standing ..."
343,"Pattinson to Taylor, 1 run slightly early on the drive as this one bobbles off the splice into the leg side, but there's no-one on hand to catch it. Taylor's eagerness to attack nearly his undoing"
344,"Pattinson to Roy, 1 run width, and fenced down to third man"
345,"Pattinson to Taylor, 1 run flicked down to fine leg"
346,"Pattinson to Roy, no run driven on the up"

348,"Pattinson to Taylor, no run outside off, and pushed out to point."
349,"Hastings to Roy, FOUR runs sumptuous straight drive as Hastings over-pitches. The fifty is up and England are motoring"

354,"Hastings to Taylor, no run driven to mid-off with one hand leaving the bat for good effect"
355,"Pattinson to Roy, no run outside off and nearly a chop-on as Roy fences with feet stuck in concrete. But he survives"
356,"Pattinson to Roy, FOUR runs get some of that! The latter-day flamingo shot from one of KP's Surrey acolytes. And it's a one-bounce four over long-on. Bosh"
357,"Pattinson to Roy, 1 run steered down to third man"
358,"Pattinson to Taylor, 1 run flicked through the gap at midwicket"
359,"Pattinson to Roy, FOUR runs smashing strokeplay! A big stride, a powerful drive, an unstoppable four through the covers. He is seeing it like ... the proverbial a planet"
360,"Pattinson to Roy, 1 run one more to the total as England continue to bite chunks out of their requirement. It's an easy game when you're on top"
361,"Hastings to Roy, FOUR runs up and over! Roy meets a full length with a full face, straight back over the bowler's head. Top tonking"
362,"Hastings to Roy, no run wider on the crease, attacking the stumps, defended. Respect"
363,"Hastings to Roy, 1 run slower and wider, swished down to third man like a fly-fisherman on the Trent"
364,"Hastings to Taylor, no run fuller and straighter. Defended"
365,"Hastings to Taylor, no run a massive appeal for caught behind but the umpire is unmoved. And so too, after a long consultation, are the Aussies. Might have been thigh pad. Indeed it was"
366,"Hastings to Taylor, FOUR runs like Asterix on his magic potion, the little man packs a punch! This one nearly chins Hastings in his followthrough like an uppercut, not dissimilar to the one administered to Gluteus Maximus in Olympic Games"
367,"Cummins to Morgan, no run banged in short, and called as one for the over, but not an outright wide"
368,"Cummins to Morgan, 1 run on the hip, fenced past short leg, Morgan is off the mark"

370,"Cummins to Taylor, no run fully into line and defended back down the track"
371,"Cummins to Taylor, 1 run tucked off the toes, and another one to the total"
372,"Hastings to Taylor, no run"
373,"Hastings to Taylor, 1 run slapped hard into the covers, and a fumble gifts England another single"
374,"Hastings to Morgan, 2 runs sweetly timed, 87mph delivery, and escorted out towards the rope by a convoy of Australian fielders. A presidential stroke."
375,"Hastings to Morgan, no run full and straight, compact defence"
376,"Hastings to Morgan, 1 run chopped through backward point, Australia's line and length hasn't been all that. Except when it has, obviously, as Hales can attest"

378,"Cummins to Morgan, no run short of a length, Morgan hops into line"

386,"Marsh to Morgan, 1 run flashed out to deep cover"
387,"Marsh to Taylor, no run good restrictive areas from Marsh"
388,"Marsh to Taylor, FOUR runs ... but that's a fine response from Taylor, who latches onto a fractionally overpitched delivery and punches a drive straight past the bowler"
389,"Marsh to Taylor, 2 runs tucked off the toes, a better end to the over from England and Taylor"
390,"Cummins to Morgan, no run pounded in short, one for the over. But again, not called wide"
391,"Cummins to Morgan, no run"
392,"Cummins to Morgan, 1 run too much width, slashed in the air through the vacant cordon down to third man. All very deliberate"
393,"Cummins to Taylor, no run a hint of an appeal but that missed everything as it zipped through to the keeper"
394,"Cummins to Taylor, no run ambitious flat-footed slash, albeit it with both feet off the ground, half an enquiry for caught behind"
395,"Cummins to Taylor, no run hops into line outside off. Another over ticks by"

397,"Marsh to Morgan, 1 run a sweetly timed drive, only just intercepted at full stretch by a diving mid-off"
398,"Marsh to Taylor, no run punched back down the track"
399,"Marsh to Stokes, 2 runs off the mark straight away, with a clip through midwicket"

403,"Cummins to Morgan, 2 runs chopped down to third man, a touch of width to work with"

408,"Marsh to Stokes, no run lovely strike but straight to cover"
409,"Marsh to Stokes, 3 runs clipped off the toes at a sedate 82mph. Out to deep midwicket"
410,"Marsh to Morgan, no run slashed hard outside off stump and so nearly a chop-on. Wade does well to cut off the runs with a swallow dive behind the stumps"
411,"Marsh to Morgan, no run tighter line, tighter shot"
412,"Marsh to Morgan, FOUR runs too much width and Morgan improvises to make the most of it. He ended up deliberately toe-ending it out of the reach of the men lurking in the gully. They all count"

424,"Marsh to Morgan, no run crunched out to mid-off, nearly carried all the way to the fielder, who intercepted with a tumble"
425,"Marsh to Morgan, 1 run a firm swish but the field is well set, lots of cover on the off side to limit the impact"
426,"Marsh to Stokes, no run full length, poked out to point."
427,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run round the wicket, tossed up outside off, tapped towards point"

440,"Maxwell to Morgan, 2 runs Stokes attempts to take the attack to Maxwell and scoops the ball over the leg side, doesn't really get hold of it but lands safely in a gap"
441,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run tossed up and tapped back to the bowler"
442,"Maxwell to Morgan, SIX runs now Morgan goes after him and sends this into orbit...! That will come down with snow on it somewhere deep in the western terrace"
443,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 wide angled down the leg side behind Morgan's leg"
444,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run tossed up and pushed gently into the covers"
445,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run floated on off stump, pushed into the covers"
446,"Maxwell to Morgan, FOUR runs lovely stroke, gets the front foot to the pitch and squires a drive through the covers, gives the man in the deep the burn and that's four more"

452,"Stoinis to Stokes, no run shortish outside off, Stokes flashes at it and misses... or does he? Well, Stoinis thinks he nicked it, Dharmasena seems to be asking his partner whether it carried... Looks like Australia have asked for a review anyway. Well, there's a faint sound as the ball passes t"
453,"Pattinson to Morgan, 1 run short ball, at the body and Morgan hoicks it in ungainly fashion out towards deep square leg"
454,"Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs extra bounce for Patto and Stokes is squared up, thick-edges down to third man... Well wide of slip, had there been one in"

456,"Pattinson to Stokes, 1 wide slides down the leg side as Stokes tries to glance unsuccessfully"
457,"Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs short at the body, maybe rolled his fingers over it... Stokes certainly rolled his wrists and sends the ball fine for a more genuine boundary"
458,"Pattinson to Stokes, no run comes forward to tap a length ball into the covers"
459,"Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs lummy, that's a cracking shot, steps out to on drive on the up, clean through the line and it zips between mid-on and mid-off and away to the fence. Sublime"

472,"Stoinis to Stokes, 1 run short ball, taking the pace off, Stokes pulls through backward sqaure"
473,"Stoinis to Morgan, FOUR runs half-tracker from Stoinis, possibly out the back of the hand and Morgan bludgeons it down the ground, through the shot a little early but it span away from mid-on and off to the rope"

548,"Cummins to Morgan, OUT pitched up and sliced to backward point WHERE MAXWELL GRABS A SCREAMER!

580,"Pattinson to Ali, no run width, Ali chases it and inside-edges to midwicket. Another excellent over for England"
581,"Cummins to Plunkett, OUT wow, was that actually a clean catch? It's becoming commonplace these days, to take the ball above the head, on the rope, stagger back, lob the ball back into play, leap back over the rope, snaffle the rebound in mid-air and land as if nothing has happened. But Glenn Ma"
582,"Cummins to Ali, no run pushed back into the crease, Ali defends. England need to be a little careful now ..."

591,"Maxwell to Ali, 1 run tossed up, punched into the gap at cover, the requirement is down to 8"

595,"Pattinson to Ali, no run no way through this time"

601,"So, that is that. Tune in on Sunday for what promises to be a thrilling finale, in which England have the unexpected chance to seal victory over Australia in all three formats this summer. All the more reason for their arch-rivals to rally themselves and deny them."
602,"""it's a final now, both teams have to turn up and play and we'll be up for the channels. We'll have to play their spinners better. The boys have to pick themselves up and make sure they are ready to go."""
603,"""it did a little bit this morning, similar to Lord's, we've just got to be a little more watchful and make sure we have wickets in the shed for the late onslaught."""
604,"So, Australia paid the price for resting the tiring Mitchell Starc. Pat Cummins' at-times-fearsome pace earned him four wickets but the support cast was lacking today. Eoin Morgan, as fresh as a daisy after his recent break with Middlesex, top-scored for England with 92 and everyone after Alex Hales a"
605,"So, from 0-2 to 2-2 in the time it takes to cross the Pennines. England and Australia reconvene at Old Trafford on Sunday for a very tasty decider."
