14,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run back of a length slower ball, heaved away but straight to the fielder at short midwicket.

72,"Nortje to Warner, OUT gets his man this time! Great catch by Miller running back from short midwicket! Bouncer, pushed across the left-hander, and Warner was late on the pull.

80,"Pretorius to Wade, no run slower ball, very nearly played on, and then not far away from a calamitous run-out! Length on leg stump, looked to slog through midwicket, struck on the back of the bat, it dribbled to de Kock... Wade set off looking for a run, was sent back, and was scrambling back into his crease as QdK tried to kick the stumps down but dragged it wide! Drama!"

82,"Ngidi to Marsh, 1 run back of a length, dragged down the ground to long-on, only one"
83,"Ngidi to Wade, OUT length ball, pushed across him, skied miles up into the air towards short fine leg... de Kock runs round, gets underneath it, it comes down with snow on it, and de Kock dives forward to take the catch on the edge of the ring!

85,"Ngidi to Marsh, no run slower ball, guided to short point on the back foot"

100,"Ngidi to Carey, 1 run full on off stump, pushed across the left-handed Carey and whipped down the ground to long-on"
101,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run length outside off, Smith flays his bat at it looking to cut but only finds van Biljon at point on the bounce"
102,"Shamsi to Finch, 1 leg bye flat, down the leg side, skews out to square leg via de Kock's gloves. Given as a leg-bye, must have flicked the pad on the way through"

104,"Shamsi to Wade, 1 run rocks back and carves this out to wide long-off"
105,"Shamsi to Finch, OUT Finch gets down and across looking to lap this over short fine leg, but Shamsi sees him coming. He's struck on the inner thigh, down on one knee, Shamsi belts out an appeal and it's given! Looked pretty adjacent, and Finch trudges off after an imperious 55.

106,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run full and straight, driven out to long-off with soft hands"

114,"Rabada to Smith, (no ball) bowled 'im! 79mph/127kph, full and straight... hang on a minute, has he overstepped? Yes he has! Nightmare for Rabada, timber went flying as Smith got across to the off side and couldn't get bat on a slower yorker which burst through his legs!"

117,"Rabada to Carey, 2 runs low full toss, short-arm jabbed out to midwicket, Nortje is running in off the fence but shells the chance! Never looked comfortable under the high ball, similar chance to the one Lockie Ferguson took in the World Cup final - difficult, but gettable"
118,"Rabada to Carey, OUT timber this time! Offcutter on a length, Carey clears the front leg, is through the shot early, and it pings back the top of middle! No overstep this time, much to Rabada's relief"

122,"Nortje to Smith, 2 runs slower ball, flies miles up into the air but into no-man's-land... there's a man diving underneath it, but he can't hold on! Looks like it was Klaasen running in from deep midwicket, burst through his hands as he dived forwards"
123,"Nortje to Smith, 2 runs shifts across to scoop, doesn't get all of it, and fine leg catches up with it"
124,"Nortje to Smith, SIX runs full extension of the arms, inside-out over extra cover for six! Extraordinary batting, high front elbow, zero foot movement other than to rock onto the back foot, and timed into the stands!"
125,"Nortje to Smith, 2 runs slower yorker on the stumps, clipped out to midwicket for a couple"
126,"Nortje to Smith, 2 runs slower ball on a length outside off, pulled hard to deep midwicket and they race back for a second"
127,20 runs off the final over!
128,"7.39pm: Australia post 193 for 5 - not as high as it could have been after a lightning-fast start thanks to Finch and Warner's rapid-fire fifties, but a useful total nonetheless, with the pitch getting slower and Australia picking two spinners in Agar and Zampa. Australia's middle order got in a muddle again, with Wade and Marsh both struggling for timing after their promotions, but Smith was quite outrageous at the death,"
129,"""Nortje over Steyn might cost SA the match,"" mutters Mudhabir."
130,"7.43pm: More high-octane stuff... some thrilling T20Is in South Africa in the past couple of weeks, first the nail-biting England series and now this.

147,"Starc to du Plessis, OUT reaching for the slash over third man, and Zampa clings onto a blinder! Another huge breakthrough, full length, wide line, Faf was nowhere near the ball but had a go anyway, his spiralling outside edge almost had enough toe-end on it to reach the rope, but Zampa somehow located the ball in the wind, and clung on with both hands, flinging himself backwards"
148,"Starc to Klaasen, 1 wide lifting down the leg side, Carey can't gather cleanly"
149,"Starc to Klaasen, no run zipping past the outside edge on a tighter line, well bowled, and well beaten. Australia look in the mood to dominate"

172,"Agar to van der Dussen, 1 run stabbed to short third man, the rate continues to creep up"

185,"Zampa to Miller, 2 runs compact sweep, out to deep square, and good running to get back for the second"

204,"Cummins to Pretorius, 1 wide banged in short, Pretorius pokes at it with a vertical bat, like a slightly off-balanced gun on a partridge shoot. And misses"
205,"Cummins to Pretorius, 1 wide slower ball, off line, maybe South Africa can do it in extras?"
206,"Cummins to Pretorius, 1 run cracked out to the off side"
207,"Cummins to Rabada, no run back of a length, slower ball, cautiously pointed towards point"
208,"Marsh to Nortje, no run worked to the on side, nothing doing there"
209,"Marsh to Nortje, 1 run slower ball, back of a length, flapped to deep cover"
210,"Marsh to Rabada, 1 run opens the face, nurdled to third man. A direct hit would have been out!"
211,"Marsh to Nortje, no run stand-and-deliver. A flat-footed swipe to a lifting ball outside off, finds thin air"
212,"Marsh to Nortje, 1 run slower ball, tight to off stump, worked with stiff wrists to midwicket"
213,"Agar to Nortje, no run pressed out to point"
214,"Agar to Shamsi, no run cripes, that's close! A quicker ball, zeroing in on the top of off, and fenced away with a frantic inside-edge!"
215,"Agar to Shamsi, no run swished to point off the back foot"
216,"Agar to Shamsi, 1 run on the toes, clipped hard to the leg side, to ironic cheers"
217,"Starc to Shamsi, 1 run fired into the legs, and pops behind square for another single"
218,"Starc to Rabada, FOUR runs whoops, that's a freebie to any quality of batsman, a half-volley on the toes, and chipped sweetly through fine leg"
219,"9.12pm So, make of that what you will. A 107-run defeat at Joburg, a 97-run defeat today. And somewhere, sandwiched between the two, South Africa eked out a 12-run win at Port Elizabeth. It's been a grim display from the hosts this evening, who have now been beaten in three of their four series this summer, despite a win in each of those, and despite taking each of the last three to a decider."
220,"9.15pm Handshakes all round out in the middle. The teams will be back in action in the ODIs next week, but South Africa will need something special to lift them from that."
221,"9.30pm So, that will do for tonight. Formidable from Australia, they really have built themselves quite the machine ahead of a home T20 World Cup. From Matt and myself, and Firdose (whose report will be right here), goodnight!"
222,Australia won by 97 runs
223,"Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS"
