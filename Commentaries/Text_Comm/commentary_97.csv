0,"1.20pm: We've have a toss! And Australia have won it and will bowl, they are going to try and chase again. Travis Head returns to the top of the order, in Finch's absence, while Mitchell Starc is rested and Andrew Tye gets another crack. Just one change for England, with Tom Curran replacing the injured Liam Plunkett."

27,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, OUT pitched up, finds the outside edge - another one goes! England are tottering like aunty on the gin... Hazlewood went wide on the crease and slid the ball in, enticing the drive but there was just enough seam movement to shift the line and kiss the edge of the bat. Bairstow slopes off in the fifth"

253,"Cummins to Woakes, no run Woakes hops into line and leaves alone once more"
254,"Cummins to Woakes, no run teasing line, draws the fretful prod, takes the edge - but doesn't carry to slip! So close for Cummins, who ends with an immaculate 4 for 24 from his 10, a metre or two short of getting his fifth with the final ball of the spell"

270,"Tye to Tom Curran, OUT gone! Tye finishes it with the knuckle-ball, ending Curran's sally with a mistimed chip to midwicket. A cheeky thirty at a run a ball helping England to respectability, but almost certainly not enough"
