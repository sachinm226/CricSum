1,"Agar to Guptill, 1 run full at off stump, driven along the floor to long-off"
2,"Agar to Phillips, no run good length and into middle stump, deep in the crease to pat it down the pitch"
3,"Agar to Phillips, no run full and just outisde off, mistimed drive to extra cover"
4,"Agar to Phillips, no run length and into middle stump, hurriedly pushed towards mid-on off the back foot"
5,"Agar to Phillips, no run short of a length and turning away from off, pushed into the off side off the back foot"
6,"Agar to Phillips, FOUR runs swatted over mid-on! Full and into leg stump, uses the angle to get his hands through this and lift it over the infield"
7,"Meredith to Guptill, 1 run short of a length and just outisde off, 147kph. Hangs leg side of that and steers to third man"
8,"Meredith to Phillips, no run catches him on his right thigh. Short of a length and skidding rapidly on, 148kph, as he shapes to pull. It was too full and he was cramped"
9,"Meredith to Phillips, FOUR runs drilled past the bowler's head! Length ball at 147kph, clears the front leg and gives that a big punch. Meredith has to go to floor to avoid that in his follow through"
10,"Meredith to Phillips, no run short of a length outisde off, mistimed pull to mid-on"
11,"Meredith to Phillips, FOUR runs pulled in front of square. Short and sitting up at hip height. Stays put in the crease and slaps it on the rise"
12,"Meredith to Phillips, FOUR runs creamed through the covers. No one on the rope there. It's overpitched at the stumps, his front leg is in the leg side to create swinging room and he connects sweetly"

17,"Jhye Richardson to Chapman, no run short of a length and across the corridor, looks for the pull and is beaten"
18,"Zampa to Phillips, SIX runs slog swept over wide long-on! Length ball dipping outside off. Might have been a googly. Makes no difference once Phillips is down on his knee and gets a clean swing at this"
19,"Zampa to Phillips, no run length and pushed through flat at leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
20,"Zampa to Phillips, SIX runs clubbed over long-on for the series win! Lovely little cameo from Phillips here, came out looking to hit boundaries and nailed it. This is tossed up and once again he clears the front leg to make room and goes against the turn with a lofted drive"
21,"2:59pm Hugs and handshakes all around as New Zealand overcome the hiccups in their last two games to take this series convincingly. The bowling delivered as a whole today for them, Ish Sodhi once again among the wickets and doing most of the damage. Economical stuff from the rest of the bowlers too before the brand new opening stand of Guptill and Conway delivered. They had impetus at the start, which turned into confident stroke-making and eventually into a"
