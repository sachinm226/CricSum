0,"Hosein to Carey, 1 wide good length ball grips and turns sharply from middle down the leg side, wide called."
1,"Hosein to Carey, 2 wide another good length ball on middle rips down the leg side past a forward prod, beats Hope this time behind the stumps and they run one in addition to the extra."
2,"Hosein to Henriques, no run good length ball on fourth stump, prods forward to defend."
3,"Hosein to Henriques, 1 run good length ball on fifth stump, goes after the width and slaps this through point."
4,"Hosein to Carey, no run full on off, sweeps this straight to short fine leg."
5,"Hosein to Carey, no run good length ball on fourth stump, awkward sweep short picks out fine leg again, lucky it wasn't a top edge. Nowhere near sweeping length."
6,"Hosein to Carey, OUT Carey looked uncomfortable all over long to Hosein and finally comes undone! Hosein tosses this up with more flight full on fifth stump to encourage a drive against the turn to mid-off, but he's been getting sharp turn all over and Carey doesn't get to the pitch. Unsurprisingly he pays the price as the ball rips past the inside edge of the attempted drive, through the gate and crashes into middle stum"
7,"Hosein to Turner, no run short on sixth stump, it sticks in the pitch and turns, Turner slightly ahead of the shot slapping this uppishly but into a gap between backward point and cover before it is fielded."
8,"Walsh to Henriques, no run good length ball on fourth stump, defended."
9,"Walsh to Henriques, no run flighted full on middle and off at 79 kph, smothered on the front foot."
10,"Walsh to Henriques, 1 run short on leg stump, Henriques pulls flat to deep backward square for one."
11,"Walsh to Turner, 1 run low full toss on middle, chipped uppishly toward Pollard at short midwicket, he's slow diving to his left and it goes underneath his outstretched arms through to deep midwicket for one."
12,"Walsh to Henriques, 1 run full on the stumps, defended on the front foot again."
13,"Walsh to Turner, no run googly on fourth stump, Turner goes back to defend, inside edges this in between his legs and caroms off the left leg through to Hope, very lucky to have missed leg stump."
14,"Hosein to Henriques, no run short and wide, slaps this to cover, Jason Mohammed on the ring."
15,"Hosein to Henriques, OUT edge to slip! Hosein once again slows it down and flights it more getting the just rewards. This one is on sixth stump on a full length, Henriques gropes at this well away from his body in awkward fashion with a cross bat swipe and the extra bounce plus sharp turn has it fly off a thick edge to Holder at rib height moving to his right at slip."
16,"Hosein to Wade, 1 leg bye good length ball on the legs, spins down the leg side off the pads and given as a leg bye."
17,"Hosein to Turner, OUT Hosein is ripping through this entire order with the sharp turn on offer! He was bowling his first handful of deliveries in the 90-94 kph range but slows this up at 86 kph and once more is rewarded. Turner gropes forward at this good length ball on leg stump and it rips past the outside edge to clatter the top of off!"

23,"Walsh to Starc, 1 run full toss on the hips, flicked to deep backward square."
24,"Walsh to Wade, no run flighted on a good length on off stump, Wade goes to play a paddle sweep and there looks like a deflection. He's overstretching badly and Hope appeals for a stumping but really it looked like he gloved it. Given not out. They appeal for DRS! I think this may be overturned. They look at the stumping appeal first and Wade just has his toe behind the line. On reflection it may have passed his glove and"

44,"Hosein to Starc, no run pushes forward well away from his body, grips and takes a thick inside edge"

150,"Mohammed to Zampa, 1 run full on middle and leg, flicked through midwicket for one."

Full in the slot on sixth stump at 133 kph, a hit me ball and Wade does so but fails to elevate this in his effort to shovel it over the ring.

179,"Joseph to Agar, no run back of a length ball on the stumps, defended on the back foot."
180,"Joseph to Agar, 1 run back of a length wider on fifth stump at 129 kph, Agar guides this with an open face to deep third man."

193,"Joseph to Agar, FOUR runs very very poor from Cottrell at mid-off. Full ball on middle, punched firmly to Cottrell, he attacks it from mid-off trying to deny what would've been a comfortable single and a matador red cape effort bending very tamely to try to pick it up turns the ball into a boundary."

217,"Walsh to Agar, 1 run flighted full on sixth stump, drive to Cottrell at wide long-off for one."
218,"Walsh to Zampa, FOUR runs reverse sweep! And connects beautifully! Premeditated this to a full ball on middle, cracks it off the meat of thebat and sends it wide of backward point to the rope. That was a shot of a top-class batsman."
219,"Walsh to Zampa, no run short and wide, slapped to extra cover on the ring."
220,"Holder to Agar, FOUR runs attempted yorker winds up as an overpitched delivery on leg stump, Agar backs away and smashes a drive through mid-off to the rope."

231,"Cottrell to Zampa, OUT yorker finally cleans up Zampa. Full on the stumps at 130 kph, Zampa backs away to heave over cover and misses, off stump is uprooted. Cottrell gives a very tame and frustrated salute, almost in disgust that they've allowed this stand to last for as long as it has. Zampa has played an incredibly valuable hand and the West Indies know it."
232,"Joseph to Agar, OUT you wait all day for a bus and then two come at once! Joseph firest this in full and a yard outside leg stump following Agar backing way away from the stumps. Agar tries to flick over square leg but gets a leading edge that balloons over point. Lewis takes a catch backpedaling from the ring."
233,West Indies were in front for the majority of the innings but heading into the break it is Australia who look like favorites to come out of this match with 10 valuable points on the World Cup Super League points table because the West Indies are facing a tricky target on a crumbling wicket. Stay with us for the start of the chase in a bit.
234,"6.07 pm From 45 for 6, and on a pitch that was turning viciously, I don't think anyone could have foreseen such a resilient recovery. Hosein ends with 3 for 30, but that somehow feels incredibly unsatisfying and underwhelming considering the fact that he had figures of 3 for 5 after two overs at 45 for 6 on a pitch giving him all the assistance he could dream of. What a fightback by the Australia lower-order, including a pair of"

467,"Turner to Joseph, FOUR runs almighty heave ends the match in style! Joseph slams a full ball from fourth stump high and deep over midwicket bouncing into the rope. West Indies clinch a four-wicket win with 12 overs to spare. They claim 10 very significant points on the World Cup Qualifying Super League points table. The speed of the win too is significant as they'll get a healthy net run rate bump too."
468,"West Indies move past Ireland up into a tie with Pakistan for fifth place on the Super League points table at 40 points. Pakistan have played one more match than West Indies. Australia remain in third place on 50 points, 30 points behind Bangladesh who have played 12 matches to Australia's 8 games. Come back on Monday for the series finale between these two sides. That's all for now. For Andrew McGlashan, I'm Peter Della Penna."
469,"9.49 pm Solid chase by the hosts to claim 10 points in World Cup Qualifying on what was a very tricky wicket. Australia only have themselves to blame with some extremely sloppy fielding. Pooran was dropped twice, including the first time on 26 with the score 123 for 5 on a straightforward chance at mid-off into the lap of Moises Henriques. Pooran and Holder parlayed that extra life into a 93-run partnership and the pressure ease"
