231,"Lee to Dhoni, no run in the corridor line this time, but it's short, and the bouncer is swayed way away from, and pretty easily, too"
232,"Lee to Dhoni, no run maintains a good line, the ball plinking down the channel once more, on a good length and left alone"
233,"Lee to Dhoni, no run guess where he bowled it? Correct, and it took some swing away, Dhoni not tempted into flashing outside off"
234,"Johnson to Pathan, 1 run Pathan decides enough is enough and aims to squeeze a ball on off through midwicket"
235,"Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run but Dhoni is more confident, the ball shortish on middle, and he presses down off the hips for an easy clip-and-run"
236,"Johnson to Pathan, 3 runs and a better shot from Pathan too, taking one from off and working out in front of midwicket. Some good running from the batsmen, there"
237,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run stays over to the right hander, good length ball on off, defended forward"
238,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run slower delivery, 138.9kph, drops down in front of off, almost yorker length, and it's tidily defended"
239,"Lee to Pathan, FOUR runs over the wicket, overstretched with a half-volley that Pathan stands tall to meet, presenting the face of the bat and the ball races through mid-off"

241,"Lee to Pathan, no run strained across the left hander on a good length, wide enough to leave"
242,"Lee to Pathan, no run angles into the left hander now, pushed back forward on the front foot towards Lee who scoops it up"
243,"Lee to Pathan, no run banged in at the left hander, moving in off the seam and that was comfortably ducked under, on the knees"
244,"Lee to Pathan, no run similar ball, similar result, only this time Pathan practises his on-on- knee-and-sway manoeuvre. This is also effective"
245,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run oh hello, not much daylight offered on that one, right up there on off and forcing the defensive"
246,"Johnson to Dhoni, 2 runs half-volley on off, not quite timed, but they pick up something all the same from a front-foot push"
247,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run moved back in from the seam from outside off, cutting right back and rapping his bat above the sticks, the ball crashing back into his body"
248,"Johnson to Dhoni, FOUR runs a stand-and-deliver shot from Dhoni, literally, he took one step, stopped and then swung his arms away from his body through the covers. Belted"
249,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run Johnson responds well with a better-length delivery that rears up outside off, forcing Dhoni to shoulder arms once on his haunches"
250,"Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run outside off once more, Dhoni stands firm and tries to repeat a similar shot from two balls back, only straighter. He plays it a fraction late and the ball crashes off the toe of the bat into the floor and hardly goes anywhere"
251,"Lee to Dhoni, no run a little bit of movement away from the right hander outside off, he jumps back and shoulders arms"
252,"Lee to Dhoni, no run a slow, slower ball, at 113kph, the ball also dying, oddly, on its way through outside off"

254,"Lee to Dhoni, no run tight delivery outside off, a good length, and it's wisely left alone"
255,"Lee to Dhoni, no run short ball, rising over off, in other words a bouncer, swayed under, reverse-limbo-style"
256,"Lee to Dhoni, no run done him like a kipper, or a dressed lamb, anyway the ball nipped back in from outside off, on a good length, and though he shaped to leave it, it nearly brushed the outside edge"
257,"Johnson to Pathan, no run stays over, obviously enough as he's facing a left hander, up there on off, and snuffed out defensively on the front foot"
258,"Johnson to Pathan, no run hurried on to him down the same line, the ball jumping up and defended back down on the back foot"
259,"Johnson to Pathan, FOUR runs strays on to middle with the attempted yorker that's in fact a half-volley, Pathan waiting for the one which angled back in to him and flicked it in front of midwicket"
260,"Johnson to Pathan, FOUR runs overcorrects with a wide one, Pathan crashes out a cut through the gully that flies in the air but Superman Hussey can't stay airborne long enough as he dives to the left"

262,"Johnson to Pathan, 1 run turned well off the legs through fine leg to round off a useful over for India"
263,"Clark to Pathan, no run start-and-a-half from Clark who licks the ball away from the left hander, movement from both the seam and in the air, too good for the batsman who's saved by the drift away"
264,"Clark to Pathan, no run lets that one go through down off, more deliberate this time, the ball again nipping off the seam away"
265,"Clark to Pathan, 1 run overpitches this time, at 131.7kph on off, pushed out through the covers where there's some neat work with a forward dive to take the pace off the ball, if not quite a full stop"
266,"Clark to Dhoni, OUT pitches in line with off, there's a huge, long appeal and Umpire Rauf takes his time to give that one out. Dhoni gets in a big stride forward on a bouncy pitch, the ball hits him on the knee roll, the batsman not quite bending his knee on the forward defensive"
267,"Clark to Kumble, no run got him! Hasn't got him! Kumble comes on to his front foot and squirted out towards Jaques at short midwicket who dives forward but didn't catch it cleanly and immediately signals so"
268,"Clark to Kumble, no run a much less eventful ball to round off the over, defending forward in line with off"

274,"Johnson to Dhoni, no run short of a length outside off, angling away, 138ks, well left"
275,"Lee to Pathan, 2 runs ah thats tough! Lee bangs in a snorter, Pathan tries to get out of the way but bat hangs out in the air and the thick edge flies just over third slip"
276,"Lee to Pathan, no run short of a length outside off stump, he gets back and shoulders arms"
277,"Lee to Pathan, no run jaffa! A cracking bouncer has him sniffing leather, but he just does well to rear his head out of the way - what a delivery at the end of the day"
278,"Lee to Pathan, 2 runs fuller one now, swinging in, Pathan pushes wide of mid-on and wants two"
279,"Lee to Pathan, no run sharp one, nipping back off a short length, 146ks, and Pathan lunges forward then back to defend towards point"

281,"Johnson to Pathan, no run right up there and defended forward"
282,"Johnson to Pathan, 1 run presses forward to clip into midwicket on the front foot, the ball a regulation one on off"
283,"Johnson to Kumble, no run cracker from Johnson, evil movement in the air and pitches just outside off, nearly clipping the batsman's outside edge, a nervy one for Kumble"
284,"Johnson to Kumble, no run pushed a bit wider, fended away from the body on the front foot into the covers"
285,"Johnson to Kumble, 1 run a drop at gully, Clark diving to his left, as Kumble lashed a back-foot cut hard down from a wideish delivery"
286,"Johnson to Pathan, OUT another wicket, a full delivery, a dipping low toss rapping him on the front shin in front of leg, and a smiling Johnson roars his appeal, knowing what the answer will be"
287,"Clark to Kumble, OUT top catch from Rogers, diving full length to his right in the covers, as Kumble, repeating his lashing efforts for the previous over, drives on the up, his shoulders pointing upwards so he wasn't over the ball, and Rogers snaps it up with a classic catch"
288,"Clark to Sharma, no run he survives a huge appeal first up for a strangle down leg, Gilchrist diving well to his left, but it's turned down, rightly as it turns out, as the ball brushed hip only"
289,"Clark to Sharma, no run stands tall, defends down on the back foot just outside off"
290,"Clark to Sharma, no run Ishant takes a few positive steps forward towards point, but quickly turns defensive as Clark gives him a straight bouncer"
291,"Clark to Sharma, no run on off, shortish, Ishant fends into the covers"
292,"Clark to Sharma, no run a booming yorker on off, well dug out by Ishant"
293,"Johnson to Singh, no run Johnson misdirects a bouncer over leg, which is crouched under"
294,"Johnson to Singh, OUT Johnson wraps up the innings by flinging down a climbing delivery which rises and catches the top of RP Singh's blade, the ricochet pouched by Hussey who stands, nearly celebrates before the ball's reached him, and was never in a month of Sundays going to drop that one"
295,"India have quickly subsided following the loss of Dhoni which is a shame as they were looking good for 400 for a few brief moments earlier on today. Instead, they're gone for 330, the last four wickets adding a further 33 today. Johnson looked pretty dangerous from the off today, and Clark did well when he came on for a quick flirt. RP Singh races off"
296,"Right, it's Jaques and Rogers batting together for the first time, RP Singh to bowl."
297,"Singh to Jaques, 2 runs Jaques is away immediately, taking the ball from middle, letting it pitch, then pushing it easily through midwicket"
298,"Singh to Jaques, no run waits, and defends forward on the front foot"

301,"Singh to Jaques, no run on off, left alone a rising delivery shortish, on its way through"
302,"Singh to Jaques, no run oh, just past him, excellent delivery from Singh, pushing him on to the back foot, squaring him up outside off and just failing to take the edge"
303,"Pathan to Rogers, no run a thick edge to start with, the ball whirring away from him, and the ball squirting to the gully"
304,"Pathan to Rogers, no run lets the ball through the channel this time, the length too good to think about playing"

306,"Pathan to Rogers, no run comes forward and clips towards midwicket"
307,"Pathan to Rogers, no run lets this one through to the keeper, more lip-licking curl from Pathan"
308,"Pathan to Rogers, no run makes him play this time, the ball aiming towards off and with the familiar swing, Rogers defends sturdily on the front foot and he now has his first over of Test cricket under his belt."
309,"Singh to Jaques, no run right up there in front of off, defended forward solidly"

313,"Singh to Jaques, no run Singh bungs in a bouncer, testing the track, but it's easily left outside off"
314,"Singh to Jaques, FOUR runs width outside off, you can't bowl there to him etc, and he smashes an authoritative cut through point and on to the rope"
315,"Pathan to Rogers, FOUR runs width outside off, Rogers comes out of his crease, and nails a square drive through the covers"
316,"Pathan to Rogers, no run comes out to look to play the same shot, it's a touch fuller, so he leaves it"
317,"Pathan to Ponting, 1 run excellent whippy delivery, tight up there, and somehow Ponting manages to squeeze out to the leg side"
318,"Pathan to Hussey, no run more testing swing away from (yet another) left hander, but it's wide enough to leave"
319,"Singh to Ponting, 1 run swung on to leg, turned off the hips through fine leg"
320,"Singh to Hussey, no run outside off, swung well and rising through at head-height to Dhoni, 141kph"

331,"Singh to Hussey, no run three slips and a gully waiting for an edge that doesn't come from the drive into the covers"
332,"Singh to Clarke, FOUR runs a big appeal for lbw, but turned down as the ball pitches on middle and veers away from him late, Clarke pressing down a would-be forward defensive and the edge squirts wide of the slips"
