300,"Lee to Tremlett, no run Lee nearly finishes the innings with a pinpoint yorker, Tremlett does well to keep that out"
301,"Lee to Tremlett, no run the review system is being used for the first time in ODIs, Australia have asked for it after Shahzad is struck on the back pad outside leg and goes through to the keeper, Lee think there's an inside-edge and asks for a caught-behind, replays don't show a nick, there were two noises as the ball flicked the front pad before thudding into the back pad, Tremlett survives"

312,"There's not long before Australia's chase starts, but there is time to check out Andrew McGlashan's bulletin. Cricinfo also has a sparkly new travel site, which is a must-see if you're planning on going to the World Cup. We have"
313,I'm off to get some food. This is Siddarth Ravindran signing out. Liam Brickhill will be on hand in a bit to describe Australia's batting.
314,"So England finish on 294, perhaps they would have expected more after the start they got. The openers had plenty of lives but maintained a punishing rate; only KP made a big contribution after the openers departed though and England couldn't reach the 300 they seemed set to get. It was a wonderful innings from KP, controlled initially before bringing out the big hits against the spinners. The slow bowlers are expected to get some help in the second"
315,"Right, we're all set for the second half of this game. Shane Watson is marking his guard as England's fielders scatter across the MCG. Brad Haddin is up at the other end, and it'll be Tim Bresnan to open the bowling for England."
316,"Bresnan to Watson, no run nice and straight to start, good length too. Coming in gently off the seam, and Watson steps forward to defend to mid-on"
317,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is away! Too straight from Bresnan, slipping towards leg stump and Watson just had to get a touch on it - fine leg is very square"
318,"Bresnan to Watson, no run full again, but outside off this time and Watson aims a crunchy drive right at mid-off"
319,"Bresnan to Watson, no run cracked square on the drive this time, Morgan fields nicely on the bounce"
320,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs delicate late cut from Watson, but Yardy's fielding down at third man is just as good and saves two runs"
321,"Bresnan to Watson, no run shaping gently away through the air, Watson steps well forward and drives into the covers"
322,"Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run full and shaping away to start - this was quite wide and went even further. A thick outside edge bounces down to third man"
323,"Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs slap! Wide again, and short this time. Watson cashes in with a flashing cut that beats a diving point and also evades third man"
324,"Tremlett to Watson, no run that's better from Tremlett, he straightens his line and Watson stays deep in the crease to defend back down the track"
325,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Watto is looking to impose himself early here, lunging forward to drive hard into the covers. He finds the fielder, however"
326,"Tremlett to Watson, no run great length from Tremlett, drawing the batsman forward but extracting enough bounce to hit the splice as Watson defends to extra cover"
327,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run slightly wider of off, Watson steps forward and runs it off the face of the blade down to third man"
328,"Bresnan to Watson, no run flung down on a length, but outside off and easily left alone. Not a great deal of movement on offer for the quicks so far"
329,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs cracking drive! Watson is great to watch when he's in this sort of form, he strides confidently down the pitch and slams a technically perfect drive through the covers. Power and placement."

333,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run a thick inside edge thumps into the pad and rolls to leg, and Watson will keep the strike as they scamper through for one"

335,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett pulls the length back, Watson defends to cover with a hop"
336,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run properly short this time from the bowler, Watson rocks back and pulls out into the deep - but there's a man out there, Pietersen, to stop the boundary"

338,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Watson drops a back-of-a-length delivery close in on the off side and briefly considers a cheeky single, but the fielder is in too quickly"
339,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run nicely done, not a great deal of width to work with as the ball lands on a length on off stump, but Watson just stays on leg stump and glides it down to third man for one"
340,"Bresnan to Watson, no run tight, length delivery right on middle and off. Watson defends"
341,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is in top form here, hitting the ball just where he wants to. The slip fielder had just been moved - Strauss it was - and so Watson aims a delicate late cut right through that region, beating Pietersen at third man for a boundary"
342,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run hmm, and he follows that up with a much more awkward-looking chop down to that third man fielder. Still, gets the job done and that's a single"
343,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run well, the batsman steps away to leg and swings mightily at a length delivery outside off - hitting only fresh air. It was the cross-seamed delivery from Bresnan, and it gripped a touch on the wicket and moved away from the bat"
344,"Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run slower ball this time, but picked by Haddin who nudges into the leg side for one"
345,"Bresnan to Watson, no run Bresnan hones in on a good length, Watson defends"

348,"Tremlett to Haddin, 3 runs nice little shot from Haddin, as Tremlett slips too full and too straight and is worked out to deep midwicket"
349,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett lets one go with a grunt and finds a good length on off stump. Played down to gully. He's looking for third man with the shot"
350,"Tremlett to Watson, no run slower ball from Tremlett, Watson was early stepping forward but re-adjusted quickly and cracked the full delivery to point"
351,"Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs short, pulled hard out towards wide midwicket but Pietersen charges across and tumbles over to save the boundary. Great fielding. Good field placement for Watson too"
352,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run good start, hitting a length and moving in to the right-hander, who steps back and defends"
353,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin gives himself some room but Shahzad's rhythm isn't disturbed and he aims a length ball at the off stump. Tapped to cover"

359,"Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs lucky! Haddin backs away and aims an uncertain poke at a back-of-a-length delivery, a thick inside edge rolls wide of fine leg and that's four. Wasn't too far away from the stumps though"
360,"Tremlett to Haddin, no run for the third time Haddin steps to leg, this time drilling it hard to mid-off"
361,"Tremlett to Haddin, 1 leg bye back of a length, the ball comes off Haddin's hip and they nip through for a leg bye"
362,"Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs worked off the pad, behind square on the leg side and they're back for the second"

364,"Shahzad to Watson, no run good slower ball from Shahzad, but Watson spots it and defends"
365,"Shahzad to Watson, no run just outside off this time, again it's slower through the air, tapped to point. That was the legcutter, he just ran the fingers over the ball and got it to grip a touch"
366,"Shahzad to Watson, no run fuller and quicker, Watson aims a cautious drive straight to mid-on"
367,"Shahzad to Watson, 2 runs curving in through the air, but the ball starts too wide of off and Watson is able to punch out to deep point for a couple"
368,"Shahzad to Watson, no run slower again, much slower this time. For a moment it appeared as though Watson was going to have a heave at this, but he just held himself back and opted for defence instead"
369,"Shahzad to Watson, SIX runs this time he does have a go, and slams it in some style into the crowd behind long-on! It was another slower ball from Shahzad, but too full. That was a 101-metre six, quite a monster"
370,"Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run cramping the batsman for room, the ball is tapped into the leg side"
371,"Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs a top-edged pull, the ball swirls up, hanging in the air for an age ... and it's dropped by Trott, running back from mid-on! It was a really tough chance, he leapt back trying to take it over his shoulder but just got a hand to it and couldn't hold on"
372,"Tremlett to Watson, no run chopped down to gully"
373,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run swatted out into the deep on the leg side, an aggressive front-foot pull from the batsman"

375,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run whipped off the front pad and out into the leg side, and that's the first Powerplay done"
376,"Yardy to Watson, no run pushed to mid-off"
377,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run Yardy, coming round the wicket, fires one in at leg stump and is clipped to midwicket. Shahzad sprints across and does really well to prevent the second run"
378,"Yardy to Haddin, 1 run looped up much slower, full on leg stump, and Haddin drives down to long-on"
379,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run nudged just wide of midwicket, and that's fifty for Shane Watson. His team really need him to stick around and play through the innings"

418,"Yardy to Watson, no run tossed up on middle, a bit of inside edge and a bit of pad gets 'keeper and bowler interested, but there's no appeal"
419,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run driven down to long-off, there's the 100. This is also, incidentally, Haddin and Watson's best opening stand for Australia"
420,"Yardy to Haddin, 1 run Haddin comes down the track and drives to long-off"
421,"Yardy to Watson, no run slightly too wide, cut but straight to point"
422,"Yardy to Watson, no run a toe-ended drive rolls into the covers"
423,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run pushed just to the left of mid-on, there's a call for the run straight away and the sprint through"
424,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run full on off stump, dug out towards mid-off"
425,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run good shape away from the bat this time, that hasn't happened too often today. Possibly the legcutter once more, as the ball nips past the outside edge. As he has done all innings, Haddin had backed away to leg"
426,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter, defended to cover"
427,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run a checked drive this time, again the ball goes to extra cover on the bounce"
428,"Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs outside edge, genuine edge, and through the vacant slip region for four! Well wide of Davies, he had no chance"
429,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run testing over from Shahzad, this time he fires in a yorker outside off and the ball nips right under the bat as Haddin jabs down at it. Through to the 'keeper"
430,"Swann to Watson, no run short from Swann, Watson was back and waiting for the aggressive pull but the ball just skidded through low to beat the bottom edge and land in Davies' gloves"
431,"Swann to Watson, 1 run Watson stays back again and punches wide of mid-off this time"
432,"Swann to Haddin, 2 runs just a bit too short, nice shot from Haddin, delicately late-cut down to third man. Yardy chases the ball down"
433,"Swann to Clarke, no run well forward to start, driving to cover"
434,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke skips down, getting nicely to the pitch and driving down to long-off"
435,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run a nervous, airy waft outside off from Clarke. The ball hit the seam and jagged away from him, beating the outside edge"
436,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run tipped defensively towards point"
437,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run now, is this ball starting to reverse? It certainly appears so, this one snakes in through the air as Clarke drives back down the track."
438,"Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run this one goes the other way, a sharp reversing outswinger! The ball takes the outside half of the bat and bounces behind point"
439,"Shahzad to Watson, no run slower ball this time, Watson steps well forward and defends square"
440,"Shahzad to Watson, no run sliced slightly by Watson, on the drive, but along the ground to extra cover"
441,"Swann to Clarke, no run arm ball from Swann, it was much too short but Clarke couldn't do anything with it, his cut shot beaten on the top edge"
442,"Swann to Clarke, no run down the pitch, and the ball is chipped just short of midwicket! Scratchy stuff from Clarke"
443,"Swann to Clarke, no run he's down the track again, this time pushing back to the bowler"
444,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run chopped down to gully, quick single taken"
445,"Swann to Watson, no run a flicked drive goes straight to midwicket"
446,"Swann to Watson, FOUR runs ah, that ruins what had been a really good over! Speared down the leg side, Davies can't do anything about that and that's four"
447,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run Clarke is turned inside out by an outswinging, dipping low full-toss, popping it back to the bowler who fields in his follow through"
448,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run just short of a good length, Clarke is back and defending"
449,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run swinging out once again, the ball is full and wide and inviting the drive. Driven hard but straight to mid-off"
450,"Shahzad to Clarke, no run definite swing for Shahzad, Clarke isn't quite sure which way it's going to go and is squared up as he pushes to mid-off"
451,"Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run this one hoops in through the air, Clarke taps just wide of point and they sprint through"
452,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run inswing again, but it comes out as a half-volley and Watson pushes to deep mid-off for one"
453,"Swann to Watson, no run drift through the air for Swann, and as the ball rushes through he beats the outside edge! There's an appeal from the bowler, but that hasn't hit anything"
454,"Swann to Watson, 1 run turning in from outside off, cut out to deep point"
455,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run pulled across from outside off, down to long-on for one"
456,"Swann to Watson, no run full on off stump, flighted quite nicely and Watson drives back to the bowler"
457,"Swann to Watson, no run tossed up again by Swann, even slower this time, and again it goes back to the bowler"
458,"Swann to Watson, no run flicked to midwicket to end the over"
459,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 leg bye loosener on leg stump to start, nudged to short fine leg for a scampered single, off the thigh"
460,"Tremlett to Watson, no run on a length and straight, Watson plays back when he might have been forward, but taps to mid-on safely enough"
461,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 leg bye fired at leg stump, Watson misses an attempted glance but they take a leg bye off the pad"
462,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run worked off the hip into the leg side"
463,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run full and straight, driven down the ground for one"
464,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run Clarke lines up a front foot pull, but a thick inside edge cannons off the pad and - luckily for him - rolls wide of the stumps"
465,"Swann to Watson, no run floated up temptingly on off stump, solid defence from the batsman"
466,"Swann to Watson, FOUR runs Australia needed a boundary to keep things under control, and Watson has provided it! Slog sweep from him, well in front of square, and out to straight midwicket. He cramps up after playing the shot, wincing in pain, which isn't a good sign"
467,"Swann to Watson, no run Swann pulls the length back a touch and is quicker through the air, defended"
468,"Swann to Watson, 1 run pushed out to long-off for one"
469,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke dances out and takes the ball on the full, pushing down to long-on for one"
470,"Swann to Watson, 1 run a flat-footed swipe from Watson, it's chipped in the air towards long-off ... but bounces just short of Tremlett! Watson is starting to look a bit weary here, and is targeting the boundary"
471,"Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs glanced off the pad and out to deep square leg, they push hard for the second and Watson is strugging ... but he's back in time! The throw is also just wide, which helps"
472,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run tapped down to gully"
473,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run slower ball from Tremlett, or it's slightly slower through the air at any rate - the offcutter perhaps? Flicked straight to midwicket by Clarke"
474,"Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run short, Clarke's weight is forward but he pulls nicely down to fine leg, a controlled shot"
475,"Tremlett to Watson, no run tapped down just to Morgan's left at point, they think about the single but the fielder is round in a flash and hurling in a shy at the stumps"
476,"Tremlett to Watson, no run bursting past the outside edge! That moved appreciably off the seam"
477,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run pushed just behind square off the front foot"
478,"Swann to Watson, no run Watson is on the front foot, driving to cover"
479,"Swann to Watson, no run slightly too short, but skidding on and Watson can only nudge to midwicket"
480,"Swann to Watson, 1 run quicker one from Swann, pushed to the left of midwicket ... who slides but can't quite cut it off, a single is taken"
481,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run driven rather more firmly down to long-on"
482,"Swann to Watson, no run flat on off stump, Watson stays back and punches back to the bowler"
483,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run touch too short to start, forced out to deep cover"
484,"Yardy to Watson, no run arrowed down flat on leg stump, Watson flicks but finds square leg"
485,"Yardy to Watson, 2 runs very quick through the air, really darted, but too wide down leg this time and Watson glances down to fine leg"
486,"Yardy to Watson, FOUR runs heaved out to the straight midwicket boundary! Not the slog sweep, though he was down on one knee. Just swung across the line. Good connection"
487,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run punched to cover for one"
488,"Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke is forward, then back as he picks up the length, and nudging down to fine leg ... the throw comes back in very sharply as they come back for the second and is Clarke struggling here? They ask the third umpire to have a look! ... He's safe, but only just"
489,"Swann to Watson, no run whipped straight to man inside the circle at midwicket"
490,"Swann to Watson, no run tossed up outside off, Watson - on 94 - defends"
491,"Swann to Watson, 1 run leg-stump half-volley from Swann, and Watson brings up Australia's 150 with a glance to deep square"
492,"Swann to Clarke, no run quicker through the air, off the pad and straight to short fine leg"
493,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke jumps out and aims a wristy drive down to long-on"
494,"Swann to Watson, 2 runs worked wide of the midwicket fielder, and the come back for an easy two"
495,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run nudged to square leg, a diving fielder cuts it off but can't stop the single"
496,"Yardy to Watson, no run Watson presents the full face of the bat and drives back to the bowler. He deserves a ton here"
497,"Yardy to Watson, 1 leg bye off the foot and rolling to Trott at short fine leg"

502,"Trott to Watson, 1 run punched in the air down to long-on, another single taken"
503,"Trott to Clarke, 1 run nudged just behind square on the leg side, a scrambled one"
504,"Trott to Watson, 2 runs popped in the air! But just past Trott outstretched finger-tips, they sprint back for the second and there's the hundred for Watto! What a knock it's been, vital to his team's effort. Off comes the helmet, he's got a smile on his face and you can see how much that means"
505,"Trott to Watson, 1 run driven hard down to long-off"
506,"Trott to Clarke, 1 run tip-and-run into the covers to end the over"
507,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke uses his feet and takes the single down to long-on"
508,"Yardy to Watson, FOUR runs power! Watson stands tall and absolutely hammers this, sending the ball arcing over Yardy's head and down to the straight boundary"
509,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run and he follows that up with a quiet single to long-on, good batting"
510,"Yardy to Clarke, no run whipped to midwicket, straight to the fielder"
511,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run very full, Clarke almost yorks himself as he steps out but gets some bat on it to send the ball to short fine leg"

513,"Swann to Watson, no run full, worked to midwicket"
514,"Swann to Watson, 1 run driven down to long-on, just the single"
515,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke charges out of the crease but can't get to the pitch, defending"
516,"Swann to Clarke, no run this time he stays back, working to midwicket"
517,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run nicely driven down the ground, again just one run"
518,"Swann to Watson, 2 runs a tired swipe across the line from Watson, he didn't get the greatest connection but still picks up a run"
519,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run cracked past a diving extra cover, who gets a hand to it but can't stop the single. That sounded like a harder ball off the bat"
520,"Yardy to Watson, SIX runs huge! That is a really long boundary, and Watson has cleared it by some distance! It was a touch short and he just rocked back and clubbed it over midwicket"
521,"Yardy to Watson, SIX runs another! And this one's even bigger! This time he's on the front foot and slog-sweeping, getting right under it and lofting the ball deep into the crowd. Australia's fans are awake now!"
522,"Yardy to Watson, 2 runs he goes for it again, this one is miscued and swirls up into the Melbourne night! But falls safely! Watto can see the funny side"
523,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run nudged to fine leg for one"
524,"Yardy to Clarke, 1 run single down to long-on"
525,"Swann to Clarke, no run quick through the air, this newer ball has some bounce in it and it pops past the outside edge"
526,"Swann to Clarke, no run looped up much, much slower this time. Clarke comes down the track and defends back to the bowler"
527,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run yet another single from Clarke, down to long-on. What must his wagon-wheel look like..."
528,"Swann to Watson, 1 run swept hard by Watson, along the ground and scorching the turf down to long-leg ... but Shahzad is out there and fields cleanly"
529,"Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke comes down the track, and drives well down the track but straight back to the bowler"
530,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run a touch too short from Swann, Clarke backs away and cuts out to cover point"
531,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run back of a length from Tremlett to start, Clarke hops back to defend"
532,"Tremlett to Clarke, 4 runs pulled down to Pietersen in the deep ... and what's going on out there? A few moments of utter chaos from England in the field. The original return throw ricocheted off the stumps, and they took an extra two ... and then Bresnan's throw went through Strauss's legs at cover and they took another! Four runs! Tremors isn't happy"
533,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run back of a length again, defended to point"
534,"Tremlett to Clarke, 2 runs short, pulled in the air well in front of square on the leg side ... the ball plugs on the outfield though, just two"
535,"Tremlett to Clarke, no run more length from Tremlett, defence from Clarke, and lots of noise from the crowd!"
536,"Tremlett to Clarke, 2 runs shaping away through the air, Clarke steps forward and drives out to the cover sweeper, they take on the fielder and that's good running, he's back safely for two"
537,"Swann to Watson, no run huge swipe from Watson, he misses completely and is lucky not to be bowled there! That skidded on, if it had turned he was a goner"
538,"Swann to Watson, 2 runs top-edged just over Strauss at short fine leg! That popped off the glove and the England captain leapt up desperately but couldn't get a touch on it"
539,"Swann to Watson, 1 run more aggression from Watson, smiting a short one out to deep midwicket"
540,"Swann to Clarke, 1 run slashed down behind square on the off side"
541,"Swann to Watson, 1 run powerful sweep from Watson, it's in the air for some distance but falls well short of Bresnan in the deep"
542,"Swann to Clarke, no run that's gripped and turned! Popping up towards the hip, but negotiated by Clarke. And that ends Swann's contribution with the ball today"
543,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 leg bye short to start, Watson attempts a paddle-pull but can't get it away, just the one"
544,"Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run short again, pulled out to Pietersen and there's the 100 partnership"
545,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs muscled out into the leg side"
546,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run short yet again, pulled away and Trott charges round to keep them to one"
547,"Bresnan to Smith, no run dabbed down to short third man, Smith is desperate for the single but Watson sends him back just in time"
548,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run crashed firmly down the ground, a superb exhibition of the on-drive ... but it's just one run with the fielder out there"
549,"Shahzad to Smith, FOUR runs slower-ball bouncer, a thick edge as Smith flails and the ball evades Davies! He threw everything at it, right off the toe of the bat and down to third man. Australia need more of the same - boundaries that is, not edges!"
550,"Shahzad to Smith, 1 run short and fast, pulled away off the front foot to midwicket, just one"
551,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run back of a length, pulled in the air but dropping short of cow corner"
552,"Shahzad to Hussey, 1 wide yorker from Shahzad, but flung down the leg side. Hussey loses his footing and falls over"
553,"Shahzad to Hussey, 1 run tapped into space at cover, and they take the single"
554,"Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs slower ball from Bresnan, misdirected down the leg side. Hussey glances and, on fresh legs, is back for the second in a flash!"
555,"Bresnan to Hussey, FOUR runs half-volley on off stump, and classically driven by Hussey! Didn't try to over-hit it, just stepped forward and presented the face of the bat, bisecting mid-on and mid-off to collect four"
556,"Bresnan to Hussey, SIX runs short, pulled, the ball hangs in the air ... and that's landed right on the boundary marker! It was top-edged but there was pace on the ball and he went for it, Hussey is turning it on"
557,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run chopped down on the off side, gully dives to save the run"
558,"Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs worked off the hip, Hussey is like lightning between the stumps and is back for the second in quick time! How's Watto doing at the other end? He's blowing a bit..."
559,"Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run pushed to wide mid-on, there's a chance for another two if they push hard ... but Watson's knackered and says no"
560,"Shahzad to Hussey, no run huge, emotive appeal from Shahzad as Hussey is hit on the pad! But he's the only one to do so, and the umpire isn't interested. But they ask for the review. His foot is behind the line, so that's fine. No bat involved, it appears. But pitching just outside leg, so the decision stands. That was mighty close though!"
561,"Shahzad to Hussey, no run cracked very hard into the covers, but that's a great stop by the fielder"
562,"Shahzad to Hussey, 2 runs landing on leg stump, Hussey flicks down to fine leg"
563,"Shahzad to Hussey, 1 leg bye Shahzad goes full again, has this just come off the pad? They take a run, yep it's a leg bye"
564,"Shahzad to Watson, 1 run slower ball, tapped down to gully"
565,"Shahzad to Hussey, 1 run another slower ball, pushed towards mid-off and they scamper through"
566,"Bresnan to Hussey, no run full toss, slapped back to the bowler who fields in his follow through and hurls a shy at the stumps to send Hussey scampering back to his crease"
567,"Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs whipped well off the toes and out to deep midwicket, just the two runs as a tired Watson sweats the second"
568,"Bresnan to White, no run back of a length to start, tapped down to gully"
569,"Bresnan to White, 1 run this time he does get the single, down to third man"
570,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 wide Bresnan aims for the yorker, but sprays it down the leg side and the umpire signals wide. The bowler isn't happy, he thinks that clipped the pad. Watto is limping though, suggesting he's hit his own ankle with the bat"
571,"Bresnan to Watson, no run sharp yorker, and Watson is knocked off his feet! That was quick and right at his toes, Watson jammed down and slipped over as he did so"
572,"Yardy to White, no run driven on the up to Bell at cover"
573,"Yardy to White, 1 run crunched down to long-off, Watson back on strike"
574,"Yardy to Watson, no run fired full and fast at off stump. Medium pace, rather than spin!"
575,"Yardy to Watson, 1 run full again, Watson looks for the big shot but can only get one down to long-on. That is, however, his career-best score in ODIs"
576,"Yardy to White, 1 run flayed into the covers, Bell gets his hands to it to take the power out of the shot, good effort"
577,"Yardy to Watson, no run glanced to short fine leg, straight to the fielder and no run!"
578,"Tremlett to White, no run short, White doesn't pick it up and is struck in the midriff as he shapes to pull. That smarts a bit..."
579,"Tremlett to White, no run pressure! It's building now, White is struck on the pad as he's beaten by a bit of pace and bounce and is struck on the pad. The ball goes to point, no run"
580,"Tremlett to White, 1 run smeared across the line, down to long-on. There's the 250"
581,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run it is full, just outside off, driven hard into the ground and the ball bounces up and over Tremlett (no mean feat) and down to long-off"
582,"Tremlett to White, 1 run back of a length again, White swings hard but again it's just one to long-on."
583,"Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs full, swinging, but the line is wrong and there's the boundary Australia needed! Flicked down to fine leg, the ball beats the fielder at short fine"
584,"Bresnan to White, 1 run short, slower-ball bouncer and White pulls out to deep square"
585,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs full, lifted off the pads and bouncing out to deep midwicket. Shahzad charges round and fires in the return"
586,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run full, close to the yorker but he jams down hard on it and gets the ball down to long-on"
587,"Bresnan to White, no run back of a length, White tries to run it down to third man but can't beat the fielder in close."
588,"Bresnan to White, 2 runs slower ball, really quite short and White pulls out into the deep ... they charge back for the second!"
589,"Bresnan to White, 1 wide wide! Short again from Bresnan, the quick one this time but ballooning over the batsman and down the leg side"
590,"Bresnan to White, (no ball) 1 run no surprises, short again and pulled out into the deep ... and actually Bresnan's been no-balled for this bouncer! It won't be a Free Hit - his front foot was fine - but Bresnan's not happy. He says he wasn't told one for the over"
591,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs full, straight, clipped and two runs! Good over for Australia"
592,"Tremlett to White, 2 runs short, rising on White and he hooks ... the top edge goes miles up, Trott charges in and falls forward, he gets both hands to it but the ball bobbles out!"
593,"Tremlett to White, FOUR runs short again, hoicked wildly out to wide long-on, and that's four"
594,"Tremlett to White, 1 run the plan may just be misfiring now, White knows it's going to be short every ball and is waiting for it, pulling out to deep square leg"
595,"Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs full, swiped powerfully out to deep midwicket and there's 150 for Watto! His arms are aloft, the crowd cheer their approval and Australia are closing in on the win now"
596,"Tremlett to Watson, 1 run again Watson targets midwicket with the lofted shot, this time he doesn't get the best connection but the ball falls short of the fielder out there"
597,"Tremlett to White, 1 run short yet again, outside off but White hooks across into the leg side"
598,"Shahzad to White, 2 runs full, fast and swinging. The ball takes the inside half of the bat and rolls out on the leg side, and they're back for the second run"
599,"Shahzad to White, 1 run White lays bat on ball, tapping towards mid-off and setting off straight away for a scampered single"
600,"Shahzad to Watson, no run short, Watson ducks underneath it ... and that's one for the over"
601,"Shahzad to Watson, no run pinpoint yorker from Shahzad, and Watson can only dig it out back to the bowler."
602,"Shahzad to Watson, no run full toss, Watson whips into the leg side but hits Strauss at midwicket"
603,"Shahzad to Watson, 2 runs slower ball, full outside off and Watson swings it into the leg side ... it won't be the boundary though, Pietersen sprints across to cut it off"
604,"Bresnan to White, no run full, right in the blockhole. White slams down on it but mid-on charges round"
605,"Bresnan to White, FOUR runs the attempted yorker slips out as a low full toss, and White lifts it to the wide long-on boundary! Is that the blow that puts Australia definitively ahead?"
606,"Bresnan to White, no run another great yorker, White digs it out to cover"
607,"Bresnan to White, 1 run another full toss, this time White can't capitalise and picks up just one out to deep square"
608,"Bresnan to Watson, no run perfect yorker from Bresnan, you simply can't put that away and Watson digs it out to midwicket"
609,"Bresnan to Watson, 1 run very full, Watson meets it on the full and powers the ball down to long-on"
610,"Shahzad to Watson, SIX runs Watson roars Australia's victory! What a way to do it, a full toss is cracked baseball-style into the crowd behind long-on!"
611,"And that is all from your commentary team today. We hope you've enjoyed our coverage, and if you've missed any of the action do have a look at Andrew McGlashan's bulletin. The second game is in Hobart on Friday, see you then!"
612,"Australia win by six wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the one-day series, and Shane Watson has been their hero tonight. What an innings it was from him, one of the best one-day innings in recent memory. It was almost a chanceless knock, perfectly-paced and calm under pressure. There was always the feeling that if Australia could get someone to bat through the innings they'd finish on top. England were aggressive with the bat, but didn't use the last t"
613,Australia won by 6 wickets (with 5 balls remaining)
