0,"2pm: Australia win the toss and bowl, they have made four changes to their XI. Shane Watson returns to the top of the order, as expected, with Usman Khawaja making way; James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood and Agar all come in, replacing Nathan Coulter-Nile, Andrew Tye and Adam Zampa. South Africa welcome back Steyn in place of Kyle Abbott, while Farhaan B"

10,"Hastings to de Villiers, no run banged in and de Villiers gets in a tangle trying to pull... did that come off the glove on its way through? Hastings and Nevill were pretty convinced but umpire Shaun George less so. Looks like it came straight off the forearm"
11,"Hastings to de Villiers, no run short outside off, goes back and swings hard on the cut, fails to connect"
12,"Hastings to de Villiers, OUT bowled him, no doubt this time! De Villiers plays on, there'll be no Wanderers mauling this week... Tight lines from Hastings and de Villiers was trying to force it off the back foot, got a thick inside edge into off stump"

31,"Marsh to du Plessis, SIX runs length ball on leg stump... and it's been flicked into the crowd at deep square leg! Flamboyant stuff from Faf, a flamingo flick and it fair flew, well beyond the man standing on the rope - that rather spoiled an otherwise decent start from Marsh"
32,"Hazlewood to de Kock, FOUR runs skips out to hit Hazelwood off his length, clears mid-on and that'll bounce away"
33,"Hazlewood to de Kock, FOUR runs drags it a little shorter and this is hammered on the up over midwicket, back-to-back fours for Quinny"
34,"Hazlewood to de Kock, SIX runs oh my word! That's extraordinary... This time he targets the off side, opens up his body and launches an uppercut over the covers, it sails through the thin Highveld air several metres back into the crowd. Woof!"

47,"Faulkner to de Kock, 1 run another legbreak from Faulkner, steered through point to the sweeper"
48,"Faulkner to du Plessis, 1 run on the stumps and punched down the ground"
49,"Faulkner to de Kock, OUT bowled him, de Kock is chopped down! Looked like he played around a full toss but Faulkner is happy either way... It was full and straight, he tried to clip to leg and got an inside edge on to his stumps"

61,"Faulkner to Duminy, no run goes back outside off and steers a length ball to backward point"

75,"Agar to Miller, 1 run stately high arm from Agar, flighted outside off, chipped down the ground for one"

91,"Agar to Miller, SIX runs immense! Miller beats his chest like King Kong and then scrambles up the Empire State Building with Agar in his hand... Another breezy swing and the ball disappears into the crowd at long-on again!"
92,"Agar to Miller, OUT goes for another maximum but finds long-off! The bat skewed in the hands slightly, got under the shot and Maxwell positioned himself safely underneath to give Agar his maiden T20I wicket. Kong has been downed"

106,"Hazlewood to Morris, 1 run full and tailing towards leg stump as Morris backs away, can only chop it into the ground"
107,"Hazlewood to du Plessis, FOUR runs brings out the du-scoop! Faf finds the boundary, gets down low outside off stump and ramps a full delivery straight over the keeper and away... We've not seen much of that today"
108,"Hazlewood to du Plessis, FOUR runs back-to-back boundaries to the same part of the ground, this time via an inside edge! Made room to drive and picked up four more via a French cut - they all count"

112,"Hazlewood to Morris, 1 run full length, 140kph just outside off, dug out for a quick single into the covers"
113,"Faulkner to Morris, OUT slogged into the deep and taken! Morris aims for the big boomer over extra cover but doesn't quite have the power required and Warner leaps to take it above his head... A standing slap from Morris, who fails to cash in this time"
114,"Faulkner to du Plessis, 2 runs full and wide, possibly a slower ball, du Plessis mistimes a drive, ballooning over cover but it's squarer than Morris' shot and lands between two fielders"

116,"Faulkner to du Plessis, 1 run full on the stumps and clubbed through midwicket"
117,"Faulkner to Wiese, 2 runs pitched up on the toes, flicked firmly off leg stump and Wiese hurtles back for a second"
118,"Faulkner to Wiese, 2 runs goes for the blockhole again, slightly leg side and Wiese bunts it in front of long-on for a couple - but those are pretty nifty figures from Faulkner, 3 for 28 from his allocation"
119,"Hastings to du Plessis, FOUR runs full and straight but somehow du Plessis has managed to hack it away for four through square leg"
120,"Hastings to du Plessis, SIX runs boshed! Hastings misses his length and du Plessis plants another on into the crowd, a mighty swing over cover"

123,"Hastings to du Plessis, OUT picks out deep midwicket! The fun is over for Faf! Full toss does the job for Hastings, this time du Plessis didn't quite get hold of it and he found the man in the deep"
124,"Hastings to Wiese, SIX runs yes they can, what a strike from Wiese! He puts this in the top tier with a straight drive down the ground, a Thor-like hammer blow to finish the innings and take South Africa to a handy-looking 204. Hastings wipes his brow, having conceded 26 off the over"
125,"4pm: South Africa will feel that's at very least a score that keeps them in it. The world record chase in T20s came at this ground and SA are nearly 30 runs short of the total that was overhauled by West Indies last year - but 200 is always a stiff ask, particularly for a side low on confidence. Faf du Plessis provided the ballast, allowing others to"
126,Just a reminder what is chaseable on this ground.
127,Rababa will begin. He has a slip in...
128,"Rabada to Finch, no run short of a length outside off, pulled straight to mid-on"
129,"Rabada to Finch, 2 runs banged in short again, this time Finch goes squarer with his pull, gets it over midwicket without perfectly timing it...comes off more top edge than middle"

131,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run now he's back to the short ball, Smith pulls it behind square"
132,"Rabada to Watson, no run full at off stump, Watson comes onto the front foot and defends"

134,"Morris to Smith, FOUR runs fairly similar delivery, just a touch shorter outside off, Smith goes across the crease and pulls it through straight midwicket off the front foot"
135,"Morris to Smith, no run just short of midwicket! Another delivery banged in, Smith on the pull and he's beaten for pace, the ball comes off the handle and glove. Some pain for Smith"
136,"Morris to Smith, no run fuller outside off, a wild swing with his feet planted on leg stump...pretty much a slog"
137,"Morris to Smith, FOUR runs full and wide outside off, a much more controlled stroke this time as he drives it through the covers...not a million miles from the fielder, but placed well enough"
138,"Morris to Smith, 1 run width outside off, 147kph, Smith swings at it and gets a bottom edge wide of the stumps...smart piece of fielding from de Kock who collects and hits direct at the non-striker's end, but Smith is safe"
139,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run shuffles across the crease and flips a length delivery from outside off backward of square on the leg side"
140,"Rabada to Watson, no run angled into middle and leg, Watson doesn't make contact and it takes the pad to the leg side"
141,"Rabada to Watson, 1 run pushed onto the pads and flicked to long leg"
142,"Rabada to Smith, no run very short outside off, 146kph, and climbs over Smith's top edge as he has another wild swipe"
143,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run too quick for Smith, short outside off, and he tries to somehow get this to the leg side again and ends up with a thick outside edge down to third man with one hand off the bat. This isn't pretty from Smith"

145,"Steyn to Smith, 1 leg bye starts with a straight delivery which Smith aims into the leg side, the ball trickles to square leg"
146,"Steyn to Watson, no run short of a length outside off, 134kph, cut firmly into the ground and it bounces to point...Watson will feel that was a boundary ball"
147,"Steyn to Watson, no run he moves to the leg side against this shorter delivery and pulls to midwicket inside the circle"
148,"Steyn to Watson, no run fuller, this follows Watson as he moves outside leg, 133kph, and thunders into the pads"
149,"Steyn to Watson, FOUR runs connects well enough this time to beat mid-on, short outside off stump and Watson fetches it with the pull...still not ideally timed, but it's wide of the diving mid-on and beats deep midwicket"
150,"Steyn to Watson, no run moving outside leg stump again, Steyn follows him and it comes out as a full toss...Watson jabs it, rather alarmed, into the off side. Questions whether it should have been a no-ball. Looked just okay."
151,"Rabada to Smith, 1 wide appeal for a catch down the leg side, but it's called a wide...Smith moving around his crease, goes to help this off his hip. There was a noise and the ball wasn't near the pad. The replay suggests it was glove"
152,"Rabada to Smith, no run pushed into the off side"
153,"Rabada to Smith, SIX runs gets this one cleanly, it was a fuller ball and Smith was able to get underneath it with a (relatively) straight bat and lofts it over mid-on"

156,"Rabada to Watson, no run much fuller, on middle and leg, takes a thick outside edge into the covers as he aims into midwicket"
157,"Rabada to Watson, no run a bouncer, angled over leg stump, travels over the gloves and he escapes a wide call"
158,"Steyn to Smith, OUT oh, my goodness! What a catch by Rabada at third man. This is stunning and will take be a moment to explain. It was a short-of-a-length delivery outside off, Smith throws the kitchen sink at it and a top edge flies towards third man. Rabada started by running in and actually came too far. He realised, then just thrust up his"
159,"Steyn to Watson, no run beaten and tries to play this delivery into the off side, just a hint of swing"
160,"Steyn to Watson, FOUR runs width outside off, he goes for the upper cut and gets it wide of third man (even KG isn't reaching it)"
161,"Steyn to Watson, OUT another terrific catch! They are holding everything at the moment. Duminy running back from point this time. Short outside off, Watson having another full-blown swing at it. The ball doesn't have the distance this time, but Duminy still did superbly to take it over his shoulder. Would also have had Rabada in the corner of h"
162,"Steyn to Warner, no run lovely bowling...full outside off, Warner's feet not quite moving yet, the ball shapes in a touch the holds its line to beat the drive"

173,"Wiese to Maxwell, 2 runs back outside off stump, Maxwell drives and it comes off the toe of the bat towards third man"
174,"Wiese to Maxwell, 2 runs slashes again at some width outside off, Morris gets more work at third man and can't stop the second"

183,"Wiese to Warner, 1 run back of a length, driven to deep cover"
184,"Wiese to Maxwell, FOUR runs that slips out as a big full toss, gets heaved to deep square where there's bad misfield by Tahir which gifts a boundary...didn't quite anticipate the spin on the ball"
185,"Wiese to Maxwell, FOUR runs heaves a length delivery through straight midwicket, a skimming shot from Maxwell which bisects deep midwicket and long on"
186,"Wiese to Maxwell, 1 run another low full toss, straighter this time, swung to long on"
187,"Wiese to Warner, SIX runs short outside off and handsomely put away over deep midwicket with a strong-armed pull...a dragged down slower ball, so basically a long hop"
188,"Wiese to Warner, 1 run drives a full delivery into the covers"
189,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR runs flayed over the off side, a hint of width to Warner who throws his hands through the drive and sends it over cover"

204,"Tahir to Maxwell, 1 run flicked to deep midwicket"
205,"Tahir to Warner, no run full outside off, Warner aiming to deep midwicket with a slog sweep but gets an inside edge into his back leg"
206,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR runs that's just brute force, hammers it straight down the ground...wasn't quite so full, and it didn't even come out of the middle but comfortably split the deep fielders"
