0,"Starc to Roy, no run nice line and length in the channel outside off, lets it go"
1,"Starc to Roy, no run trapped in front but Roy reviews. That was a mighty close shout, pitched in line and nipped back in. Height may be an issue. and it is going over the stumps, so Roy survives. But he was playing all around that one, beaten by the movement inwards and groping with bat well away from ball"
2,"Starc to Roy, 2 runs pacy inswinger at 88mph, almost yorker length on off, Roy is coming forward but gets an inside edge that rolls to fine leg"

12,"Starc to Roy, FOUR runs length ball pushed across him, pushed sweetly but straight to wide-ish mid-on... and straight through him! Races away for four. Sloppy stuff from Cummins, and Starc looks to the sky in frustration"

14,"Starc to Roy, no run good length, angling across the right-hander with a bit of width at 90mph/145kph. Roy throws the bat again, but again can't make contact"

25,"Starc to Bairstow, OUT edged, gone! 90mph/145kph, pushed across the right-hander, and Bairstow nicks off. Starc had been hooping the ball into the batsmen but this one held its line and took the edge of Bairstow's apologetic prod. Australia get their breakthrough"

30,"Starc to Root, no run inside-edged into the body, and Root hits the deck! Length ball pushed across him as he looked to drive through the covers, but he only managed to inside-edge into the back knee and will get some treatment from the physio"
31,"Hazlewood to Roy, 1 run bit of nibble away, but Root steers behind square on the leg side as he comes across"
32,"Hazlewood to Root, 1 run shimmies down to flick into the leg side and scamper through for a single to wide mid-on. Doesn't look like that injury is causing him too much trouble, then"

43,"Starc to Root, OUT length on off stump, nudged into the covers for a sharp single and a direct hit means he's gone! Roy was running to the danger end and was miles short of his ground. Brilliant stuff from Stoinis, who picks up and throws in one smooth movement, and sets off in celebration after knocking down the stumps. Australia are buzzing!"

81,"Marsh to Morgan, no run back of a length ball, doesn't really get up off the surface and Marsh belts out an appeal as it hits Morgan on the pad! Finch isn't interested, though. Slower ball, and looked like it was going over the top"

92,"Marsh to Root, no run fuller on off, almost falls over while going across and clipping towards mid-on"
93,"Marsh to Root, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, punched off the back foot and there's a misfield at point which means it goes through and finds the boundary. Marnus there I think, who was moving to his left and tumbled to stop it but made a hash of it"

95,"Marsh to Root, no run back of a length on off, whipped off the back foot but can't go past midwicket"
96,"Marsh to Root, 1 run length ball, straighter, flicked to midwicket's right for a single"
97,"Marsh to Morgan, 2 runs another misfield, by short midwicket this time. Shimmies down the track and flicks it off his pads. The fielder lets it go through, though admittedly he didn't have a whole lot of time to react. Still should have stopped it. They get a couple"
98,"Cummins to Root, 3 runs uppish but in the gap through backward point. Full outside off, he opens the face to drive"

122,"Marsh to Root, no run clipped to midwicket"

136,"Zampa to Root, 2 runs tossed up, a bit too full, allows Root to sweep to deep square leg"
137,"Zampa to Root, OUT caught at slip. The move works, both to bring in Zampa and to have a slip for the right-hander. Nicely tossed up, Root's taking a step forward, but the ball dips before he can get to the pitch and turns just enough to take the outside edge. Smart take from Finch, to his right."

147,"Zampa to Morgan, no run fuller on off, driven to mid-off"
148,"Zampa to Morgan, FOUR runs reverse swept fine and he'll get a boundary. Great execution. Tossed up on off and he committed to the shot early, and got the placement right"
149,"Zampa to Morgan, FOUR runs oh nicely done. Morgan's shifted gears from 2 to 5 in the blink of an eye almost. Not that tossed up, but he gets to the pitch with a stride and uses wrists to drive over the in-field"

165,"Cummins to Morgan, no run length ball coming into him, punched back"
166,"Cummins to Morgan, FOUR runs stunning from Morgan. Seemed like an off-balance push but it goes straight past the bowler and into the boundary. He was making room, Cummins bowled it full, Morgan seemed to gently punch it back, off the toe end of the bat. Timed well enough to go all the way"

175,"Zampa to Morgan, OUT huge shout not given and Finch reviews. Great loop on this, pitches on a length on middle and turns past his forward defensive to hit him on the knee roll. and it's three reds so that's a fabulous review and an extremely critical wicket.

218,"Starc to Billings, 1 run full on the stumps, driven to mid-on"
219,"Zampa to Billings, OUT chopped on! Billings gave himself room to cut but this was too straight and cramped him for room. A flat legbreak, just a hint of turn and it zipped through, taking the bottom edge and diverted onto the stumps. Slightly fuller than Billings anticipated"

230,"Starc to Sam Curran, OUT nicks him off! Or does he? Gough, standing in his first game since the third Test vs Pakistan, isn't sure if it carried through to Carey. Starc ran his fingers down the side of this, hitting a length on fifth stump, and drew an outside edge as Curran looked to steer towards third man. The catch is a tight call, but it looks like it's going to be given, as Carey had just about got his gloves under the ball. Curran"
231,"Hazlewood to Woakes, 1 run bit of late movement back in as Woakes inside-edges into the back pad. Strangled appeal, but definitely bat first"

243,"Hazlewood to Woakes, OUT length ball in the channel, and Woakes is the latest man to nick off! Classic Hazlewood, banged in on a length on fourth or fifth stump, and there's just a fraction of movement away off the seam. That's enough to take the edge as Woakes shapes to punch through the covers, and Carey gobbles up an easy chance. England reeling at 149 for 8!"
244,"Hazlewood to Rashid, 1 run length ball, tucked round the corner to long leg"

269,"Cummins to Rashid, FOUR runs length on fourth stump, Rashid decides now is the time to accelerate and he heaves a one-bounce four over mid-on! The man was in the ring, and he rightly backed himself to clear himself"

296,"Cummins to Rashid, SIX runs banged in, back of a length, and Rashid swats at it, sending it over the rope for six!

306,"Marsh to Archer, FOUR runs slower ball into the pitch, Archer swings cross-batted and sends it back over Marsh's head for four! He set himself early, anticipating the short ball, and picked the slower ball early, bludgeoning it dead-straight down the ground"
307,"4.54pm: So England end on 231 for 9, and I doubt Australia will find it easy to knock those off and seal the series. Batting was a real struggle for England on a tough pitch, with Starc and Hazlewood irresistible with the new ball and Zampa superb through the middle. But Tom Curran added 76 in 9.3 overs with Rashid to propel England to a competitive score, and with a couple of early breakthroughs, they will be right in this one. Saurabh will be"

315,"Archer to Warner, 3 runs short and wide, Warner goes after it but only gets a toe-end to the cut. Carries over point but not enough legs to go to the boundary"

338,"Archer to Finch, FOUR runs gets on top of this and beats a diving point fielder to get a boundary. Width offered outside off, and room too with it being back of length. Finch gets on top of it and cuts nicely"
339,"Archer to Finch, no run fuller and straight on middle, goes back and across to clip from in front of his pads to midwicket"
340,"Archer to Finch, 4 leg byes Finch gets pinged on the helmet. That is one heck of a quick bouncer at 91 mph and on target. Finch moving across to pull but that's too quick for him. Bangs into the top of the helmet and they'll actually get four leg-byes for it. Finch seems fine but the docs will check on him as per protocol. The helmet took the brunt of the impact."
341,"Archer to Finch, no run another shot ball that has Finch hopping. This one isn't dug in as short, and it's outside off, Finch jabs at it with bat away from body and pushes to cover"
342,"Archer to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball strays down leg, flicks the thigh pad on the way to fine leg. Finch couldn't connect with his attempted glance but they'll get a leg-bye anyway"

352,"Archer to Finch, 1 run back of a length, pushed to cover. Quick single taken"
353,"Archer to Stoinis, OUT that is just amazing fast bowling Short leg was put in place so the batsman was expecting a short one, but Archer is so quick and so accurate that he manages to get a wicket with a short ball anyway. Banged in back of a length and hisses up like a cobra towards Stoinis who is all in a tangle against that. Fends awkwardly and it takes the shoulder of the bat to loop up for an easy catch behind him. Archer's bowling w"

360,"Woakes to Finch, no run another edge doesn't carry. drops well short of point. Finch is surprised by that one, bounces more off a length than he expected and takes the shoulder of the bat. He wasn't going hard at it though so it doesn't travel far"
361,"Archer to Labuschagne, no run length outside off, chopped towards point"

365,"Archer to Finch, 1 run fuller on off, Finch is hanging back but manages to stay well balanced in pushing this with soft hands towards mid-off. Goes for a quick single.

415,"Sam Curran to Finch, no run tight to the stumps, and Curran is very straight in line. Finch defends"

424,"Sam Curran to Finch, no run banged in, back of a length, and Finch jumps onto the back foot to defend. 83mph/134kph"
425,"Sam Curran to Finch, 1 run very wide on the crease, Finch drops into the off side and sets off for a sharp single. Roy get round to his right from backward point, but his throw is wide of the stumps at the bowler's end, and even a direct hit might not have got him"

436,"Sam Curran to Finch, 1 run slightly back of a length, and enough width for Finch to guide down to third man with an open face"
437,"Sam Curran to Labuschagne, no run length ball on fourth stump, clipped into the leg side. Root fields at short midwicket to prevent the single, and fortunately for him there's a man at mid-off to back up a wayward through to the bowler's end"
438,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run sharp legbreak, punched out to deep cover off the back foot"

443,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run tucked off the hip for a jogged single to short fine leg"

455,"Rashid to Finch, FOUR runs tossed up, full and straight, and Finch thumps it straight down the ground for four! Huge backlift and nailed through Rashid's hands, racing away from Billings at long-off to his right. Arguably a half-chance for the bowler, but it would have been one of the best catches of all time!"
456,"Rashid to Finch, no run tosses up a sharply-spun legbreak, which turns sharply away from the bat as Finch looks to heave another boundary over long-on"
457,"Archer to Labuschagne, 1 leg bye cross-seamer which nips away from Labuschagne as he looks to work to leg. He yelps in pain as he is struck on the back thigh pad, and Archer lets out a wry smile"
458,"Archer to Finch, no run length ball on fourth stump at 85mph/137kph, which Finch bravely leaves alone. It zips just past the top of off, vindicating his decision"
459,"Archer to Finch, no run banged in, slightly full of a length at 86mph/138kph. Finch inside-edges into the leg side, looking to play a checked drive"

467,"Woakes to Finch, 2 runs length on fourth stump, tip-and-run into the off side for a single that is never there, but Roy's throw is wide! Never a single, but Roy's throw to the keeper's end was wayward from backward point, and they steal a second run as Bairstow falls over while backing up. Chaos!"
468,"Woakes to Finch, no run nudged defensively into the leg side"
469,"Archer to Labuschagne, 1 run slower ball on a length, steered to backward point for a sharp single. Looked like a legcutter, I think"
470,"Archer to Finch, no run short ball in at the ribs, 89mph/143kph, and Finch wears one as he is late on the pull. Smashed him between the left pectoral and the biceps, and Finch swears in pain"

477,"Woakes to Labuschagne, 1 run nudged out to square leg for one, which brings up the 100-run stand from only 128 balls. These two have put Australia in control"
478,"Woakes to Finch, no run wide on the crease, bold leave from Finch as this keeps slightly low and nearly brushes his off stump! Nearly made to look very silly"
479,"Archer to Labuschagne, 1 run short outside off at 87mph/141kph. Labuschagne shapes to leave, but dangles the bat in the way of the ball to steer it down to third man for one. Not sure he knew much about where that was going"

481,"Archer to Labuschagne, no run slower ball, full on the stumps, and dug out towards mid-on. Might have been the knuckleball, dipped in late"
482,"Archer to Labuschagne, 2 runs back of a length, steered through gully and down to third man for a sharp two. Rashid should probably have done better running in from the boundary, but great running from Australia yet again"
483,"Archer to Labuschagne, 1 run length in the channel at 89mph/144kph, Labuschagne is late on it, and steers an awkward upper-cut over gully as he looks to withdraw the bat. Gets lucky, and it loops up to Rashid on the bounce"

488,"Woakes to Finch, 1 run length outside off, pressed out to cover and they scamper through for another tight single"
489,"Woakes to Labuschagne, OUT trapped on the pad, Woakes lets out a desperate appeal but Gough says no. Morgan reviews immediately. This struck both pads as he looked to work a length ball to leg, but crucially hit the front one first. No bat, Ultra-Edge confirms. Hits him in line, and would have smashed into middle two-thirds of the way up! Marnus has to trudge off, and Woakes has the breakthrough"

491,"Archer to Marsh, no run back of a length at 87mph/140kph, Marsh rides the bounce to guide into the covers"

499,"Woakes to Maxwell, no run length on off, keeps a bit low, jams his bat down"
500,"Woakes to Maxwell, 1 run comes on the front foot and opens the face to steer to third man"
501,"Archer to Maxwell, no run short fast, and into his rib cage. Maxwell wasn't even looking at it just turned around into a half-hearted pull. The ball thuds into bat. It was ball hitting bat, not bat hitting ball. 91 mph"

503,"Archer to Maxwell, no run slower one, at just 77 mph, nipping into him. Just about defended by Maxwell"

506,"Archer to Carey, no run and Archer ends a fantastic day with the ball with a sharply jagging in delivery that hits Carey on the thigh pad, defeating his back foot defence. Half an appeal but that was too high."

509,"Woakes to Cummins, no run full and on off, defended to cover"
510,"Woakes to Cummins, no run edge doesn't carry to slip. Pushing down the wrong line again, the ball also straightened off a length on middle. But soft hands so the ball bounces well before reaching Root at slip"

512,"Rashid to Cummins, 1 run googly that he didn't read, was coming forward to defend, takes the inside edge and rolls backward of square"
513,"Rashid to Carey, 1 run too full, and he comes on the front foot to flick this to wide long-on"
514,"Rashid to Cummins, no run tossed up, ends as a full toss, but Cummins can't put it away. Patted tamely to mid-on"
515,"Rashid to Cummins, no run big-spinning leg-break and Cummins was targetting cow corner with a big slog-sweep. Defeated completely"
516,"Rashid to Cummins, 1 run plays it more carefully this time, coming forward to a tossed up delivery and gently steering towards point"
517,"Rashid to Carey, 2 runs nicely done, saw the ball full and swept it fine. The man at fine leg is square so has to run to his left to field"

519,"Tom Curran to Carey, no run length into him to tuck him up, patted towards short midwicket"

544,"Tom Curran to Zampa, no run back of a length outside off, no pace or bounce to work with, his push finds the toe-end of the bat hitting ball and it not travelling very far"
545,"Tom Curran to Zampa, no run fuller on off, pushed firmly to mid-off"
546,"Sam Curran to Carey, 3 runs short and wide outside off, cuts it nicely through backward point. Good effort in the deep by Tom Currant to run around and cut off the boundary but the attempted relay through goes awry as he lobs it out of Morgan's reach. That allows the batsmen to take a third"

560,"Sam Curran to Zampa, no run and he changes up from bowling it short and into him to bowling a yorker on the fifth stump. Zampa tries to get low and get bat on it but can't. Good, smart bowling"

570,"Sam Curran to Hazlewood, 1 leg bye slips in the short ball, Hazlewood tries o paddle-pull it and the ball misses bat but hits his body and drops at his feet. Sam rushes across in his follow through and kicks the ball onto the stumps but Carey was quick off the blocks and makes his ground"
571,"Sam Curran to Carey, 1 run just can't get them away. This one is dug into a length and doesn't come on to the bat as Carey shapes to slap it away. Gets it through cover but no further"
