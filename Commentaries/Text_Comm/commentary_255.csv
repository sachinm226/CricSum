202,"Thompson to Smith, OUT edged and taken. Ireland get the big wicket of Steven Smith. Great, reflex catch by Niall. Shortish length outside off, Smith looks to guide down to third man or punch it wide of point but gets a thick outside edge which flies towards Niall who dives very nicely low to his right to hang on to a stunner."
203,"Thompson to Marsh, no run almost hits the off stump. Very good leave or very bad leave? Good length, pitched just outside off. Marsh chooses to leave, There is no movement and just misses that off stump."
204,"Thompson to Marsh, no run much wider outside off, Marsh leaves with much more confidence"
205,"Thompson to Marsh, no run fullish again outside off, Marsh chooses to drive this time but gets an inside edge onto his boot."
206,"Thompson to Marsh, no run good length on off, Marsh defends nicely off the back foot to cover"
207,"Stirling to Watson, 1 run short and wide, not what you want to be bowling to Watson who rocks back and thrashes a cut to the sweeper"
208,"Stirling to Marsh, 1 run slightly slow and flat, no spin. Marsh stays back and works the ball to midwicket with the turn"
209,"Stirling to Watson, 1 run just a bit short and Watson is quick on his trademark pull. Hits it well and times it well but fails to pick the gap well, just the one"
210,"Stirling to Marsh, no run tossed up on middle, Marsh works to midwicket"
211,"Stirling to Marsh, no run full and flat, Marsh fails to connect with the ball as it hits his pads."
212,"Stirling to Marsh, no run flat and slow on middle, Marsh turns it off his pads once more to the tight of midwicket who dives to stop. lots of miscommunication between the batsmen but they make the right decision to turn the single down"
213,"Thompson to Watson, 2 runs what a shot Shane Watson. Full and straight on middle, Watson stays in his crease, lets the ball come to him and thrashes the clip wide of midwicket. Very good to watch when in flow"
214,"Thompson to Watson, 1 run short and wide this time, Watson rocks back and plays the upper cut to third man."
215,"Thompson to Marsh, 2 runs nicely timed and placed by MM. Short and slightly wide allowing Marsh to stand tall and punch wide of the cover fielder. Easy brace."
216,"Thompson to Marsh, FOUR runs oh great shot selection and picked the right ball to execute too. Full on a fifth-stump line, Marsh effortlessly lofts the ball over mid-off."
217,"Thompson to Marsh, 1 run full again but closer to the off stump, Marsh pushes with an angled bat towards long-off"
218,"Thompson to Watson, SIX runs even better from Watto. Just a tad short again and Watson is extremely quick on the pull. Stays in his crease, picks the length and flat-bats with a lot of muscle power over square leg. Goes a few metres over the boundary"
219,"McBrine to Burns, 1 run short and spinning in to Burns who rocks back and hits the drive to the deep cover"
220,"McBrine to Warner, SIX runs what a shot. picks the delivery to go after and the execution is exemplary. Flighted on middle, Warner comes down the track and meets the ball as it pitched, deposits it over long-on"

222,"McBrine to Burns, 1 run flat outside off, punched off the front foot to deep point"

224,"McBrine to Burns, 2 runs short and wide, cut away off the back foot in front of third man. Easily done"
225,"Young to Warner, no run big appeal but not given again. Pitched well outside leg, Warner is late on the flick and is struck right in front of middle stump. Good decision"
226,"Young to Warner, 1 run fuller on middle, drilled to long-on fiercely"
227,"Young to Burns, 1 run fuller length again on off stump. Burns skews the delivery over point for one. Uppish but wide of the fielder"
228,"Young to Warner, 1 leg bye drifting on Warner's pads who misses the tuck, they get the leg bye though as it rolls off into the leg side"
229,"Young to Burns, OUT gone this time. Shortish length on middle, Burns picks the length early and wants to pull over square leg but gets a thick top edge which flies in the air with no distance. Niall gets under it and takes a comfortable catch. The umpires take a look at the front line again but this time he is behind the line."
230,"Young to Warner, SIX runs shot of the day for me. Just a tad short, and Warner is very quick on the length much like Burns but the difference was the execution. Perfectly executed and timed, goes well over square leg for a massive six."

236,"Stirling to Marsh, 1 run flat on middle this time, drilled to long-on"
237,"Mooney to Marsh, OUT straight up in the air and taken. marsh goes now. Mooney cleverly delivers it from wider of the crease with a bit of leg cut, Marsh looks to hit over long-off again but the change in point of delivery helps taking the outer half of the bat. Murtagh settles under it and takes a good catch."
238,"Mooney to Watson, no run slower delivery on leg, Watson fails to flick and is clipped on the pads"
239,"Mooney to Watson, no run comes back in with the angle this time. Good length from outside off into off, Watson looks to punch but the ball takes the inside edge because of that wide angle. Good bowling"
240,"Mooney to Watson, FOUR runs angle doesn't matter that much when it is overpitched. Full on off and Watson drills powerfully down the ground. Wow, some power there. Goes to the long-off boundary in a flash"
241,"Mooney to Watson, 1 run shortish outside off, Watson cuts to point where there is a tumbling half-stop"
242,"Mooney to Wade, 1 run good length outside off, Wade just gets bat on it to guide it to the left of point for one"

244,"Stirling to Watson, 1 run flat outside off, Watson drills the ball wide of cover for one"
245,"3.45pm And the rain has got heavy now and the players are off. Well, it was always coming. Very heavy now in fact. The covers are coming on with some vigour. This could be the end of the innings if the rain settles in for a bit. The whole square is covered for the moment. This could be a lengthy delay but I'll be here to update you whenever I have something."
246,4.00pm Still raining at the moment.
247,4.18pm The rain has stopped now. The groundstaff are diligently working on the covers
248,"4.25pm Australia's innings is finished. Inspection at 5 pm. Maximum, we can have a 40-over game but could be curtailed even below that."
249,"FYI, 30-over game, target = 209 25-over game, target = 185"
250,"4.58pm The sun is out now, so only a matter of how much water has fallen on the outfield and the deterioration of the pitch. If it is a 40-over match, target for Ireland will be 248. In the event it is reduced to the minimum 20 overs, target will be 158. So those are the extremes, the target and the amount of overs should be somewhere in between."
251,"5.10pm A lot of chaos among our followers regarding the reason Ireland may have to chase more than what Australia actually scored. Considering it was a 47-over match or as was later reduced, a 46-over match, Australia could have had the opportunity to score those extra runs in those few overs. However, taking into account Australia set themselves up to play a 47-over match, the D/L method takes this into"
252,5.15pm A restart is imminent with the sun shining in all its glory. A revised target will be updated for you when I have it.
253,"5.17pm Play will resume at 5.40 pm, which is a little over 20 minutes from now. Should be between a 25 and 30 over game."
254,"5.30pm Ireland will have to chase 195 in 27 overs, all this provided there is no more rain. For now, we have a game on and a compelling one too. Bright and sunny at the moment."
255,"5.38pm Paul Stirling and William Porterfield will open for Ireland. A reminder that two bowlers can bowl a maximum of six overs, and three bowlers can bowl five. Mitchell Starc will open the bowling. Two slips in place. Let's resume."
256,"Starc to Porterfield, FOUR runs what a shot first ball, full and straight on leg stump. No swing whatsoever. WP just times his flick wide of square leg and it flies away to the boundary"
257,"Starc to Porterfield, no run fullish again, no swing here either. Porterfield stays in his crease and pushes to mid-on with the angle created by Starc"
258,"Starc to Porterfield, 1 wide strays in line this time. Starc is looking for some swing but there is absolutely none. Goes down leg and wide called"
259,"Starc to Porterfield, no run corrects his line now. But the length is a tad too full. Slightly wide of off and the batsman drives to mid-off off the front foot"
260,"Starc to Porterfield, no run corrects the length now. Good length, but a bit too leg sid-ish. Porterfield pushes the ball to mid-on"
261,"Starc to Porterfield, OUT one good ball is all you need though. Starc gets one absolutely right. Very full on middle and leg, one of Starc's trademark yorkers. Sneaks past Porterfield's bat, takes a bit of his pad and takes the stumps more importantly. Unplayable delivery, came back in late to WP who had no chance against a delivery as good as that"
262,"Starc to Joyce, 2 runs oh nice start from Joyce. Staying low, preparing for that yorker. Starc delivers is full and a bit wide of off, Joyce lets the ball come to him before deflecting the ball nicely with a drive through point. Nicely played, good technique"
263,"Coulter-Nile to Stirling, no run swing and beaten. Flashed outside the off stump by Stirling. A bit wide on a good length swinging away. Stirling drives but doesn't connect"
264,"Coulter-Nile to Stirling, no run a bit fuller this time but outside off again, Stirling stays in his crease and pushes to mid-off with minimal feel movement"
265,"Coulter-Nile to Stirling, no run brings it much straighter this time, good length but drifting on leg stump. Stirling is beaten for pace as he tries to flick, the ball hits im on the thigh pad"
266,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, 1 wide ooh, quick bouncer. Well directed at NOB's badge. He ducks under it very late and very awkwardly, called wide though"
267,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, 1 run well bowled again, pitching on a good length outside off, NOB opens the face of the bat to get it to third man. Unconvincingly played"
268,"Coulter-Nile to Joyce, no run beaten for pace again. Short length on leg stump, has Joyce jumping and hopping. He is struck high on the leg"
269,"Starc to N O'Brien, no run very full again just outside off, maybe just a hint of tail. NOB is happy to let it go"
270,"Starc to N O'Brien, 1 run almost gets through once again. Wow. Some serious pace here. Very full and straight, definitely some in swing. NOB just about gets bat on it but not a lot of the bat, a thick inside edge takes it down to fine leg"
271,"Starc to Joyce, no run slightly fuller than a good length on off stump, Joyce gets behind the line and blocks"
272,"Starc to Joyce, no run very full and wide, some out swing now. Hmm, interesting time for these Ireland batsmen. Joyce leaves confidently"
273,"Starc to Joyce, no run yorker on middle with some in swing. Joyce walks across and flicks uppishly towards square leg. Don't miss that Ed."
274,"Starc to Joyce, 2 runs decent stroke. A bit short and wide, Joyce likes the width as he lofts the ball over cover with a decently timed cut. They get through for two."
275,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run yorker from NCN this time on off stump. O'Brien plays it nicely though. Pushes at the ball and digs it out to cover"
276,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run good length outside off which takes off from that length. Definitely a by-product of the pace. NOB shoulders arms"
277,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run massive appeal, turned down though. A lot of doubt there. May have pitched outside leg, comes back in and strikes NOB high on the pad as he is jumping. May have gone over the stumps"
278,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run shortish length outside off, pushed with no timing into the circle in the off side"
279,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run better appeal but not given again. That was definitely not high, enough doubt regarding where the ball pitched though. Maybe just outside the leg stumpas the ball raps NOB on the pads. Very close call"
280,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, 1 run shortish length outside off this time, NOB gets on top of the bounce and guides this to third man"
281,"Starc to N O'Brien, FOUR runs full yorker on middle again, very quick but just a little bit predictable now. Comes in with the angle and NOB nicely deflects the ball past square leg."
282,"Starc to N O'Brien, no run full and wide, delectably hit to cover with a lot of confidence. Superb shot for none"
283,"Starc to N O'Brien, FOUR runs oh man, even better. I can't decide which shot is better. Full and wide again, NOB stays on the back foot, and leans into the drive to get it through cover. Amazing timing"
284,"Starc to N O'Brien, no run full yorker outside off this time. NOB gets an under edge on it which goes to Smith at second slip"
285,"Starc to N O'Brien, 1 run a bit shortish this time, O'Brien guides it to third man with the open bat face"
286,"Starc to Joyce, 2 runs low full toss this time, Joyce stays back and just times the on drive past the non-striker. Didn't look to hit that too hard which is always key"
287,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run in swing to the left-hander from NCN. A bit full outside off coming back in, NOB gets a thick inside edge onto his pads"
288,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, no run full again but a bit leg side-ish. NOB was not anticipating that line and therefore just bunts the ball into the leg side"
289,"Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, 1 run short and wide from NCN. O'Brien likes the width and flays at the ball with a thick outside edge, gets it down to third man uppishly and on the bounce"
290,"Coulter-Nile to Joyce, no run fullish outside off, driven to mid-off with not much feet movement"

298,"Cummins to Joyce, 1 run back of a length outside off, ample time for Joyce to open the face of the bat and dab to third man"
299,"Marsh to Joyce, SIX runs oh goodness, what a shot. Full outside off, Joyce clears one foot and smashes it down the ground over the bowler's head. Amazing shot that was. Great stuff from EJ."
300,"Marsh to Joyce, 2 runs may have been a slower delivery outside off, Joyce is late to bring bat down on it but gets some part of the inside edge as the ball evades leg stump and goes to fine leg"
301,"Marsh to Joyce, 1 run fullish outside off, Joyce deliberately opens the face of the bat and plays it late to get the ball to third man. Nice batting this"

303,"Marsh to Joyce, 2 runs short and wide, Joyce doesn't miss out though. Plays it really nicely off the front foot in the air past cover, with a nice cut shot. Good placement too"

305,"Cummins to Joyce, 1 run fullish outside off, driven off the front foot to the sweeper cover"
306,"Cummins to N O'Brien, 1 run a bit shortish again on middle and leg, worked off his hips into the vacant midwicket region"
307,"Cummins to Joyce, 2 runs flat-batted over cover. More of a smear there. Short on middle, Joyce looks to hit it down the ground but the ball hurries onto him as he tries to pull but he gets enough of it to take it over cover"
308,"Cummins to Joyce, 1 run what a shot once more. Amazing to watch, short and slightly wide of off stump, cut away with an angled bat to the sweper"
309,"Cummins to N O'Brien, no run oh, that is hit him, wow. That took off from a good length. Pitched shorter than a good length and O'Brien looks to play into the off side but the ball keeps climbing onto him and smashes him on the grill of the helmet. The Australia players enquire whether he is ok and he is."
310,"Cummins to N O'Brien, 1 run fullish on leg stump which NOB nicely whips off his pads to midwicket"
311,"Marsh to N O'Brien, no run short on leg stump, O'Brien walks well across off stump but the ball goes over leg stump. Good decision by the umpire not to call that a wide"

313,"Marsh to N O'Brien, FOUR runs comes down the track and smashes the length delivery over cover. Gives himself a touch of room to open up the off side and does that nicely. Well executed stroke"

389,"Starc to McBrine, (no ball) 1 run no ball this time, but what was that for? Slightly high full toss outside off, which is helped on its way to third man. May have been a height no ball"

395,"7.45pm So, Ireland fought hard but Australia were a bit too strong for them today. They were in the game for large parts of that chase but was a hard task with the depth in Australia's bowling line up. Joyce and O'Brien played really well in the middle but the rest of the batsmen struggled to do much. Australia were not at their best but they found a way to get past the tough competition from Ireland wit"
