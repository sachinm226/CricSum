0,"Starc to Roy, no run back of a length, pushed across Roy who leaves it alone...doubt we'll see many of them"
1,"Starc to Roy, 2 runs similar line and length, this time Roy cuts it behind point and wide of third man to get off the mark"
2,"Starc to Roy, 1 wide some swing there, but started on the wrong line and slipped down the leg side"
3,"Starc to Roy, 1 wide now that's flung very wide outside off, almost misses the cut strip"
4,"Starc to Roy, 2 runs gets back around off stump, but that's a lovely piece of timing by Roy as he pushes forward and places it square through the covers...Warner chases it down well with a flick back just before the rope"
5,"Starc to Roy, no run full outside off, 89mph, through to the keeper"
6,"Starc to Roy, 1 wide another one down the leg side, Starc's radar isn't in sync yet. Long over to start with"
7,"Starc to Roy, no run spears into the pads, a strangled appeal for lbw but that pitched outside leg stump...did Roy a little for pace, though"
8,"Starc to Roy, no run a wild swing and a miss to a length ball outside off...a lengthy, wayward over so costing seven isn't too bad a result for Australia"
9,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 run on a length, angled into the pads, tucked out to deep square leg"
10,"Coulter-Nile to Roy, no run short delivery, around middle and off, but not a full on bouncer...Roy is through his pull shot early and takes it in the stomach"
11,"Coulter-Nile to Roy, 1 run uses his feet then swings through the line of a full delivery, skews off a thick outside edge and carries towards third man but lands in front of the fielder"
12,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run full at off stump, 86mph, defended to the leg side"
13,"Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 run works with the angle coming into him, flicked into square leg"
14,"Coulter-Nile to Roy, 1 run well bowled, a length ball nipping into him which he drops towards mid-on for a quick single"
15,"Starc to Roy, no run heaves a length delivery into the leg side but picks out the man in front of square"
16,"Starc to Roy, no run fuller this time, at the stumps, 90mph, driven into the leg side"
17,"Starc to Roy, no run full outside off, Roy was giving himself some room to leg so had to stretch for the delivery and couldn't make contact"
18,"Starc to Roy, FOUR runs lovely stroke, a whip-pull by Roy as Starc drops short...placement was the key as he slotted it wide of the man at deep square"
19,"Starc to Roy, 1 run back to a full length and it's forced with a straight bat through midwicket but a strong throw from Stoinis keeps them to a single"
20,"Starc to Hales, 1 run full at middle and off, 90mph, drop and run into the off side...a smart way to score off the good balls"
21,"Cummins to Hales, no run appeal for lbw, a full ball spearing into the pads but that appeared to he shading down the leg side as Hales misses his whip to the leg side"
22,"Cummins to Hales, no run another big appeal! A full toss this time. Michael Gough shakes his head again. That looked a bit closer. Replays show it was missing leg."
23,"Cummins to Hales, OUT well, that's done it! 91mph, Hales done for pace. Another low full toss, Hales is late on the stroke, gets an inside edge onto the pads then into the stumps"
24,"Cummins to Ali, 1 run yorker-length outside off, 93mph, that's some heat, and Moeen jabs it down to third man off the toe of the bat"
25,"Cummins to Roy, no run confident drive from Roy as he strides forward to a full ball on off stump but picks out cover"
26,"Cummins to Roy, OUT and another! Two in the over for Cummins. Roy tries to launch a length delivery over the off side, but gets more elevation that distance...still, took a very good catch by Coulter-Nile as he back-tracked from mid-off"
27,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run short of a length outside off, Morgan holds his bat inside the line and it goes through to Wade"
28,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run fuller at middle and off, 88mph, pushed firmly back down the pitch"
29,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run hint of width, cut in the air through the vacant gully area to third man"

31,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, 3 runs that's a gorgeous piece of timing, punches a back-of-a-length delivery wide of mid-off but it's heading towards one of the long corners on the ground"
32,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run done for pace by a ball which slides across outside off"
33,"Cummins to Ali, no run plays over the top of a full delivery outside off...91mph"

35,"Cummins to Ali, no run fuller this time, another drive again finds mid-off"
36,"Cummins to Ali, 1 run direct hit! But Moeen's makes it with a dive. He picked out mid-off, again, with a drive but this time opted to sprint off for the run"
37,"Cummins to Morgan, no run excellent pressure being built as Morgan drives a full delivery to mid-off"
38,"Cummins to Morgan, FOUR runs finds the gap this time, drives through the line and this time opens the face a fraction to place it wide of cover...that whistled off the bat"

40,"Marsh to Ali, no run drags the length back, pushed into the backward-point area"
41,"Marsh to Ali, 1 run tight on middle and off, slower at 75mph, pushed into the off side"
42,"Marsh to Morgan, no run comes down the pitch then gets beaten on the under edge as he tries to play through the off side...ball travels over the stumps"
43,"Marsh to Morgan, FOUR runs short ball at the body, Morgan swivels on a pull which goes very fine to one of the shorter, straight boundaries"
44,"Marsh to Morgan, 1 run back of a length outside off, a cutter, chopped down to third man"
45,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run round the wicket, touch short but Morgan cracks it straight to cover"

47,"Maxwell to Ali, 1 run flicked through midwicket"
48,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run fuller at the stumps, driven down to long-off"
49,"Maxwell to Ali, no run fired in at the pads, Moeen goes for a sweep but doesn't make contact and the ball bobbles to short fine leg"
50,"Maxwell to Ali, 3 runs drops short this time, Moeen latches on with a pull in front of square...Starc at deep square makes a good diving save, but then makes a bit of a best of trying to get the ball back. The batsmen take a third, and then Morgan has to dive to make his ground"
51,"Stoinis to Ali, no run on a length at off stump, 74mph, pushed into the off side"
52,"Stoinis to Ali, SIX runs that's a mighty blow! Dragged down short, Moeen is already coming down the pitch and then he pulls it handsomely over deep square leg"
53,"Stoinis to Ali, FOUR runs short again, around off stump, sits up nicely and Moeen dismissively bludgeons him through straight midwicket"
54,"Stoinis to Ali, 1 run gets this a little fuller, driven down to long-off"
55,"Stoinis to Morgan, 1 run another short ball, Morgan's pull is not as convincing as Moeen's earlier in the over, takes a top edge, but lands short of deep square"
56,"Stoinis to Ali, 1 run fuller outside off, driven square out to deep point"
57,"Maxwell to Ali, 1 run flicked from around off stump down to long-on"
58,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run uses his feet, Maxwell drags the length back and Morgan can only nudge into the leg side...thought of a second for a moment as Wade chases it"
59,"Maxwell to Ali, 1 run sweeps a straight delivery to short fine leg"
60,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run follows Morgan as he moves to the leg side, the pull comes from high on the bat and lobs down towards long-on"
61,"Maxwell to Ali, 1 run width outside off, cut to deep cover"
62,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run ends up cutting this delivery from well outside leg as he had moved so far to the on side, picks out deep cover"
63,"Marsh to Morgan, FOUR runs he sounds the bugle, comes down the pitch and clubs a length delivery over mid-on...not clearly timed, off the bottom of the bat, but easily cleared mid-on"
64,"Marsh to Morgan, SIX runs ah, that's sweet! Gee, that made a good sound. Drills through the line of a fuller delivery and sends it perfectly straight down the ground"
65,"Marsh to Morgan, 1 run a lot of slower balls from Marsh, this one nudged into the leg side"
66,"Marsh to Ali, no run a slower bouncer now, outside off at 72mph, Moeen is through his pull far too early"

73,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, FOUR runs gets right across his stumps this time, it's a fuller ball and his wrists come into play as he flicks it wide of short fine-leg. Hands on head for the bowler"
74,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, no run outside off, clubbed back to the bowler"
75,"Watson to Morgan, 2 runs full outside off, skewed over point as Morgan tries clear the off side...the bat face turned in his hand"
76,"Watson to Morgan, SIX runs what a shot! Astonishing power from Morgan, albeit to the shorter boundary, as he comes down the pitch. Watson saw him, dropped it shorter but Morgan was still able to muscle it over long-off with a cross-batted swing"
77,"Watson to Morgan, no run driven in the air but short of cover"
78,"Watson to Morgan, no run shuffles across his crease, Watson pushes it outside off and Morgan is beaten"
79,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run full at the stumps, driven down the ground"
80,"Watson to Ali, 2 runs drives a full ball very firmly through the off side, stayed on leg stump so he could free his arms, all along the ground wide of the sweeper"

82,"Boyce to Ali, SIX runs he targets the short boundary, basically just slugs a length delivery straight down the ground"

84,"Boyce to Ali, SIX runs that's bigger! Uses his feet and picks up a delivery around leg stump with a free swing of the arms over deep midwicket. Effortless."
85,"Boyce to Ali, 1 run a quicker ball, fired it around leg stump, pushed down the ground"
86,"Boyce to Morgan, 1 run full outside off, chopped into the ground off a bottom edge and bobbles to point"
87,"Watson to Morgan, SIX runs six more! The charge is well and truly on. Another supreme strike by Morgan as he drives a full delivery well over long on"
88,"Watson to Morgan, 2 runs low full toss outside off, driven sweetly through the off side and the sweeper can't stop the second"
89,"Watson to Morgan, no run gets a leading edge as he aims to work a delivery off his pads but it loops short of Smith running in from cover"
90,"Watson to Morgan, SIX runs into the crowd again! Terrific way to go to fifty off 32 balls...hoicks a short ball over deep square leg even though he was cramped for a little room"
91,"Watson to Morgan, SIX runs brilliant strike, hammers through the line of a full ball as Watson tries to mix up his length but it just goes straight back over his head"
92,"Watson to Morgan, 1 wide the pressure tells, fired miles outside off stump"

96,"Cummins to Morgan, 1 run gets a yorker in which is squeezed to the covers"

99,"Cummins to Morgan, SIX runs that's one of the longer boundaries...and it's six again. Cummins drops it short and Morgan pulls emphatically over deep midwicket"
100,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, 1 run he goes straight down the ground, too, but clothed a little by Moeen"
101,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, OUT gets underneath this, goes miles into the Cardiff sky and does not quite have the distance this time as Watson settles under it just inside the rope at long on"
102,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, no run that's sharp, a short ball at leg stump which beats Moeen over the top edge"
103,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, 2 runs fuller this time, heaved through midwicket and places it between two of the deep men"
104,"Coulter-Nile to Ali, 1 run short of a length, Moeen moves to the leg side and pulls over midwicket...doesn't quite fine the middle"
105,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run back of a length, straight, tucked into the leg side...good over from NCL and a good spell"

108,"Starc to Buttler, 1 wide a wide full toss outside off"
109,"Starc to Buttler, OUT finds mid-on...clubs a length delivery and doesn't get elevation or placement. A brief, lively stay for Buttler. Next!"

116,"Cummins to Ali, 2 leg byes somehow gets this down to third man, goes right across the crease outside off and aims to work to the leg side then the ball takes the pad...a better throw and he would have been struggling"
117,"Cummins to Ali, 1 run full at the stumps, 91mph, driven firmly to deep cover"
118,"Cummins to Billings, 1 leg bye done for pace again, nudging 94mph, rattles into the top of his leg as he tries to pull and the leg bye means it keeps the strike which Australia won't mind"
119,"Starc to Billings, 1 run round the wicket, full outside leg, Billings gets a leading edge out to deep cover"

121,"Starc to Ali, 1 run low full toss, this time he drives out to deep cover so loses the strike"
122,"Starc to Billings, OUT a straight, low full toss is driven straight to mid-off...Smith's throw is on target, Starc takes the bails off. Billings struggled today"
123,"Starc to Ali, 1 run well bowled, yorker outside off, Moeen can only heave into the leg side"
124,"Starc to Stokes, 1 run one ball for Stokes, it's a low full toss which he crunches straight to mid-off who is inside the circle"
125,"That's a good finish for Australia - 30 off the last four overs - but still a strong total for England based around two fantastic innings from Moeen Ali and Eoin Morgan. It was a case of the quicker they bowled, the better for Australia. Starc, Cummins and Coulter-Nile very good. The others"
126,"We are just about ready for the chase...Warner and Watson to open for Australia. If they win this, it will be their second-highest T20 chase ever. David Willey with the opening over..."
127,"Willey to Warner, no run back of a length outside off, takes the toe of the bat towards cover"
128,"Willey to Warner, 2 runs gets this through the in field, comes onto the front foot and drives between cover and mid-off"

131,"Willey to Warner, 2 runs full delivery, Warner lofts it over the off side but without quite his full power"
132,"Willey to Warner, OUT gone! Taken at third man! Curious dismissal, but not entirely dissimilar to a couple of the Test dismissals when he was out pulling. Was a shorter delivery, Warner wanted to play into the leg side and got into a bit of a tangle, the ball took the thick leading ed"

148,"Finn to Smith, FOUR runs short on off stump, Smith gets inside the line and pulls behind square...had some much time"
149,"Finn to Smith, 1 run super fielding by Stokes, driven on the up into backward point and he flings himself low to his left to cut off a boundary...almost made it a blinding catch, to"
