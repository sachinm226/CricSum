6,"Turner to Mahedi Hasan, FOUR runs sweeps to fine leg for four! This was bowled full on his pads, and he went down on his back knee to slap that away for the first boundary. Good end to the over"
7,"Agar to Mohammad Naim, SIX runs swung away for six over deep square leg! He too goes down on his back knee to this full ball on middle and off. It was in the slot, and bang!"
8,"Agar to Mohammad Naim, no run shorter and quicker on middle and leg. Turns into him a touch, and is pushed to short fine leg"
9,"Agar to Mohammad Naim, no run good delivery. Extra bounce off this good length on off, which also turns into him. Defended safely in the end"

14,"Zampa to Mahedi Hasan, 1 run very full on off, and he pushes to midwicket. Quick run is gobbled, as the throw at the bowler's end misses the stumps"
15,"Zampa to Mohammad Naim, FOUR runs He cracks that over the bowler's head! Goes deep in his crease to this full ball outside off, and hammers it with mid-on inside the circle"
16,"Zampa to Mohammad Naim, 4 byes moves across, and the ball just about evades the leg stump. Full ball on middle, and this one turns into the batter, who goes for the sweep after exposing his middle and leg stump. The keeper is beaten as well, and the ball races away to fine leg for byes"

18,"Zampa to Mohammad Naim, 1 run tossed up and full on off. He is deep in his crease, and drives down to long-on"

20,"Ellis to Mohammad Naim, 1 run slower delivery first up. Short of a length on middle, and he waits for the ball to come before dabbing it toward square leg"
21,"Ellis to Mahedi Hasan, no run appeal for leg before, but turned down. Another slower ball, but this was much fuller on middle. Hits him on the front pad after good bounce off the surface. Replays suggest the bounce meant the ball would have gone over the stumps"

23,"Ellis to Mahedi Hasan, no run leading edge back to Ellis. Goes for the flick to this full ball on leg, and at 106kph only. Not in control of that"

31,"Turner to Mahedi Hasan, OUT top edge gobbled at midwicket! Shorter in length on middle, and the ball seemed like stopping on to the pitch as he went for the pull off his back foot. The bat entirely came out of his hands as he played that. Anyway, that is a wicket Turner will gladly accept after a couple of wides in the over"

33,"Turner to Shakib, 1 run backs away, and pushes this full ball on off to long-off"

36,"Ellis to Shakib, 1 run driven to deep point off this fullish length on off"
37,"Ellis to Mohammad Naim, no run the ball goes past his outside edge, and rolls down to the keeper. Very full on off, and he opens the bat face but the slower ball means it passes away from and also with relatively lower bounce"

40,"Ellis to Shakib, 1 run tucked toward square leg off the fullish length on middle and leg to end the powerplay. And it is a brilliant over from Ellis again"
41,"Christian to Shakib, no run goes wide of the crease to bowl full on off. It is a slower ball, and it is pushed back to the bowler"
42,"Christian to Shakib, 1 leg bye goes for the lap, but is beaten. Full ball on off from wide of the crease again. The ball trickles off his arm toward point, and they sneak in a leg bye"
43,"Christian to Mohammad Naim, no run short of a length on off, and cuts this straight to point on the bounce"

45,"Christian to Shakib, no run beaten off the slower ball. Good length delivery on middle and off, and he backs away to try and cut but can't get bat on ball"
46,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run just past the left of Christian, as the ball is pushed down to long-off. He bowled full on off, and went wide again to end up pretty wide of the crease. The ball just zipped past his hands on the left though"
47,"Swepson to Shakib, no run good length on middle and leg, and turns down leg. Clipped behind with the turn"
48,"Swepson to Shakib, 2 runs short of a length on middle, and he pulls to deep midwicket from deep in his crease"

51,"Swepson to Mohammad Naim, 2 runs this one turns away slightly off a good length on leg. Pushed to deep square, and a rapid two is gobbled"
52,"Swepson to Mohammad Naim, no run dabbed to short third man from close to his body, as Swepson goes shortish on off"
53,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run top edge lands in no man's land! Comes down the track to this good length ball on middle and leg, as the bowler follows him. Shakib pulls, but the ball lands just behind the stumps at the other end"
54,"Christian to Mohammad Naim, OUT taken at point! Goes for the reverse-sweep to this good length ball on off, but gets it off the higher part of the bat with his bottom hand coming off as well. Short third man thought for a moment that the ball was coming on to him and even took a few steps forward, but left it for the man at point in the end. Easy catch as well"
55,"Christian to Soumya, no run and beaten first ball. Wide of the crease, and a slower delivery on a fullish length outside off. Goes for the dab, but the ball passes his outside edge"

64,"Zampa to Soumya, 1 run full just outside off, and driven to long-off with the full face of the bat"
65,"Zampa to Shakib, OUT appeal for leg before, and the finger goes up! Shakib is dismisses leg before for the first time in T20Is. Full length on middle, and he closes his bat face pretty early to try and clip that to the leg side. But the ball zips through to strike his front pad, and the umpire calls him out after a brief thought"

81,"Swepson to Soumya, 1 run full at middle and leg, sweeps to deep square"

They bowled 12 overs of spin between four spinners, although the cutters and slower balls from Ellis and Christian were just as effective. Himanshu will be with you shortly"
129,"7.45pm Hello then. 33 without loss after the first three overs, yet Bangladesh end on just 122. But credit to Ellis and Christian, who have given Australia a chance to end the tour win two wins on the trot."
130,Out come the umpires and the Bangladesh side for the chase.
131,Wade and McDermott Christian take their time to come out of their hut though. A change in the opening combination for Australia too after the latter's assault of five sixes in an over last game.

154,"Nasum to Marsh, OUT struck on the front pad, and given leg before! But Marsh reviews. Good length ball on middle, and he is across the stumps while trying to slog that to the on side with his back leg way outside off. He his down on his back knee, as it hits him close to his knee. Replays show that would have hit middle and leg, and Marsh has to walk back. The stumps were clearly visible when"

172,"Saifuddin to Wade, 1 leg bye appeal for leg before, but that pitched outside leg on a fullish length. Wade goes for the slog behind square, but the ball strikes his back pad and rolls over"
