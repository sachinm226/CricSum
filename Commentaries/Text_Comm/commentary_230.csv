231,"Starc to Buttler, 1 leg bye slower ball outside leg, follows Buttler who had stepped away from his stumps. Hits his foot and bounces away towards point"
232,"Faulkner to Buttler, no run full, sliding away outside off. Buttler aims a reverse-sweep at it and misses"
233,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run down the track now, Faulkner shortens his length and bowls the slower ball. Pulled away towards deep midwicket"

235,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run full-toss on middle and off, slapped to mid-off"
236,"Faulkner to Bopara, 1 wide full and wide, another slower ball. Root swings and misses, and it's close enough to the tramline for the umpire to signal wide"
237,"Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run yorker on middle and off, clipped away to the right of mid-on"
238,"Faulkner to Buttler, FOUR runs full-toss on off stump, and finally a boundary. Clears his front leg and smacks it back down the ground, over the ducking umpire to bring up England's 300"
239,"Starc to Bopara, no run in the blockhole on off stump, and all Bopara can do is jab it back to the bowler"
240,"Starc to Bopara, 1 run Bopara's standing deep in his crease and he bowls it very full once again, on off stump, and he swipes it away towards mid-on and sets off for a single. Would have been run out if Smith's throw had hit the stumps at the bowler's end"
241,"Starc to Buttler, 1 run low full-toss on middle stump, poked away towards mid-off"

243,"Starc to Woakes, OUT another, and it's a run out this time. Length ball, swinging away from off stump. Woakes swings and misses and they try to sneak a bye. Haddin's throw knocks back middle stump, and Buttler is short of his crease despite putting in the dive"
244,"Starc to Broad, OUT and that's another run-out, is it? Yup, and Australia have a team hat-trick to finish the innings. Broad makes room and Starc spears in another yorker, just outside off. For some reason, Broad didn't even attempt a shot and they looked for another bye. Haddin rolled it into the base of the stumps, and Woakes was well short of his crease."
245,"6.00pm England were 244 for 2 at the end of the 40th over. Bell looked on course for a double century. But Sandhu's double strike in the 42nd over stalled their momentum, and Starc and Faulkner followed that up with some brilliant death bowling. Only 59 came off the last 10 overs, only 27 off the last five, and Australia are in with a real chance of winning this. It's still a 300-plus target, though,"
246,"Here's some reading material between innings: When he was a young and ferocious fast bowler, Len Pascoe wanted the batsmen to be afraid of him. But he also had his own fear. That he would hit someone too badly."

281,"Ali to Marsh, 1 run a bit of drift in towards middle stump, quite full, clipped to long-on"
282,"Finn to White, no run what a ball! That was angled in, towards a fourth-stump line, and it left White off the pitch. He poked at it without too much footwork and the ball beat his outside edge"
283,"Finn to Maxwell, no run back of a length outside off. Maxwell leaves it alone, lifting his bat ostentatiously over his head"
284,"Finn to Maxwell, 2 runs full inswinger, and Maxwell stands still and clips it in the air towards deep midwicket"
285,"Finn to Maxwell, 1 run dropped! Full and swinging in again, and Maxwell flicks uppishly, to the left of Anderson at short midwicket. It went quickly, and he dived full length and got his hand to it but couldn't hold on. Tough chance, that."

296,"Finn to Maxwell, no run back of a length on off stump, defended solidly to mid-off"

463,"Anderson to Smith, 2 runs slower ball, short ball, pulled round to deep square leg"
464,"Anderson to Smith, 1 run short, down the leg side, and he swivels around to pull it to long leg"
465,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run short ball, pulled down to deep backward square leg, and Smith has a century on captaincy debut in ODIs to go with his century on captaincy debut in Tests. What a player he is."
466,"Woakes to Haddin, no run slower ball outside off, and Haddin is beaten, through his pull shot too early"
467,"Woakes to Haddin, 1 wide Woakes throws a bit of a spanner into Haddin's fifty plans, spearing a wide down the leg side"

477,"Woakes to Henriques, no run length ball on off stump, pushed to short cover"
478,"Woakes to Henriques, no run down the track now and Woakes yorks Henriques, who can't get that drive past short cover. Smith was out of his crease at the other end and an accurate throw would have had him out"
479,"Woakes to Smith, 1 run full outside off and he shuffles across to flick it to deep midwicket and level the scores"
480,"Woakes to Starc, 1 run length ball on middle stump and he makes room to slap it away through the off side. Bounces over the fielder at cover, and that's the winning hit"
481,"10.13pm A bit of tension at the end, but how well did Smith control that chase? He made an exceptional century in a high-pressure chase against South Africa not too long ago, and this innings was just as good, if not better. Good support from Maxwell, Faulkner and Haddin as well. But England really lost the match when they were batting, in the last 10 overs of their innings. Ian Bell will wonder how"
482,"10.30pm That's all from us, from this highly entertaining game in Hobart. Australia have three wins out of three now, which means they are through to the final. England's defeat gives India a window of hope of reaching the final themselves. Make sure you join us for the next game, whenever that is (I'm pretty bad with itineraries). Until then, ta ta!"
