0,"Starc to Banton, no run back of a length and outside off, lets it go. Very T20 that, eh?"
1,"Starc to Banton, no run huge appeal for lbw as Starc gets an inswinger to thud into Banton's pads. His line is too straight though and the movement took it past the flick shot, and probably down leg side too"
2,"Starc to Banton, no run another maaaasssssive appeal and this one, I think, is much better. Ump says no, so Finch says review. Incredible bowling from Starc. Somewhere near his best. It's full. It's right at the stumps. It's swinging in very very late. But for all that menace, Banton is able to get an inside edge on there before it skids into his pads. Excellent spot by the on-field umpire Martin.Saggers"
3,"Starc to Banton, 1 run taps it to the left of mid-off and sprints through"
4,"Starc to Bairstow, 1 wide wanders way down leg and it's credit to Wade's prep behind the scenes that he's able to dive across and stop five wides."
5,"Starc to Bairstow, no run very full again, so much so that Bairstow doesn't even have to move his feet, just lean into the ball outside off and push into the covers"
6,"Starc to Bairstow, no run bouncer, and a sharp one at that, 91 mph on middle and leg. Bairstow spots it early enough and gets out of the way"
7,"Hazlewood to Banton, 1 run fullish on middle, nudges through the square leg region"
8,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run good length on middle, defends to cover"
9,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run flat bats a back of a length ball, hoping to send it soaring over the bowler's head. In the end, he only splices it to mid-off"
10,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run pulls through midwicket, even though he didn't have any room on offer. Bairstow is definitely going after Hazlewood here"
11,"Hazlewood to Banton, OUT caught behind!. Brilliant work from Hazlewood. Pitching it up. Inviting the drive. Batsmen in this format need no second invitation but Banton here finds that a little bit of away movement is enough to take his outside edge. As he walks back, he may even wonder if that was full enough to be going gung ho like that."
12,"Hazlewood to Malan, no run keeps it on a good length, gets the ball to nip in off the pitch, Malan manages an inside edge onto pad and searches for a single. His partner is too uncertain and they bail in the end"
13,"Starc to Bairstow, no run blocks a shortish ball on off stump"
14,"Starc to Bairstow, 3 runs sweetly hit down the ground, and it needs a last-ditch dive from Richardson to stop the ball from reaching the long-off boundary"
15,"Starc to Malan, no run back of a length on off stump, defends"
16,"Starc to Malan, FOUR runs outstanding shot!. It's just tailing into his pads, slightly short, but Malan picks it up so early and swivels on his back leg to pull it away to long leg."
17,"Starc to Malan, no run short of mid-on! Nearly bounces him out does Starc. Perhaps that was the plan the previous ball. Does it way better this time, getting the bouncer up towards his left shoulder. Malan goes for the pull again, but this time he's very slow on the shot, because the ball is coming for his head."
18,"Starc to Malan, 1 wide sliding down leg"
19,"Starc to Malan, 1 run drives outside off, one hand flying off the handle, as he finds third man"
20,"Hazlewood to Malan, no run shimmies down the pitch to hoick Hazlewood off his good line and length, no luck. The ball just pops off the pads into the off side"
21,"Hazlewood to Malan, no run swings hard and sends the back of a length ball to mid-on"
22,"Hazlewood to Malan, FOUR runs fine leg is up, he goes for the bouncer, Malan hooks it, gets a top edge and it leaps away to the fine leg boundary. Decent ball, just didn't have the field for it"
23,"Hazlewood to Malan, no run backs away to cut a ball aimed at middle and off stump, only for it to bounce over the top-edge. Hazlewood has one-upped the batsman very obviously coming after him over and over so far"
24,"Hazlewood to Malan, 1 run pushes gently to mid-on and sprints through"
25,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run picks up the short ball and pulls to deep square leg"
26,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, 2 runs pulls the back of a length ball to the left of deep square leg"
27,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, no run follows the batsman even as he clears his front leg and looks to go big. Back of a length ball, cramping him for room, makes him mistime to midwicket"
28,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, no run appeal for caught behind, not out says the ump immediately as Bairstow goes for a scoop and is beaten by a back of a length ball outside off stump. No review"
29,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, no run they go up again for another caught behind. Ump says no. Finch wants more info. He's not getting anything definitive except from the keeper who urges him to go. Bairstow was going for the pull here, when he doesn't quite have the room for the shot. He's beaten. No spike on UltraEdge. Australia lose all their reviews for the innings"
30,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, no run scuffs a pull shot to mid-on, trying to clear his front leg and crash the bowler out of the ground"
31,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, 2 runs short-arm pull past the left of short fine leg"
32,"Hazlewood to Malan, 1 run pulls a back of a length ball to deep square leg"
33,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run walks across to try and work a back of a length ball on off stump behind square leg. Gets struck on the pads, looks a bit high though. But Australia are gutted when the verdict is not out."
34,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, (no ball) jumps outside leg and is still unable to find the gap - and this was a full toss too. Ooooh, hello. This is a no-ball. He's overstepped and the third ump's spotted it"
35,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs inside edges a hoick and the low full toss on middle scurries away to the fine leg boundary. Well, that's one way to get going."
36,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs hammers it away to the deep square leg boundary. Finally one of his wild swings to the leg side hits the middle of the bat. Mysteriously enough, it's the one time he's not been moving around mad in his crease. Just a stable base to draw power from."
37,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run struck on the pad as he tries to flick into midwicket."
38,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run drives to mid-on"
39,"Kane Richardson to Malan, 1 run dabs the shortish ball to the left of short third man, where Hazlewood dives to stop a boundary"
40,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, 2 runs punches through cover, to the left of the sweeper, again with plenty of power once he decides to play normal cricket"
41,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, 1 run walks across to cut a short ball to the sweeper"
42,"Kane Richardson to Malan, 1 run whips a length ball through midwicket"
43,"Kane Richardson to Bairstow, 1 run slower ball outside off, Bairstow adjusts well enough in the end to guide it to short third man"
44,"Kane Richardson to Malan, 1 run slogs a length ball, looking to go over long-on, but it's off pace again. And he's so far into his shot that he scuffs it along the ground to long-on"
45,"Agar to Malan, 2 runs sweeps between deeps square leg and midwicket, but Hazlewood there tracks the ball well and tennis fore-hands it back into the field of play as he himself goes over it."
46,"Agar to Malan, FOUR runs reverse sweep past point. Outstanding pick up from Malan. The ball is on a length, allowing him to get under it and power away."
47,"Agar to Malan, 1 run goes back and pushes a good length ball to deep midwicket"
48,"Agar to Bairstow, no run cuts to short third man"
49,"Agar to Bairstow, FOUR runs cuts again and this time he picks the gap between point and short third man. Not without some degree of risk though - the ball went at catchable height."
50,"Agar to Bairstow, 2 runs punches through point"
51,"Zampa to Malan, OUT taken at deep midwicket! Lovely work from Stoinis, running in off the boundary, diving forward and picking up an important low catch. Just reward for Zampa who sensed Malan would go for his favourite sweep shot, held his length back, added a few extra revs to get the extra bounce that then gets the top edge. Good stuff."
52,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run turns a fuller delivery on leg stump through square leg"
53,"Zampa to Billings, 1 run squeezes a drive to the left of backward point"
54,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run goes back to the flatter ball and flicks to the left of deep midwicket"
55,"Zampa to Billings, 1 run googly, on middle, Billings goes back and works it through midwicket"
56,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run backs away to punch the shortish ball on off stump to the left of cover"
57,"Agar to Bairstow, no run goes for the slog sweep, but the ball drifts into him, and dips at the last second to sneak under his bat"
58,"Agar to Bairstow, 2 runs nudges a full ball on leg stump to the left of short fine leg"
59,"Agar to Bairstow, SIX runs steps out, turns a length ball into a half-volley and launches it all the way over long-on. Monster hit. Simply done."
60,"Agar to Bairstow, no run pulls his length back and Bairstow cuts to cover"
61,"Agar to Bairstow, 1 run drives to long-on"
62,"Agar to Billings, 2 runs defends a full ball towards midwicket for a double."
63,"Zampa to Bairstow, SIX runs and heeeeeerrrrre's Jonny! Brutalised over deep square! Bairstow honks a mahoosive slog-sweep into the empty stands... that's an obscene hit"
64,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run pushed through flat outside off, dabbed for one"
65,"Zampa to Billings, OUT tossed up, Billings reverses... gloved to slip! Zampa gets another, bit of turn and bounce and Billings' attempt to funk it through point ends up plopping a catch to Finch! Extra flight and dip for Zampa, and he gets the reward for keeping a slip in. So Billings misses out on his chance to impress"
66,"Zampa to Ali, no run floated up from over the wicket, Moeen waits on it and taps back defensively"
67,"Zampa to Ali, 1 run flighted, slightly wider and he punches through cover point"
68,"Zampa to Bairstow, no run quicker, outside off and YJB drill to cover... excellent comeback in that over from Zampsta"
69,"Hazlewood to Ali, no run bangs a length on off, tapped into the covers"
70,"Hazlewood to Ali, no run touch shorter, 85mph/137kph and Moeen drops it down into the off side, no chance of a quick one as the field comes in"
71,"Hazlewood to Ali, 1 run bit of width, this time he hangs back and glides to third man"
72,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 leg bye fired in straight, 84mph/136kph and deflected behind square on the leg side"
73,"Hazlewood to Ali, FOUR runs ramped for four! Cute stuff from Moeen, sits back and uses the pace, sends it fine of third man"
74,"Hazlewood to Ali, no run dug in short, 84mph at the sternum and this results in some evasive action... decent showing from Hazlewood tonight"
75,"Zampa to Bairstow, no run looped up on off, prodded away"
76,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run straighter, this one the Bosie and Bairstow is down to slog-sweep, gets a thick inside edge through backward square leg"
77,"Zampa to Ali, 1 run comes down, drilled to long-off, struck that powerfully but scudded low to the man set back"
78,"Zampa to Bairstow, SIX runs blootered! YJB steps down and kabooms this over long-off! Bouncing into the empty seats, that is fifty for Bairstow... First in six T20I innings, reward for battling through"
79,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up on the stumps and he sweeps in orthodox fashion for one"
80,"Zampa to Ali, no run pushed through and Moeen taps away on leg stump"
81,"Agar to Bairstow, 1 run flat and fast outside off, mistimed on the cut as he drops back and cover sweeps it up"
82,"Agar to Ali, 1 leg bye length ball, Moeen swings for the hills, misses and the balls thuds into the back leg... pitched outside leg? He'd also come a long way down"
83,"Agar to Bairstow, OUT slogs leg side, top-edged towards the ring... and Agar hunts it down for the c&b! He's struggled for timing, despite scoring a crunchy fifty, and Bairstow won't be going on tonight. Excellent running catch from Agar, with the ball looping towards no man's land"
84,"Agar to Ali, no run dragged down but Moeen swats it back towards the bowler, who cuts it off to his left"
85,"Agar to Ali, no run attempts to come down, Agar spears it leg side and Moeen manages to get something in the way"
86,"Agar to Ali, FOUR runs sliced off the back foot, using the pace from Agar, Zampa scrambles across from short third man... can't prevent it from running away! Moeen picks up four from the last ball of an otherwise decent over"
87,"Zampa to Denly, no run flighted legbreak, spinning on middle and leg, Denly blocks it half forward"
88,"Zampa to Denly, 1 run flatter and he's back on off stump to cut one to the deep point sweeper"
89,"Zampa to Ali, SIX runs Mo mows, straight back down the ground! Skipped out and hooned this into the sight screen for a flat six"
90,"Zampa to Ali, 1 run fired in quick and he flicks off the pads coming forward"
91,"Zampa to Denly, no run Denly tries to use the feet, Zampa slows his pace up, the googly nearly sneaks through between bat and pad... just manages to keep it out, otherwise he was in stumping country"
92,"Zampa to Denly, FOUR runs slap-sliced up and over, gets it away to the rope at deep extra cover! Not a clean strike from Denly but he got just about enough on it"
93,"Agar to Ali, 1 run flat outside off from round the wicket and Moeen cuts for one"
94,"Agar to Denly, 1 run tossed up, Denly is forward and lofting over point for a single"
95,"Agar to Ali, 1 run shortish on leg stump, Moeen hoicks through the leg side, only a single to the boundary rider"
96,"Agar to Denly, no run fired in quick, 65mph and bouncing over the top of leg stump as Denly makes room trying to cut!"
97,"Agar to Denly, 1 run quick and flat and he gets this one away off the back foot through point"
98,"Agar to Ali, 2 runs tossed up and Moeen opens up, chips down the ground, clears the bowler and long-off has to come around"
99,"Starc to Denly, 1 run round the wicket, full and wide of the stumps and squirted through backward point"
100,"Starc to Ali, no run over the wicket, length ball and it wobbles back in towards off stump as Moeen thrashes at it and misses"
101,"Starc to Ali, 1 run fired full on leg stump, 93mph/149kph and Moeen clips it away towards deep midwicket for one"
102,"Starc to Denly, 1 run round the wicket, again, 91mph/147kph and drilled down the ground to long-on"
103,"Starc to Ali, OUT swung high into the leg side, Smith is under it at deep midwicket... taken on rope despite a juggle! Or was it? The TV umpire is going to take a long look at this. Smith was very close as he took catch, his heel right on the boundary marker, and did it just touch? He then tossed the ball up and walked in to catch it a second time, just to be sure. But there's no conclusive evidence and after"
104,"Starc to Denly, 1 run fired in full at 90+ mph again, dug out into the covers for one"
105,"Kane Richardson to Denly, 2 runs short, pace off the ball, Denly has to reach for the pull and does well to pick up two into the leg side"
106,"Kane Richardson to Denly, FOUR runs chopped past his stumps! Makes room for a back-foot hack and beats Wade's dive to pick up four!"
107,"Kane Richardson to Denly, FOUR runs edged wide of the keeper this time, but played in deliberate fashion to another slower ball! Nicely done, back-to-back fours for Denly"
108,"Kane Richardson to Denly, FOUR runs pace off, wide of the stumps, sliced past Wade for four more! Don't think he was really aiming there on this occasion, tried a forcing short but got it between keeper and short third man again"
109,"Kane Richardson to Denly, 1 run pitched up, 88mph/141kph and he bunts this into the covers"
110,"Kane Richardson to Jordan, 1 run pitched up on the stumps, pace on again, 88mph and Jordan inside-edges to fine leg"
111,"Starc to Jordan, no run back of a length from round the wicket, 88mph/141kph and jabbed down into the off side, Starc lopes after it"
112,"Starc to Jordan, 1 run full, 90mph/145kph and Jordan lifts it up and over cover point to the sweeper"
113,"Starc to Denly, 1 run full and straight at 91mph/147kph, bunted down to long-on, only a single there"
114,"Starc to Jordan, 1 run cranking it up, 92mph/148kph yorker, slightly leg side and Jordan can only dig it out towards midwicket... Starc again hurtles after it in his follow through to keep them to a single"
115,"Starc to Denly, 1 run sconed him! Short and nasty, clonked right on the top of the lid before rebounding to point on the bounce! Denly stepped away leg side, Starc followed him with a fearsome bouncer, took a bit of glove on the way on to his helmet, I think... there'll be a short delay while he gets checked out"
116,"Starc to Jordan, 1 run full and fast on off stump, Jordan swipes it towards mid-off and they scamper one... Just five off the over, giving Starc excellent figures of 1 for 20"
117,"Kane Richardson to Jordan, OUT Jordan holes out to long-on! No pace on the ball from Richardson, swatted hard down the ground as Jordan hung back, but Smith is there, running around to take a comfortable catch"
118,"Kane Richardson to Denly, 1 run pace on, right up in the blockhole and Denly carves it away to midwicket for one"
119,"Kane Richardson to Tom Curran, 1 run short of a length, 79mph/127kph and Curran swings a pull to deep midwicket"
120,"Kane Richardson to Denly, 1 run full and wide, slower ball again and Denly is down on one knee, plinks a drive to extra cover"
121,"Kane Richardson to Tom Curran, no run cutter on the pads, gets away with this as Curran swings and it flicks the pad on the way down the leg side"
122,"Kane Richardson to Tom Curran, 1 run good ball to finish, hits a length and Curran can only swat it towards mid-off for a single to finish - meaning Australia will need 146 to win and retain their No. 1 ranking"
123,"7.40pm: Well, that was a bit of a laboured slog from England. Couple of excellent overs at the death prevented them from getting any closer to 150... but this might still be a tricky chase, given the slowness of the surface. Jonny Bairstow's 55 from 44 was rarely fluent, while Joe Denly poked and swung his way to 29 from 19 in the face of an impressive performance from Australia's five-man attack, Mitchell Starc and"
124,"Right then, here we go. Australia will want to get this right and that means going well early. Finch and Wade at the crease."
125,"Archer to Wade, 1 run 92.7 mph, cramps him with a shortish ball at the body, he works it away to long leg"
126,"Archer to Finch, FOUR runs picks up the short ball and launches it away to the deep square leg boundary. Outstanding shot. Saw it so early"
127,"Archer to Finch, 1 run"
128,"Archer to Wade, FOUR runs a little glove and even that little, at this pace, is enough to run away to the boundary behind the keeper. Pull shot to a short ball at the body and no matter the mis-hit, it runs away"
129,"Archer to Wade, no run smashes it down the ground and would have been four too had it not thudded right into his partner Finch at the non-strikers' end."
130,"Archer to Wade, SIX runs picks it up and swipes it away over deep square leg, and it's been hit so well its gone into the signage, towering over the very back of the stands. What a shot. What a pick up. What a way to start the innings off. 91m six."
131,"Wood to Finch, 1 run low full toss tailing into Finch, who is just about able to flick it through square leg"
132,"Wood to Wade, 1 run drives down the ground to mid-on"
133,"Wood to Finch, no run blocks a fast one on middle stump. 148 kph from Wood"
134,"Wood to Finch, no run defends a good length ball at 143 kph on off stump. Finch is staying back, waiting for the short one, so he can't readily attack these deliveries. His balance is all wrong for that."
135,"Wood to Finch, no run looks to power a fuller ball on leg stump, at 149 kph, but it's mistimed to mid-on"
136,"Wood to Finch, FOUR runs a touch too full and a little too leg side and Finch is able to whip it over midwicket and into the boundary. That should feel good for the Australia captain. He was hoping the ball would come onto the bat under lights."
137,"Archer to Wade, 1 run works a 151 kph delivery on leg stump away to long leg"
138,"Archer to Finch, 1 run legcutter that, bringing his pace down from 95 mph to 79mph. Finch taps it through the covers"
139,"Archer to Wade, no run walks across his stumps and misses a 93 mph low full toss outside off. Wade's not too thrilled with that."
140,"Archer to Wade, 1 run pulls a back of a length ball at 80 mph to midwicket. Moeen's there, diving to his right to try and get underneath the ball to pull off the catch. But it bounces too early, giving him no chance"
141,"Archer to Finch, SIX runs 89 mph short ball takes a top edge (off a pull shot) and sails away for six. Archer stares at it in disbelief. He had the batsman beat. For pace. For bounce. For everything. And yet it's six against his name with fine leg up"
142,"Archer to Finch, no run legcutter at 80mph that flicks the pad through to the keeper"
143,"Wood to Stoinis, no run 93mph, back of a length on of stump, defemds."
144,"Wood to Stoinis, no run 90mph, drives the full ball to cover"
145,"Wood to Stoinis, no run leans back and cuts an 89 mph delivery to point. Hoped to beat him on his left, but couldn't"
146,"Wood to Stoinis, 1 wide bouncer that goes a little down leg. Might have been bouncing too high too, Whatever the case, this 88 mph ball is a wide"
147,"Wood to Stoinis, no run 90mph, shortish on off stump, blocks it."
148,"Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs launches it over the top of the bowler's head. It's 94 mph, but it's length and Stoinis wades into it, his front foot going towards the line of the ball and those strong shoulders power right through the line."
149,"Jordan to Finch, 1 run cuts the back of a length ball away to the sweeper"
150,"Jordan to Stoinis, no run blocks an 84 kph delivery on off stump into the covers"
151,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs muscles it way. It isn't all that short. It is on off stump. Not too many people would consider that a bad ball. But Stoinis does and he pulls it to the deep midwicket boundary"
152,"Jordan to Stoinis, 2 runs lifts it over mid-off, just about. Archer is the man running back and to his left, reaching out for it, but he couldn't get there. Stoinis survives after splicing a length ball that he really should have put into orbit"
153,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs thunderous strike! Half-volley gets the treatment as Stoinis gets under it and powers away an on-drive. That's a non-striker killer. Good thing Finch was somewhere near the grass as he was backing up"
154,"Jordan to Stoinis, 1 run picks the slower ball and swivel pulls it to long leg"
155,"Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs hits it right through point! He doesn't have room to free the arms, but he's clearly seeing it better than anyone else out there. Sways his body out of the way and carves it so powerfully it goes right through Banton"
156,"Wood to Stoinis, no run back of a length ball on middle and off, defends"
157,"Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs picks up the bouncer, even though it's 91 mph, and pulls it over short fine leg. He's loving this extra pace."
158,"Wood to Stoinis, no run blocks a shortish delivery into the covers"
159,"Wood to Stoinis, 1 run pushes a good length ball to mid-off"
160,"Wood to Finch, FOUR runs pierces the gap to the left of cover point, Denly unable to stop a sweetly timed punch from Finch. Australia would have wanted a Powerplay like this so dearly at the break. Now that they have it, will they be able to see this chase through?"
161,"Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run steps out of his crease, prompting Rashid to pull his length back and drag his line wide. Stoinis adjusts and drives along the ground to long-off"
162,"Rashid to Finch, FOUR runs rocks back and cuts strongly between the sweeper and long-off. That's another top shot from the Australian captain. And this one is off a slower bowler, who should be a huge threat on this pitch"
163,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run out the front of the hand this time, Finch backs away and cuts to the sweeper"
164,"Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run defends a good length ball outside off. Gets an outside edge to point"
165,"Rashid to Finch, no run dropped And it's a dolly too! Poor Jonny Bairstow. And he'll feel the sting of an audible awwww from Rashid, who was tracking the ball too. The legspinner had secured a mis-hit, with a loopy legbreak that made Finch hit across the line. The sweep shot gets the top edge thanks to some dip and turn. It should have been a straightforward wicket. But..."
166,"Rashid to Finch, 2 runs"
167,"Tom Curran to Finch, 1 run nudges a good length ball into midwicket. Maxwell, the new bat, is in trouble, a direct hit from Billings might have had him!"
168,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run defends a back of a length ball on off stump"
169,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run good length on off stump, defends. Another back of the hand slower ball, btw."
170,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run stops on the pitch, making him chip a drive over the infield and to the sweeper. Another sign that slower balls are the way to go here"
171,"Tom Curran to Finch, 1 run taps a back of a length ball through the covers"
172,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run picks the legbreak and carves it away to the sweeper"
173,"Rashid to Maxwell, 1 run drives the tossed up ball to the left of long-off"
174,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run lashes it to the sweeper again"
175,"Rashid to Maxwell, 1 run walks across his crease, waiting for the wrong 'un to turn and then flicking it behind square leg"
176,"Rashid to Finch, 2 runs sweeps at a googly, gets a top edge which evades short fine leg running to his left. Wood really did have no chance there."
177,"Rashid to Finch, no run misses a wide full toss. He just misses it."
178,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 2 runs pulls a short ball to the left of short midwwicket."
179,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run bouncer outside off, Maxwell thinks about dragging it leg side, but then ignores it in the end"
180,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run punches a shortish delivery on off stump to short cover"
181,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run nudges a length ball to the left of midwicket"
182,"Tom Curran to Finch, 2 runs works a shortish slower ball into the midwicket region and since everyone there is in the deep, they pinch two"
183,"Tom Curran to Finch, 2 runs cuts the back of a length ball to the sweeper. They get through for a second again - a risky second. A better throw would have been tight."
184,"Rashid to Maxwell, no run full and flighted, outside off and Maxwell attempts to reverse-sweep, sends it to slip on the bounce"
185,"Rashid to Finch, no run floated up and tapped into the covers"
186,"Rashid to Finch, 1 wide slider down the leg side, Finch sweeps at it and Bairstow bellows out an insistent appeal! Not given, umpire Saggers signals wide, but England review. Did Finch catch up with it on the way past? No, says the technology! Very close but he didn't get anything on it"
187,"Rashid to Marsh, 2 runs pushes through the straighter one, Marsh is back and flicks leg side, they come back for two as deep midwicket comes in"
188,"Rashid to Marsh, no run tosses up another wrong'un wide of off stump, mistimed on the drive into the covers"
189,"Denly to Smith, 1 run tossed up, legbreak on middle and leg, swatted own the ground to long-on"
190,"Denly to Marsh, FOUR runs edged through Malan's hands at slip! Forcing shot off the back foot and Marsh steered it to the right of Malan, who couldn't quite get his paws up in time! Runs away to third man for four, too"
