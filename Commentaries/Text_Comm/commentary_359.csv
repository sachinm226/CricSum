210,"Anderson to Harris, 2 runs solid drive, really solid straight drive from Harris that is almost a low return chance to Anderson, but he was never really going to get it.

227,"Root to Haddin, 1 run stays back and nudges to midwicket, there's a note of panic in the call and Bell's throw isn't far from causing Johnson a mischief but they get the single and Brad Haddin goes to fifty in his 50th Test"

255,"Swann to Johnson, no run flighted on the pads, Johnson bunts it away, happy to wait for his fifty"
256,"Swann to Johnson, no run he wants the single now, nudges one to square leg and takes off but is turned back, nearly slips over on the pitch but all's well that ends well"
257,"Swann to Johnson, no run a little shorter from Swann but Johnson's cut can't find the gap"
258,"Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs that is the fifty for Mitchell Johnson, and quite a way to bring it up, he has just lofted this beautifully over cover, a well-controlled shot really and it bounces safely away for four"
259,"Swann to Johnson, 3 runs rocks back to a shorter ball and adds more runs now as he cuts this behind point"
260,"Broad to Haddin, no run backs away to leg, doesn't make contact as he aims through the off side again"
261,"Broad to Haddin, 1 run fuller outside off, inside edge into his pad and it bobbles towards the slips...happy to expose Lyon"

263,"Broad to Haddin, 1 run short of a length, dropped square of the wicket into the off side"
264,"Broad to Lyon, no run short of a length, Lyon doesn't have a problem blocking this to the off side"

277,"Broad to Lyon, no run that's an excellent short ball, 85mph/136kph, and Lyon flinches as he gets out of the line"
278,"Anderson to Haddin, 1 run, OUT he's gone! Excellent from Carberry. Haddin jabbed a full ball into the off side and wanted two, but he never had a chance once Carberry picked up the ball cleanly running in from deep point. It was an okay throw, a slightly awkward take from Prior who did very well to get the ball down onto the"
279,"The England openers race off straight away, followed by the rest, and Broad raises the ball to the crowd again. A few more boos. It has been a superb performance from him. England will be delighted to keep Australia under 300, although 295 is a few more than looked likely at 132 for 6. Now it's all about the new ball again. Harris,"
280,"The Australians coming back out. Cook and Carberry will follow shortly. Huge moment for Carberry, his second, belated chance at Test cricket. This should be a testing period up to lunch."
281,Ryan Harris with the first over. So we have to wait for Mitchell...
282,"Harris to Cook, 1 leg bye short of a length on leg stump, glances off Cook's thigh pad down to fine leg"
283,"Harris to Carberry, 2 runs he's off the mark neatly with a clip through the leg side, was a length delivery around middle and leg, that will calm him down"
284,"Harris to Carberry, 2 runs full at off stump, hint of swing back in, but it's meant with a solid punch straight down the ground, bounces into the hard pitch then bisects mid-on and mid-off"

299,"Harris to Carberry, no run on off stump, defended to cover, to end a steady maiden"
300,"Johnson to Cook, no run on a length outside off, defended to the cover...Johnson has some stunning facial hair going on at the moment (that, obviously, has nothing to do with the actual delivery)"
301,"Johnson to Cook, no run a little fuller this time, Cook's stride isn't very big as he defends to the off side"
302,"Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs on leg stump, clipped very fine past the keeper for the first boundary of the innings...wonder if Clarke will consider a leg slip?"
303,"Johnson to Cook, no run goes for the yorker, comes out a low full toss, Cook bunts it to mid-on"
304,"Johnson to Cook, no run that's a good line and length, on off stump, Cook defends and it runs off the outside edge towards gully"

314,"Johnson to Carberry, no run on the stumps, tapped defensively down towards leg"
315,"Johnson to Carberry, no run woof, that's some MJ magic right there, signs of that mercurial swing as the ball curves late away from the batsman, who wasn't forward and poked in vain - not far off getting a snick on it"
316,"Johnson to Carberry, no run dug in short and this sails down the leg side, no shot offered"
317,"Johnson to Carberry, FOUR runs width, Carberry flashes hard and the ball flies off the outer half of the bat, it flew over the cordon, I think, but there were plenty of juice in it, deliberately played and the ball zips to the rope"

326,"Siddle to Carberry, no run on the stumps, comes forward to defend"

342,"Harris to Cook, no run outside off, pushed through and left alone"
343,"Harris to Cook, OUT probing outside off, Cook is drawn into playing and there's a visible deflection through to Haddin - Australia have the breakthrough they needed! Harris, into his sixth over, has been immaculate as ever and he gets Cook again, reward for his persistence. The delivery maybe nibbled away a touch off the sea"

360,"Johnson to Carberry, FOUR runs straighter line, short and at the ribs and Carberry fends it round the corner, it's not miles away form being a chance to Haddin but the ball skips away to the fine-leg boundary"
361,"Johnson to Carberry, no run short and sharp, causing the batsman to flinch out of the way - that was 91mph/145kph"

371,"Johnson to Trott, no run and whammo! hit on the gloves first ball fending at a skiddy bumper, Johnson has a glare on, staring down the wicket, after Trott awkwardly hopped back and thrust his hands up in front of his face - did well to keep it down"
372,"Johnson to Trott, 3 runs shortish and at the body again, Trott plays this well, going across his stumps and flicking the ball high over backward square, they pick up three"
373,"Johnson to Carberry, 1 run drifts towards the leg side again, nudged round the corner for one more"
374,"Johnson to Trott, no run dug in, Trott's block is on the chopper again, he ducks and weaves out of the way"
375,"Johnson to Trott, 2 runs Trott plays this well enough, keeping on top of the bounce and paddling a couple through square leg - that posts the England fifty, too"

382,"Siddle to Carberry, no run length delivery, another calm leave from Carberry"
383,"Johnson to Trott, OUT short and down the leg side, Trott plays away from his body and Haddin goes up in celebration - they've got him, Johnson has done it, on the stroke of lunch! Just as England did yesterday, Australia have plucked out the No. 3 just as the napkins were being laid out. Clarke in the slips wasn't sure but H"

402,"Siddle to Carberry, no run closer to off stump, but Carberry can still leave it alone"

485,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run pushed across, looking to induce a moment's indecision - and indiscretion - outside off, but Bell dabs the ball daintily into the covers and steals a base"
486,"Johnson to Carberry, no run fullish, wide of the stumps and ignored by the batsman"
487,"Johnson to Carberry, no run lovely ball from Johnson, full and swerving late past the outside edge, Carberry drew his bat inside but he'd already been beaten"

495,"Lyon to Bell, no run floated up around off stump, Bell gets in line to tap back down the track"
496,"Johnson to Carberry, no run thudded in short and the ball deflects away, behind short leg, who scrambles in pursuit - looks like it careened into Carberry's ribs, rather than took the glove"
497,"Johnson to Carberry, no run another bumper, this time Carberry takes it on ... but hooks and misses at a sharply rising ball"
498,"Johnson to Carberry, OUT short, speared across and takes the edge, he's gone, Johnson does it again! Superbly planned and executed by Australia, Carberry was clearly discomfited by that line of attack, Johnson beating out a tattoo of short deliveries that rose towards the ribcage, this slid across and although he tried to wi"
499,"Johnson to Root, no run the field was set for another short ball, Johnson going back over the wicket, but it was instead full, Root dropped the bat and was only a whisker from getting something on it, sound of bat on ground, I think"

The Gabba's grisly magi"
504,"Lyon to Prior, OUT and is that another? Prior lobs the ball to short leg - or does he? Smith took it again at short leg, throwing himself to his right, but Dar wasn't convinced. Australia review after a brief discussion and it looks like a brilliant decision, as replays show the ball coming off the inside edge on to pad. Sup"
505,"Lyon to Broad, no run tossed up, very wide off the stumps and Broad gratefully watches it spin and spit further away from him"

510,"Johnson to Root, no run shorter, goes back and defends from the crease"
511,"Johnson to Root, OUT full and wide, Root drives, huge edge and another one falls! England are in tatters, seven down, all their batsmen back in the coop! What was Root doing there?! It was pitched up, leaving him and he threw the bat, a loose drive, steering the ball into the midriff of third slip, Smith again. Australia in"

520,"Johnson to Swann, no run back of a length, the cordon watches greedily, Swann edges away"
521,"Johnson to Swann, no run banged in, down the leg side, this time he ducks"
522,"Johnson to Swann, OUT gone! Amazing, incredible scenes at the Gabba, England eight down! This is becoming a collapse for the ages, Swann the latest to be swallowed up, Johnson again the tormentor. He was hanging back for the short ball, this was on a length, on leg stump, he wasn't forward and an inside edge ballooned off th"

524,"Johnson to Tremlett, no run fired across again, slightly back of a length, Tremlett shoulders arms again"

531,"Lyon to Tremlett, no run tossed up, goes back and defends in front of off stump - and that, incredibly, brings us to tea, with England clinging on by a thread"

536,"Johnson to Tremlett, no run that's short and quick, clears Tremlett's head by a long way which is quite some effort"
537,"Johnson to Tremlett, no run short of a length, Tremlett not completely in line as it fizzes past the outside edge. Wonderful stuff from Johnson. A epic spell"

548,"Johnson to Broad, no run he's taken a blow! Fierce delivery. Takes him on the back of the helmet, although the ball brushed the wrist first. This is hostile"

594,"What an innings that was. At 82 for 2 it seemed pretty steady, then the hostile brilliance of Johnson, the canny spin of Lyon, the smart captaincy of Clarke and some batting that verged in the inept at times has led to this. Australia lead by 159 and there are 25 overs, light permitting, left today. Will be interesting to see who E"
