510,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run they have called for a review here, Maxwell moved right across his stumps and it was a yorker heading to leg stump which glanced the boot as it went through to de Kock. Ah, it actually glanced the pad and is missing another set of stumps. But it's a dot ball"

516,"Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run excellent delivery, gets the yorker in at off stump, all Maxwell can do is squirt it to backward point"

525,"Rabada to Maxwell, 2 runs moves over the off side, picks up a length delivery and pulls towards fine leg, a very good tumbling save on the boundary from Ngidi. His knee caught in the turf which is worrying, hope he's okay"
526,"Rabada to Maxwell, 1 wide follows him with a short ball as he moves to the leg side, it's too short"
527,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run beaten this time, gives himself too much to the leg side, Rabada keeps it full outside off"

531,"Ngidi to Cummins, 1 run full outside off, drives firmly but straight to mid-off inside the circle"

545,"So the series win to South Africa and they deserved it. A few things for Australia to take with them in their rebuilding, but they have a distance to go in one-day cricket. They won't play 50 overs again until January against India as they switch back to T20 mode before the Tests. There is a one-off T20 between these two sides on Saturday and we'll be back to bring you the acti"
546,We'll bring you the presentation shortly...
547,"South Africa win by 40 runs and take the series 2-1. A very fine performance today, highlighted by that huge stand between Faf du Plessis and David Miller then some outstanding death bowling. Dale Steyn to the fore again. Australia threatened for a while through Shaun Marsh's hundred and some strong hitting by Marcus Stoinis, but their poor start had left them a lot to do."
548,South Africa won by 40 runs
549,"Player of the match is David Miller, SA"
