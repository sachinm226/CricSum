0,"Starc to Shehzad, 1 run short of a length, just outside off, runs it down to third man to get off the mark right away"
1,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run Sarfraz is not walking down the wicket to Starc here. Stays in the crease to defend a length ball"
2,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run he moves back into the crease but the intent is positive. Drives at a length ball, Smith at cover-point makes a diving save"
3,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run this one swings. Sarfraz, who has walked down to Philander, Steyn etc. so far, is caught with his feet stuck. This one swings a touch back in from outside off. He pushes away from the body. Beaten on the inside edge. Off stump stays safe"
4,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run bouncer, 150ks already, he ducks it"
5,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run wide length ball, driven on the up, but straight to Smith at cover-point"

8,"Hazlewood to Shehzad, 1 run short of a length, outside off, opens the face for a single"
9,"Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run Sarf walks down this time. Hazlewood digs it in. He has to defend off the back foot"
10,"Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 4 leg byes too straight. Sarf is down the wicket again, Hazlewood strays down the pads, and kisses the pad on the way for four leg-byes"
11,"Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, seams away from just outside off, Sarf wafts at it, and is beaten"
12,"Starc to Shehzad, no run lovely delivery. Looks like it will swing back in, pitches just outside off, and then seams away to beat the outside edge"
13,"Starc to Shehzad, 1 run goes for the yorker already, ends up bowling a low full toss at 150ks, the ball runs off the outside half of the bat for one"
14,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, middle and leg, defended to midwicket. 149ks this time"
15,"Starc to Sarfaraz, 2 runs on the pads this time, and Sarfraz is off the mark with a clip fine of long leg"
16,"Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 run digs this one in short, Sarf goes tall, cuts this to third man for one"
17,"Starc to Shehzad, 2 runs nicely played. Shehzad upper-cuts this short ball. Deliberately so, to miss the man at backward point. Not much power behind the shot, just the guiding over the head of the fielder. Gets a couple"
18,"Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 1 run walks down the pitch, moves across too, pushes a length ball to third man for one"
19,"Hazlewood to Shehzad, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"

23,"Hazlewood to Shehzad, no run on a length, good bounce, hits the bat hard. Defended to mid-on"
24,"Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 wide angled across him. Left alone. Called a wide although that doesn't look like one to me"
25,"Starc to Sarfaraz, 2 runs driven on the up. This is a length ball outside off, doesn't swing, and he punches it past cover, to his right"
26,"Starc to Sarfaraz, no run lovely crunchy punch outside off, but straight to cover-point"
27,"Starc to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs short of a length, middle and leg, there is no room to swing his arms, but he has somehow short-arm-pulled it past square leg for four. Starc has bowled at 150ks. All that pace has been used here"
28,"Starc to Sarfaraz, OUT say what you will of Watson's batting, he is one of the best slip fielders in the world today. This catch is one for the ages. Slip catches are never easy, but the ones that swerve away from you at the last moment? That too to balls bowled at 150.1ks? Sarfraz just follows this quick length ball with his hands, edges it, looks like he has offered an easy catch to Watto until the ball swings away from him at the last moment. Wa"
29,"Starc to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs what a way to start your innings in the quarter-final. You have just lost out your matchwinner from the two previous matches in the fifth over, your side is notorious for not batting well, what do you do? You walk out and drive the first ball you face on the up, you drive it so hard, it bounces over the fielder at point"
30,"Starc to Haris Sohail, no run bouncer, at 147ks, ducks it"
31,"Hazlewood to Shehzad, OUT Pakistan openers are back in the sheds already. Plays a loose shot to a wide length ball. Away from the body with no foot movement. The only thing that moves is the ball. Slightly away from him. Takes a thick edge to the second slip where Clarke takes it easily"
32,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run left alone outside off"
33,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run the bail doesn't come off, but they are also reviewing the lbw. They are not allowing the review, which is just as well for Australia. This is down the leg side, clips the thigh pad, comes back onto the stumps, clips the leg stump, the bail budges, flashes, but comes back down because it is heavier than usual bails. Clarke looks like he wants to review the lbw because he thinks this has hit the pad normally and not the i"

49,"Hazlewood to Haris Sohail, no run half-volley, driven hard, but straight to cover"
50,"Johnson to Misbah, FOUR runs and immediately a false shot. Misbah's mind wants to drive at this full wide ball, but the body hasn't followed. Feet are stuck, the hands don't quite go, but he gets an inside edge to fine leg"
51,"Johnson to Misbah, no run full and straight, driven to mid-on"
52,"Johnson to Misbah, 1 run pushed into the leg side for a single"

57,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run shuffles across again, covers the outswing, defends to cover"
58,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run this one moves back in exposing the dangers of the movement across. Seams back in from just outside off, but it is bouncing over the stumps. Seems to have rapped him between the unprotected part between the pad and the thigh pad"
59,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run bouncer, outside off, he ducks it"
60,"Hazlewood to Misbah, 1 run length ball, angling in, pushed through mid-on, which is unmanned"

64,"Johnson to Misbah, no run short of a length, outside off, right behind it in defence"
65,"Johnson to Misbah, 1 run tucked away off the hip"
66,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run quick, on a length, pretty straight, defended to leg"
67,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run bouncer, pretty quick, he ducks it, but this is hostile, and the bounce is a little variable as this one doesn't come up as much as expected. This is bowled at 152.4ks"
68,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
69,"Hazlewood to Misbah, no run on a length, on off, 143ks, defended back to him"
70,"Hazlewood to Misbah, 1 run cut away to third man for one"

73,"Hazlewood to Misbah, 1 run short of a length, into the ribs, nudged away for a single"

76,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run on a length, on off, right behind it in defence"
77,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run short of a length, on off, he is right behind it as he defends it to mid-on"
78,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run looks to steer this to third man but can't beat Warner at backward point"
79,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, 1 wide this is called a wide, but Haddin is smiling. This is a mean bouncer, rising from not too short. Damn quick too. Haris wants to pull but can't reach it. This is clocked at 143ks"
80,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, 1 run short of a length, pitched outside leg, worked away into the leg side"

85,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run pushed down to long-off"
86,"Maxwell to Misbah, no run flighted around off, pushed back to Maxwell"
87,"Maxwell to Misbah, SIX runs tuk tuk goes bang. Every now and then Misbah plays this shot and invariably he connects. Takes this off a length and sends it over deep midwicket. They need these. Can't let Maxwell sneak in soft overs"

110,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-off for one"
111,"Maxwell to Misbah, SIX runs and Misbah releases pressure. Moves across early to a full ball, gets a full ball, and slogs it over midwicket for six. It is incredible how often he connects them cleanly but how rarely he attempts them"

115,"Watson to Haris Sohail, no run short of a length, pitches leg, angles towards off, defended with an open face"
116,"Watson to Haris Sohail, 1 run impatience from Sohail. Looks to slog this length ball over midwicket, his head falls back as he plays, gets a big top edge that clears backward point and falls short of third man. Misbah has a word with the youngster"

118,"Faulkner to Misbah, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for one"

126,"Watson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs Sohail might have mis-hit a couple, but he has made us his mind he is not going to get bogged. Clears the front leg to a length ball, and lofts a length ball over mid-on"

142,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run down the wicket to drive this full ball down to long-on"
143,"Maxwell to Misbah, OUT oh will you believe it? Maxwell has brought up the breakthrough. Once again no singles for Misbah have meant Pakistan have to take the risks to keep the runs coming. He has previously hit Maxwell out of the attack with two sixes over midwicket, he tries a third one with a slog-sweep. Not quite to the pitch of the ball this time. Fatal. Top edge sits nicely with Finch at deep midwicket. Strange to see a rare hole-out by Misba"
144,"Maxwell to Haris Sohail, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-off for one"
145,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, 2 runs tossed up outside off, gets some drift away, Akmal drives away from the body, gets a thick edge. Would have gone wide of slip even if it had been there"

155,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run on a length, straight, defended to leg"
156,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run looks to cut another length ball, but this has come in towards middle and taken the bottom edge, which somehow evades the stumps. Remember what Swann said of cutting offspinners? It's like patting a burning dog"
157,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run defended to midwicket"
158,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run worked with the turn, finds square leg"
159,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs there is an appeal for a hit-wicket, but Akmal is nowhere near the stumps. He has cut this from off, past point, and the bail is off. Haddin, though, has indicated he is not sure and has already gone to the other end even before the replay is shown. It is Haddin's glove that has brought the bail down"
160,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, 1 run worked to leg for one"
161,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 3 runs lovely shot, down the wicket, straight of mid-on"
162,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, no run that is a sharp bouncer, on middle and leg, angling towards off. Sohail sways out of its line"
163,"Johnson to Haris Sohail, OUT the bouncer has done the trick. Johnson has produced the loose drive with leaden feet. Look at his back foot move away as he drives. Johnson pushes this one up, angling it across Sohail, who drives away from the body, his back foot moving away from the line of the ball. The edge is taken"
164,"Johnson to Maqsood, no run defended off the front foot"
165,"Johnson to Maqsood, 2 runs low full toss, driven wide of cover"
166,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, 1 run bunted past cover for one"

170,"Maxwell to Maqsood, 1 run another single to long-on"
171,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run this one holds its line outside off, or rather doesn't turn as much as expected. Beats the outside edge"
172,"Johnson to Afridi, SIX runs that's No. 351. Oh Shahid, what an entertainer. Length ball, just outside off, he drives with an open face, Finch thinks he is in business at deep point but it sails over it"

179,"Hazlewood to Afridi, no run looks to run this down to third man from just outside off. Opens the face pretty early. Is beaten"
180,"Hazlewood to Afridi, FOUR runs Afridi slashes hard, gets a top edge, and it flies over the keeper's head. This is quite a safe shot. He has given this pull shot his all. More often than not these edges fly safe nowadays"
181,"Hazlewood to Afridi, 1 run moves across to work a low full toss into the leg side"
182,"Hazlewood to Maqsood, 1 run cut away with both his feet in the air, gets a single to third man"
183,"Hazlewood to Afridi, OUT he has found out deep midwicket. Finch has taken three deep midwicket catches today. Oh that short square boundary, what a temptress. Afridi looks to pull, but the ball is not short enough. He doesn't get all of it, Finch is prowling there, and takes this head high. Is this the last time Lala has paced off the field with gloves and pads on?"
184,"Starc to Maqsood, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot"
185,"Starc to Maqsood, no run wide length ball, angling away, he throws his bat it, and is beaten by the angle"

194,"Faulkner to Maqsood, no run full, on off, driven with an open face, but straight to extra cover"
195,"Faulkner to Maqsood, 1 run short of a length, punched back at him. Faulkner misfields to allow a single that breaks the maiden"
196,"Starc to Maqsood, 2 runs moves across to work a length ball in front of deep midwicket"
197,"Starc to Maqsood, 1 run nearly another wicket for Starc. Short of a length, gets big on Maqsood who tries to flick this to leg. Top edge falls clear of midwicket"

199,"Starc to Wahab Riaz, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, allows the easy single"

212,"Starc to Wahab Riaz, no run wide full ball, swinging away, beats the outside edge"

215,"Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, no run swings and misses here"
216,"Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, no run sees him give the charge and bounces him at 141ks. Riaz is swaying out of the line hoping it doesn't hit him"

219,"Faulkner to Maqsood, no run full, on off, driven hard straight to mid-off"

261,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run slower offcutter, on the pads, worked away"
262,"Maxwell to Umar Akmal, OUT what have you done Umar Akmal? This is a long hop at the Adelaide Oval with short square boundaries. Akmal has enough time to pause, do a quick opinion poll on where to hit this in the stands, and then take a selfie before hitting it. Unfortunately for him, he has found out the one man stationed there. Aaron Finch hasn't had to move an inch. Akmal is disgusted with himself. Smashes the bat into his pad"

302,"Faulkner to Ehsan Adil, OUT this time it has gone to hand. Faulkner gets a wicket, Starc takes a lovely catch. Clears the front let to pull, gets a top edge towards top edge, Starc rushes in and takes this low and diving forward"
303,"Pakistan's batsmen once again brought pressure upon themselves. Loose shots at the top, slow going in the middle, resulting in low-percentage cricket. Their batting needs a revolution. How long can they keep asking their bowlers to bail them out? For all their bowling greatness in the '90s, we must not forget that the likes of Saeed Anwar and Inzamam and Mohammad Yousuf were quite modern for that time. They were possibly ahead of the curve. This Pakistan"
304,5.33pm The Australian bowlers have done their job. Some excellent aggressive bowling from them. Starc is back on top of the tree. Hazlewood has proven his line and length is a better pick than Cummins in a team of two other express quick bowlers. Johnson has shown signs of the return of some of the menace. Maxwell produced two crucial wickets in the middle. Faulkner was exceptional in the batting Powerplay and in the end. When Watson bowls five overs for

311,"Sohail Khan to Finch, no run first ball to Finch, nip-backer from Sohail and he's interested, the ball loops to slip but there was not bat involved...

321,"Sohail Khan to Finch, OUT pitched up, this jags back at Finch and raps him on the pads, Sohail implores for the decision... and Dharmasena gives it! Finch, after a brief conversation with his partner, asks for the review but it only takes a quick look to release this was foolishness. Not much footwork and the ball zipped in with the arm, past the inside edge as he played to leg, and it was crashing into the woodwork halfway up. The finger points sk"

370,"Wahab Riaz to Clarke, OUT gottim! The short ball works, Clarke dollies it to forward short leg! Don't you love it when a plan comes together... That was well-directed from Wahab, not quite a snorter but awkward enough for a man with an antique spine, rising towards the helmet grill and Clarke can only pop it up off the splice, floats into the hands of the catcher.

418,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 wide slammed in short, very short and called wide as it sails over the batsman..."

434,"Rahat Ali to Smith, FOUR runs pitched up in the channel, Smith strokes another boundary, pinged through extra cover giving the man in the deep no chance... Raise of the bat for fifty, been a silky knock"

436,"Rahat Ali to Smith, no run pushed towards the slips and Smith taps into the off side coming forwards"

438,"Sohail Khan to Watson, 1 wide Sohail gives up some more loose change, boinging this halfway down and way over the batsman's head"
439,"Sohail Khan to Watson, 1 wide well, this is daft... he's not going to get out if he can't hit them. Pakistan have got carried away with Wahab's success against Watson and Sohail slams another one in that rises too high"
440,"Sohail Khan to Watson, no run better length, still short and climbing towards the throat, defended on the back foot"
441,"Sohail Khan to Watson, FOUR runs short ball, skidding through the body but made to look like a long hop by Watson, wheels a pull away and beats fine leg, four more"

450,"Haris Sohail to Smith, no run tossed up and drifting to leg, Smith flicks at it, runs off the pad, I think, to short fine leg"

472,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, OUT fuller, on the stumps, Smith flicks and misses - given! Adil's appeal was almost a lone one, though Sarfraz also went up, Dharmasena gave it some thought before raising the finger. Australia have used their review, so Smith has to trudge off, having looked impenetrable for the last couple of hours. Looked like it would have clipped leg, fairly innocuous ball, Smith not quite as focused as he had been"

482,"Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 2 runs banged in, Maxwell flaps at it, massive miscue, halfway between a ramp and a top-edged saucapan swat, flies way up, down towards third man - but Sohail Khan drops it on the run!

494,"Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs pitched up on leg stump, not quite the yorker and Maxwell times it supremely off his toes for four through mdiwicket"
495,"Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs steps to leg, Wahab follows him, drops short and Maxwell somehow blaps it through backward point, sort of a tennis shot, totally off balance and yet is whistles away"

506,"Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, SIX runs short ball, Maxwell takes the bait, there's a man out there... but he'd need to be in the crowd. Effortless swivel-pulled six to finish the over and kick Pakistan in the bojangles once more"
507,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, no run shortish, stays back and blocks to the leg side"
508,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, SIX runs there is it, the symbol of victory, Watson takes on the Wahab bouncer and this time nails it into the crowd, over the head of deep square leg. No coming back from here"
