1,"Starc to Gunathilaka, 1 run too full around off, he pushes it into the covers and then dives at the umpire's end to make it in time. Sharp throw but it missed and looks like he was in"
2,"Starc to Dilshan, no run well outside off on length, Dilshan sees room and goes for the big swing but misses"
3,"Starc to Dilshan, no run 147kph! Right on the off stump and moves away a bit to beat Dilshan's outside edge. Some noise from the bat hitting the ground which made Wade appeal"
4,"Starc to Dilshan, no run gets bat this time - slightly wider outside off on length with the angle and Dilshan defends into the covers"
5,"Starc to Dilshan, no run a firm drives back to the bowler this time. Bit too full and straight, Dilshan shows the full face of the bat and Starc gets a hand to it"
6,"Lyon to Gunathilaka, no run starts on the leg stump with some turn, Gunathilaka defends it back"
7,"Lyon to Gunathilaka, no run stumping appeal from Wade as Gunathilaka is beaten by turn outside off, third umpire at work now and easy decision - not out. It was nicely bowled outside off on length and the turn did the rest"
8,"Lyon to Gunathilaka, no run hits the good length again outside off, he plays on the up and gets the ball to point after a bounce"

17,"Starc to Gunathilaka, OUT bowled'im, through the gate! That one pitched on length outside off, and it was the cutter from Starc, it came in after pitching and Gunathilaka's gap between bat and pad was too wide for the ball to sneak through"
18,"Lyon to Dilshan, OUT bowled'im around the legs, is he? They are checking with the replays and it shows the ball touched the pad before clipping the leg stump. Lyon around the wicket, pitches it around middle and leg and gets it to turn a bit, Dilshan wanted to work it away gently with the turn but inadvertently exposed his leg stump and the ball got deflected off the thigh pad and onto the stump."

28,"Starc to Mendis, FOUR runs on the pads and clipped away through the air for four! Wasn't completely full but it was on the leg stump and Mendis flicked it away with the wrists, checking his shot in the end a bit, and it sailed wide and over midwicket"

39,"Starc to Chandimal, no run a confident appeal for caught behind form Australia, they think Chandimal has edged it but the umpire says no. It was pretty full outside off, Chandimal drove away from the body and replays show that was a good decision - ball missed the bat and the sound was of bat hitting the ground"
40,"Starc to Chandimal, no run much closer to the batsman now, still outisde off, he defends it to the leg side off the back foot"
41,"Starc to Chandimal, no run another bouncer - just towards the leg side but not enough for a wide. It was quick and short, Chandimal ducked again and Starc is enjoying that. He sticks his tongue out while staring at Chandimal"
42,"Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs full delivery to end the over, nicely driven with a forward lean through the covers and they get two. Starc collected the ball and then threw it to the keeper but hit Chandimal instead. The batsman didn't like and the umpire had a word with Starc"

44,"Lyon to Mendis, 1 run little shorter towards leg and it's swatted for one"

173,"Starc to Dhananjaya, no run nasty short ball from Starc - 146kmh. He banged it in around middle stump and it went straight towards de Dilva's head. Hard to leave that quick a ball. He takes it on the glove to keep it down and Starc gives him a stare. The crowd replies on de Silva's behalf"

259,"Starc to Perera, SIX runs Starc eyes the toes, Kusal makes room and his bat swing generates such power that even when he doesn't middle it, the ball goes to some planet at least. The powerful flick sent the ball to the leg side, nobody knows where but it went pretty high"

271,"Starc to Perera, 2 runs another edge from Kusal - this one lands just wide of Smith who was running towards his right from midwicket. On middle and leg from Starc and Kusal turned the face of the bat but got the timing wrong. Bit of leading edge fell safe"

285,"Henriques to Perera, FOUR runs that's some shot to unleash on the first ball! Not a great delivery either - short and angling away, allowing Thisara to open his arms and he did it well to send the ball flying over the covers and wide of long-off"
286,"Henriques to Perera, SIX runs short ball, pulled away, Smith jumps at the boundary but it sails over him!"
287,"Henriques to Perera, 1 wide it has disturbed the bowler's line - this one is too wide outside off"

290,"Henriques to Perera, 4 byes mixes it up nicely with a slower ball that beats Thisara, it goes just over the stump, but oh dear! Wade misfields, it goes right through him and for four byes!"
291,"Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, OUT Faulkner strikes again, Mathews hits this one absolutely straight but long-off catches it just inside the boundary. It was full and straight, Mathews hit through the line but it lacked that extra distance and Henriques ran to his right to catch that safely"
292,"Faulkner to Perera, OUT that's a hat-trick from Faulkner, he's knocked over the stumps now! Thisara made some room, Faulkner targetted the stumps and beat the batsman who tried to cut but the bat came down too late. And Faulkner, who does it so often in the slog overs, is pulling things back here. Don't forget his performane in the first ODI!"

298,"Starc to Aponso, no run 148kph! From wide of the crease, Aponso makes a lot of room, but it's too quick and he can't get any bat on that. It wasn't too far from the stumps"

300,"Starc to Aponso, no run outside off, not using that angle that much, big swing and a miss from Aponso"

302,"6.05pm What a see-saw innings this has been, allowing plenty of innings to both teams. The openers went cheaply before Mendis and Chandimal charged some momentum into the innings. But Zampa's flight and legspin got them down to 158 for 5. Then captain Mathews and Kusal Perera came together to first rebuild and then change gears to finally give them the platform for the late surge. They were soon looking"

439,"Aponso to Bailey, no run defended on the front foot"
440,"Aponso to Bailey, OUT bowled him! Bailey's struggle is over for the night. Aponso slowed it up by giving the ball a lot of air, drawing Bailey forward into the cover drive. more of a slap really because he was not to the pitch of the ball.

451,"Aponso to Henriques, no run pitches outside off and turns away, Henriques pushes forward to defend and misses the ball"
452,"Aponso to Henriques, no run lbw! The good old sucker punch that was. But Henriques has asked for a review. The previous ball pitched in a similar area and turned away to beat the bat, this one pitched aroud off and slid on with the arm into the right-hander.
