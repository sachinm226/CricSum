0,"6.05pm: And now the signal does come, Australia have declared on 492 for 9, giving England 20-odd overs to see out this evening. Again they've made good work of batting first, thanks to their two centurions, Shane Watson and Steven Smith. Take that, haters. The pitch still looks good to bat on, as the likes of Faulkner and Harris showed, but with the new ball"
1,James Faulkner to resume sledging duties
2,"Faulkner to Swann, 1 run down the leg side, Swann works the ball off his legs for one"
3,"Faulkner to Prior, no run this stays a bit low outside off and Prior isn't far from playing on, the edge bobbles low through to Haddin"
4,"Faulkner to Prior, FOUR runs full length, drifts on to the pads, just a thin scrape of bat on and the ball runs quickly and very fine for four"
5,"Faulkner to Prior, no run gets across and defends in line with off stump"
6,"Faulkner to Prior, FOUR runs fore! And four, as Prior clears the front leg and bunts the ball through mid-on to the boundary"
7,"Faulkner to Prior, OUT frees the arms again, hitting across the line and gets a top edge, over the bowler, to the left of mid-on, Mitchell Starc, who takes a brilliant diving catch! Looked like it might have dropped safely for a moment but Starc flung himself full length... Prior goes, three short of fifty"
8,"Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs Anderson swings the arms to his first ball and gets a thick edge low through the cordon for a boundary first ball"
9,"Siddle to Anderson, no run slightly full, outside off, punched back towards mid-off"
10,"Siddle to Anderson, no run dug in very short and Anderson ducks underneath it"
11,"Siddle to Anderson, no run beats the edge! Lovely ball from Siddle, holding its line and Anderson just manages to hold his bat in line"
12,"Siddle to Anderson, no run edged and dropped! Haddin shells a chance to equal Rod Marsh's Ashes record of 28 catches in a series! He'll not get many easier, too, as Anderson nicked a length ball through, slightly low to Haddin's left but he got there easily only to cymbals it"
13,"Siddle to Anderson, no run length ball outside of, knocked to mid-off"
14,"Faulkner to Swann, 1 run little bit short and wide, steered into a gap in the covers for a single to Swann"
15,"Faulkner to Anderson, no run over the wicket, very wide and Anderson throws the plumbing, fails to connect"
16,"Faulkner to Anderson, no run tighter line outside off, defended on the back foot"
17,"Faulkner to Anderson, no run back of a length, not really room to cut but Anderson attempts to Sobers it through the covers anyway, misses"
18,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run round the wicket, angled in towards middle stump, Kerrigan crabbily flicks it to midwicket"
19,"Siddle to Swann, no run there's an appeal as Swann hooks and misses, Haddin thinking maybe he'd got another but would have been arm guard if anything, I think"
20,"Siddle to Swann, no run backs away and tries to mow another bouncer over backward square, again fails to connect"
21,"Siddle to Swann, no run on the stumps, turned into the leg side"
22,"Siddle to Swann, FOUR runs Swann continues to shoot from the hip, little foot movement and inside-edged past the stumps for four - Siddle doesn't look happy with that"
23,"Siddle to Swann, FOUR runs short and at the body, pulled through square, hefty blow out of the screws and it flies for four"
24,"Siddle to Swann, no run backs away to leg and has a huge swing, only manages to dig it out towards midwicket"
25,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run drops back and defends from the crease, the ball rebounds on to his body and then just when he thinks it's safe, spins back narrowly wide of off stump"
26,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run fuller length, gets across and defends"
27,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run length delivery, on off stump and a leading edge rolls square as Kerrigan plays across the line"
28,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run gets forward and punches the ball into the covers, looking for one but won't get one"
29,"Faulkner to Kerrigan, 1 run bumper, at the top of Kerrigan's block, he fends it to square leg and gets a big cheer for a single to take him off nought"
30,"Faulkner to Swann, no run length ball in the channel, Swann hacks and misses again"
31,"Siddle to Kerrigan, no run length ball outside off, Kerrigan gets across and plays an exaggerated leave"
32,"Siddle to Kerrigan, no run fuller and straighter, covers his stumps and turns the ball into the leg side"
33,"Siddle to Kerrigan, no run outside off, pushed square from the crease"
34,"Siddle to Kerrigan, no run short ball, again well played by the last man, going back to defend"
35,"Siddle to Kerrigan, no run good length, wide of the stumps, Kerrigan stays back and shoulders arms"
