1,"Malinga to Finch, no run just works away this fuller length outside off towards the mid-on fielder"
2,"Malinga to Finch, 1 run Mathews just moved the second slip as Finch edges this back of a length which swings away, to Mahela, at first slip, who is unable to grasp this as it falls low to his right. Ends up being picked up near third man. Hard to call it a dropped chance as this was definitely going to the second slip. Really difficult for someone even of Mahela's class"

4,"Malinga to Warner, no run defended by Warner to the off side"
5,"Malinga to Warner, no run looks to force away a shot through the covers, but picks out the close-in fielder"

26,"Malinga to Warner, OUT what a set-up from Malinga! this time takes off the pace of this length delivery on middle and off, deceiving Warner as he offers a half-hearted push which finds it way to extra-cover, who is able to take it comfortably. Huge blow for Australia as Warner has to go"
27,"Malinga to Smith, 1 wide shuffles over to the off side as this attempted yorker on leg misses its mark, with the umpire calling a wide. Smith had shuffled over too much, so is lucky that Malinga did not find the target"

223,"Prasanna to Maxwell, 2 runs the lofted flick now, flighted delivery and just outside off, Maxwell picks out the gap at wide long on, Chandimal gets across and keeps them down to a couple"
224,"Prasanna to Maxwell, 2 runs able to get away a flick through to deep midwicket as he completes a brace"
225,"Malinga to Watson, 2 runs leg-stump half-volley from Malinga which is flicked away behind square on the on side for a couple of runs"
226,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run hooks the bowler now through to long leg to get Maxwell on strike"
227,"Malinga to Maxwell, FOUR runs just too good. Simply too good. Maxwell takes on one of the best bowlers in the game as he lines up this yorker on middle with an aerial scythe through extra-cover to find the boundary. Predictable from Malinga, but Maxwell still managed to put him away"
228,"Malinga to Maxwell, 1 run slower delivery on and around leg which is struck away towards long on as Maxwell helps raise the fifty-run partnership between these two"
229,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs Watson has a wry smile as he pushes at this fuller delivery outside off to find the boundary at long on"
230,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs Watson looks to have carried on from Maxwell here as he now hooks this shorter delivery on leg through backward square to make it consecutive boundaries"
231,"Perera to Maxwell, 2 runs gets this slower ball horribly wrong as Maxwell carts this full toss away to deep midwicket for a brace"
232,"Perera to Maxwell, SIX runs provides him some pace now, which Maxwell laps up as he heaves over deep midwicket to just get this over the rope. Brings up yet another World Cup fifty, this one coming off just 26 balls."
233,"Perera to Maxwell, 1 run just can't keep him quiet as he gets to the other end after this attempted pickup shot through fine leg fails to come off"
234,"Perera to Watson, no run meets this back of a length delivery outside of off, but can't pinch the run"
235,"Perera to Watson, 1 run turns away this back of a length through midwicket to get to the other end"
236,"Perera to Maxwell, no run slower delivery which Maxwell tried to get up and under as he waited on it, but ends up getting through the stroke late as it continued through to the keeper"
237,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs looking to go full and straight as this one dips away to the leg side. Watson manages to bissect the tight gap between deep fine leg and square leg with a flick that bursts through to the boundary"
238,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run dishes up a low, full toss on middle and off which is re-directed away through square-leg"
239,"Malinga to Maxwell, 1 run low, full toss on the pads as he misses again for the blockhole. Maxwell tried to get under it in hopes of getting it over the deep at midwicket, but ends up hitting this away to the deep fine leg fielder"
240,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run chips away this attempted yorker on middle and leg, getting this towards midwicket, but thankfully, not all the way to the fielder as he didn't quite middle this"
241,"Malinga to Maxwell, no run slower, length delivery going down leg which Maxwell clears his front leg to before arriving slightly early for the pick-up shot over the leg side, with the ball crashing into his stomach"
242,"Malinga to Maxwell, 1 run another attempted yorker which is sent straying down the leg side. Maxwell could have left this alone to be called wide, but ends up getting a bat on it to flick it away behind of square"
243,"Prasanna to Maxwell, FOUR runs darts one in on middle which is slammed quite flat over deep midwicket for a boundary"
244,"Prasanna to Maxwell, FOUR runs another one which allows Maxwell some pace to manipulate as he now works this away behind of square on the leg side with a paddle"

246,"Prasanna to Maxwell, FOUR runs waits on this one flighted in on middle and leg before striking this away through cow corner for a boundary"
247,"Prasanna to Maxwell, 1 run looks for the slice over the covers as this one lands a few bounces before the deep cover fielder. Gets Maxwell of strike, much to Prasanna's delight"
248,"Prasanna to Watson, 2 runs works with the leg-side slant to pickup a brace behind of square"
249,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, FOUR runs what can you do when you are bowling to this? length delivery which Maxwell is able to switch-hit away through third man for a boundary. Looked way too comfortable as that was executed"
250,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, no run full delivery outside of off as this is drilled straight to mid-off. Fastest World Cup century on the cards here"
251,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, 3 runs dropped I thought I may have just committed the most cardinal of sins after that last proclamation. Maxwell, who was looking to lift this fuller delivery over fine leg with a pick-up shot, ends up skying this high over long leg, with the fielder in the deep running full tilt to try and get under the catch, but is unable to quite grasp it"
252,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run dabs away a run through third man as the Show gets back on strike"
253,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, 1 run just content to nurdle a run over to the leg side as Watson gets to the other end"
254,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run carves away a run through to deep cover to finish off the over"
255,"Perera to Maxwell, OUT and the curtains are drawn on yet another Maxwell blinder as he fails to get away this full-toss delivey from Perera, with this going straight up over mid-on, with Malinga doing well to complete the catch, with a tumble to finish. Maxwell hasn't yet departed as they are looking at the front foot no ball. No issues there as he was miles behind the crease. Looks like this was also a legitimate delivery as it"
256,"Perera to Watson, 1 run Watson scythes away this fuller delivery outside off to the man at cover to get Faulkner on strike"
257,"Perera to Faulkner, OUT in the slot again as Faulkner is obligated to get to the other end after he hears Watson's call. Drilled this to the fielder at cover, who is able to pick it up and throw it to Perera at the non-striker's, who is able to flick off the bails before Faulkner grounded his bat. Bonus wicket for Sri Lanka as Faulkner goes for a golden duck"
258,"Perera to Watson, 2 runs picks up a couple through long on as they are able to hustle the first one hard enough to come back for the second in time of the throw"
259,"Perera to Watson, FOUR runs I am almost positive Glenn has departed from the middle as Watto channels his inner Maxwell with this slice over deep extra-cover which he falls away on as he groped at the full delivery. Ends up landing near the boundary, and then getting over the rope, before the boundary rider from sweeper cover could get there"
260,"Perera to Watson, 1 run sensibly guides away a single through midwicket to retain the strike"
261,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run follows him with a yorker on leg as this is clipped away by Watson through midwicket"
262,"Malinga to Haddin, 1 run very full outside off stump as Haddin drives it to mid-off and sets off"
263,"Malinga to Watson, no run makes room and drills this full ball very hard, but straight to mid-off"
264,"Malinga to Watson, no run again makes room, but Slinga bowls a pin-point yorker to keep Watto honest"
265,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run Watson sends another slice over extra-cover, with this one picked up in the deep by the fielder"
266,"Malinga to Haddin, 1 run careened away inside-out to the extra-cover fielder, who is more than equal to the task"
267,"Perera to Watson, SIX runs gets this one horribly wrong as he dishes a full toss which is swatted away baseball-style through midwicket for a flat six"
268,"Perera to Watson, 1 run content to just guide away a single through long on to get Maxxie boy on strike"
269,"Perera to Maxwell, FOUR runs even his mishits seem to get to the rope as he mistimes this attempt cart through midwicket to flat-bat this over long off, with this just beating the dive from the boundary rider to the rope"
270,"Perera to Maxwell, no run delivers a fuller, slow delivery which Maxwell drills straight to the cover fielder"
271,"Perera to Maxwell, SIX runs just waits on this slower delivery outside off before dispatching it with a pull over midwicket for six. Unbelievable ball-striking from Maxwell!"
272,"Perera to Maxwell, 1 wide searching for the wide yorker as he strays too far down the margin"
273,"Perera to Maxwell, 2 runs looking for some runs through midwicket, as he is able to power through the first to get back for the second in the nick of time to get into the 90s. Met with generous applause from the SCG crowd"
274,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, SIX runs Watson is dialed in now as Mathews delivers a full delivery which is tonked high over cow corner for six. Is looking in ominous form at the moment"
275,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 wide looks to reach out to this length delivery well wide of off, which is called wide by the umpire"
276,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run trying to bowl another wide one which is slapped away to deep point by Watson"
277,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, FOUR runs now it is Maxwell's turn as he inches ever closer to the record with a hard slap over the covers to this fuller length on and around off. Just slapped it away really, but went to the boundary at a rate of knots"
278,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, 2 runs dropped when it is your day, it is your day. Not even the great Sangakkara can stop this assault as Maxwell, looking for the unorthodox ramp over fine leg, ends up skying this high through deep fine leg, with Sanga haring on this before putting in a dive towards the right, but fails to take this. Looks frustrated as he realised the significance of that blunder"
279,"Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, 1 run Maxwell now moves to 96 with a scythe towards extra-cover"
280,"Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run slower ball just outside off which is fended away by Watson to the off side"
281,"Perera to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin reminds Sri Lanka of his presence with this powerful strike over extra-cover which just sails over the boundary. Perera dished up a length delivery which Haddin took care of in his own inimitable way"
282,"Perera to Haddin, FOUR runs shuffles a bit in his crease before lasering this fuller delivery from Perera past the extra-cover fielder, who fails to get behind it as it bursts through to the boundary. Mathews was the culprit there"
283,"Perera to Haddin, FOUR runs now targets the vacant space at long off with a heave which clears the mid-off fielder on the ring comfortably"
284,"Perera to Haddin, FOUR runs Perera. It's okay. These things can happen in cricket... fires in a yorker on leg which Haddin somehow gets a feather of an inside-edge to as this screams away through fine leg for four. Perera would be feeling mighty hard done by that effort"
285,"Perera to Haddin, 1 run dropped really symbolises the kind of day Sri Lanka has had so far as the fielder at deep midwicket drops the ball when Haddin sends an uppish flick over the region. Prasanna was the man in the deep, as he has a rather sheepish look on his face"
286,"Perera to Watson, OUT Watson now looking for the long blast over long off, but Chandimal who is able to settle under this top-edge, is able to complete a catch finally in the deep. Ends a fantastic knock from Watson who has done his World Cup campaign a whole lot of good with this effort"
287,"Angelo Mathews to Johnson, 1 run just gets bat on ball to caress this fuller length going across towards the covers. Gets Haddin back on strike"
288,"Angelo Mathews to Haddin, FOUR runs overpitched delivery on middle and leg which Haddin is able to get up and under as he flicks this one through backward square for four"
289,"Angelo Mathews to Haddin, OUT slower length delivery now which Haddin looks to send orbiting over Sydney, but ends up slicing away over to cover, who is able to get under it safely. Has to go as Australia look to rack up as many as possible off these final deliveries"
290,"Angelo Mathews to Johnson, 1 run, OUT hammers away this length delivery through long on, with Johnson wanting two from the get-go. The fielder in the deep pounces on this before sending in flat throw to Mathews, who is able to knock over the stumps before Starc had grounded his bat. The second run was never really on there, but you got to do what you got to do"
291,"Angelo Mathews to Johnson, 1 run heaves this fuller delivery towards deep midwicket, but is held to just the one after this arrived a bit too quickly to the fielder"
292,"Angelo Mathews to Doherty, 1 bye length delivery shaping away as he fails to make any connection with this, but they still end up running the bye as Sangakkara has a shy at the stumps"
293,"6.13 pm: So in the end, Australia rack up an imposing 376 for 9, led from the front by the 134-run third-wicket partnership between Michael Clarke and Steven Smith which settled the innings, before Maxwell and Watson went ballistic in the end to power them to this significant total."
294,"Glenn Maxwell: It is nice to finally get the monkey off the back. Scored a few 90s recently, so it is nice to finally pull through. It is a big relief to get it out of the way, and hopefully it is the first of many. The top order set us up beautifully to have a little bit of fun at the end. Just need to maintain a good line and length and backup our bowling with some good fielding."
295,"6.18 pm: Maxwell finally gets to that elusive ODI hundred which may have just taken this game beyond Sri Lanka. We will be back soon for the chase, but don't forget to tune into Match Point, which should be starting very soon. And while you watch that, take in this latest piece from Sa'adi Thawfeeq on Sangakkara, who has made an important declaration regarding his Test career, which you will have to read about here. See you in a bit!"
296,"Starc to Thirimanne, no run on a good length and on the stumps, Thirimanne prods across and defends it towards mid-on"

298,"Starc to Dilshan, no run swing and a miss from Dilshan, went chasing after a full ball that nipped away, doesn't connect with the drive"
299,"Starc to Dilshan, no run Starc keeps it very full and well outside off, Dilshan looks to steer it towards third man, the ball beats the outside edge"

301,"Starc to Thirimanne, no run on a good length and just outside off, Thirimanne defends it with an open face"
302,"Johnson to Dilshan, no run tries to get away this length delivery off the pads with an attempted flick off the pads, but is late on it"
303,"Johnson to Dilshan, 3 runs much better from Dilshan, tad fuller and just outside off, he gets half-forward and pushes it back past the bowler, the timing isn't spot on but the batsmen run well and get back for the third run"
304,"Johnson to Thirimanne, no run tucks away this length delivery on middle and leg towards the leg side"
305,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run short of a length outside of off which is allowed to go through to the keeper"
306,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run shortish length which Sangakkara is able to get on top off as the over comes to a close"
307,"Starc to Dilshan, no run looks to crash Starc through the covers, but is late on this as it just nibbles away from the outside edge of his bat. Got great carry across the batsman there"
308,"Starc to Dilshan, 1 run manages to get away a thick outside edge through third man as he looked to target the covers once more"
309,"Starc to Sangakkara, no run defends this back of a length at the top of the bounce, and close to his body"

314,"Johnson to Dilshan, 1 run gets away a drop single through mid-off to bring Sangakkara on strike"
315,"Johnson to Sangakkara, 2 runs jabs away this slightly back of a length through extra-cover as they are able to return for the second after hustling through the first run"
316,"Johnson to Sangakkara, FOUR runs shortish length which Sangakkara is able to manipulate through backward square with a rather awkward pull that just makes it away. Not the most convincing shot, but it got the result he wanted"
317,"Johnson to Sangakkara, no run fires in a pacey delivery on middle and leg which raps the top of Sangakkara's pads as he looked to glance away the delivery, but there was a definite inside-edge. Sent that in at 149kph!"
318,"Starc to Dilshan, no run searching for the slightly wide yorker as he offers up a low full toss which Dilshan fails to punish away through the covers"
319,"Starc to Dilshan, 2 runs now flicks away the pacer behind of square on the leg side for a brace"

327,"Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs Dilshan is taking on Mitchell at the SCG as he pulls this shortish length from the left-arm pacer over backward square to make it four in four. Really got that one out of the screws."
328,"Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs Mitchell is being taken to the cleaners here as he smokes away this overpitched length outside off through the covers for a boundary. Has already taken 20 from the over, and there is still a delivery to go. Mitchell just turns back and heads to his bowling mark"
329,"Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs Dilshan makes it six in a row as he initially looked to play at this fuller delivery before noticing the change of pace to adjust his shot as he pushed at the length to get it away to the extra-cover boundary. The outfield makes sure this reaches the target in the end"
330,"Watson to Sangakkara, 3 runs a huge cheer rings across the ground as Sangakkara appears to have pushed this length delivery through the gap at extra-cover, but is pulled back before the rope"

377,"Maxwell to Sangakkara, FOUR runs gets deep in his crease before finessing this past backward point, who is unable to stop this despite the dive, as the outfield takes care of the rest. Timed that away so late off the bat, but it achieves the desired result. Pure class from Sanga"
