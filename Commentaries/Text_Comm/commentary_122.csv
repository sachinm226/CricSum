1,"Stanlake to Zaman, FOUR runs good morning, Mr Stanlake. Starts with a nice, juicy leg-stump half-volley that has been flicked neatly to the square leg boundary. Easy"
2,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run slants a length ball across the left-hander, left alone"
3,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run slash and a miss. Beaten for pace, extra bounce as well that time for big Billy"
4,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run ripper of a bouncer, late on the pull. Got big on him as well."
5,"Stanlake to Zaman, no run looks to pull this into the bleachers, misses. Pace from Stanlake again"
6,"Stanlake to Zaman, FOUR runs too much width this time, Fakhar has blasted that through cover and point. Cracking stroke!"
7,"Jhye Richardson to Haris Sohail, OUT chips this straight to square leg. Soft dismissal, Haris' poor run continues. This is a length ball that bounces a touch more than the batsman expects, closed the bat face early, hit this off the top part of the bat and ended up spooning a dolly."
8,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, no run skiddy back of length delivery across the left-hander, left alone"
9,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, 1 run gentle little dab off an angled bat past the slips for an easy single."

11,"Jhye Richardson to Zaman, 1 run back of length on middle and leg, clipped to long leg"
12,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, no run backs away to loft over the bowler's head, but no timing as he gets this off a thick inside edge. Rolls back down the pitch"
13,"Stanlake to Zaman, FOUR runs imperious! Picks the length early, swivels and pulls over square leg. Lovely use of his wrists to pick the gap."
14,"Stanlake to Zaman, FOUR runs savage blow, this time in front of square. Disdainfully slapped through midwicket. Once again Stanlake pays the price for being too short."
15,"Stanlake to Zaman, FOUR runs cracking stroke, belted on the bounce over the point fielder. Hit that hard into the turf, so the fielder at the edge of the ring stood no chance. Too much width this time"

17,"Stanlake to Talat, no run backs away to upper cut but is beaten for pace"
18,"Stanlake to Talat, no run squeezes this drive straight to backward point."

21,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, FOUR runs pulled, not in control but he'll still get four. Mid-on is just escorting that to the fence."
22,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, 2 runs whips this to fine leg. Stanlake took ages to run in and bend down to the ball, excellent running"
23,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, 1 wide steep bouncer, shaped to pull but let it go. Wide for bounce."
24,"Jhye Richardson to Talat, 2 wide slides this down leg, Carey doesn't stop it cleanly either."

31,"Tye to Talat, no run slower and fuller on off stump, squeezed to the cover region"
32,"Tye to Talat, no run dropped at mid-off! Stoinis was a little late to move. Talat looked to flat bat this over the bowler's head, but got it high on the bat."
33,"Tye to Talat, 1 run steered down to third man as they jog the single"
34,"Stoinis to Talat, FOUR runs sliced into the gap between cover and point. Not convincing, he wanted to go over long-off, but will take the runs anyway."
35,"Stoinis to Talat, 1 run works this length ball on middle and leg towards square leg"

41,"Maxwell to Talat, no run inside-edges a premeditated reverse sweep to short third man"
42,"Maxwell to Talat, no run cuts, but can't find the gap. Straight to point"
43,"Maxwell to Talat, 2 runs rocks back and pulls this shortish delivery towards deep midwicket"
44,"Maxwell to Talat, FOUR runs too short, punished. Enough time to open up the leg side and hammer this into the gap at wide long-on"
45,"Maxwell to Talat, no run goes right back into the crease and defends."
46,"Agar to Zaman, no run squeezes this full yorker-length delivery back to the bowler"
47,"Agar to Zaman, no run steps out and belts this back on the bounce to Agar"
48,"Agar to Zaman, FOUR runs swept towards deep backward square leg, Tye can't get there."
49,"Agar to Zaman, SIX runs huge, huge! This is stunning batting. Picked his slot, got to the pitch and swung this with the spin and breeze, cleared the ropes comfortably. They aren't small boundaries, mind you"
50,"Agar to Zaman, 2 runs swung away, deep midwicket and long-on converge to keep that to two"
51,"Agar to Zaman, 1 run fired flat on middle and leg, tucked towards square leg"
52,"Maxwell to Zaman, 1 run works this into the leg side as they scamper a single"

54,"Maxwell to Zaman, 1 run makes room and eases this wide of point"
55,"Maxwell to Talat, SIX runs striking right out of the top drawer. Stepped out, didn't get to the pitch but had the guts to hit through the line and loft inside-out over the cover boundary"
56,"Maxwell to Talat, no run steps out and blocks this full and fast delivery"
57,"Maxwell to Talat, OUT beaten by one that slides in, cramps him for room and crashes into the stumps. Completely misread the line as he looked to cut. Good innings nonetheless from Talat"

60,"Stanlake to Zaman, 1 run pulled, all along the ground to deep square leg"
61,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run excellent short ball, Sarfraz ducks under this. Called one for the over for height."
62,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run gets half a stride in and guides this length delivery to point"
63,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run bunts this into the off side, too close to the fielders to attempt a run"
64,"Maxwell to Zaman, 1 run steps out and smashes the cover off this, excellent stop by Agar at extra cover, just a half-stop mind you but he took the pace off to save three runs"
65,"Maxwell to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs swept nicely to the square leg boundary. Did so with the spin, got just a touch outside the line to allow the stroke."
66,"Maxwell to Sarfaraz, 1 run tucks this wide of short fine leg for an easy single"
67,"Maxwell to Zaman, SIX runs clobbered deep into the stands at deep midwicket, out onto the roof. That is the shortest boundary at the ground, fifty for Fakhar. Super knock."
68,"Maxwell to Zaman, 1 run drills this down to long-on"
69,"Maxwell to Sarfaraz, 1 run dabs this slider towards point for a quick single"
70,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run steep bouncer, Sarfraz hustled for pace as he hops back to fend. Took the bottom glove off the bat as he faced that"
71,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, 2 runs driven into the gap at cover, check drive but timed nicely."
72,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run has he got the edge? No. Beauty. Squared up. Angled in, and left him late as Sarfraz poked."
73,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, no run steered, Maxwell puts out his right hand at point to stop that. Was travelling"
74,"Stanlake to Sarfaraz, SIX runs muscled over deep midwicket. Picked the length, his spot and just applied all his might in swatting that away"

81,"Tye to Malik, 1 run eases this full delivery down to long-on to get off the mark immediately"
82,"Tye to Zaman, SIX runs this is a typical Fakhar special. This is length on leg stump, he stays inside the crease and just whips it over deep backward square leg with minimal feet movement."
83,"Agar to Malik, no run bunts this to cover, looks for a single, but sent back"
84,"Agar to Malik, 2 runs rocks back and cuts to deep point, misfield by Darcy Short means they get another."
85,"Agar to Malik, SIX runs smashed straight into the sightscreen. Steps out, gets underneath the flight and times this magnificently."
86,"Agar to Malik, 1 run whips this to midwicket"
87,"Agar to Zaman, FOUR runs too short, he helps this on its way to the deep backward square leg boundary. Walked across to pick his spot and when the ball arrived, just signed it with love and sent it on its way"
88,"Agar to Zaman, 1 run steps out and works this down to long on"
89,"Stoinis to Zaman, FOUR runs looks to swing over long-on but gets a thick outside edge that bounces towards the third man boundary. The fielder there tried to stop, but ended up parrying it over the ropes."
90,"Stoinis to Zaman, OUT the party is over, he can only toe-end this pull as far as the edge of the ring at midwicket. Went for a biff across the line, ended up having to fetch it from too far outside."
91,"Stoinis to Malik, 1 run steers this short of length delivery down to square third man"
92,"Stoinis to Asif Ali, no run right behind the line of this length delivery as he defends."

95,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, 2 runs slaps this length delivery back past the bowler, hit straight and really hard."
96,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, no run swing and a miss. Looked to make room and slap this through cover."
97,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, 2 runs pulled, but safe. Long-on was running in, midwicket was running sideways, and this fell right between both of them. Asif still had to dive full stretch to get back in time, as the fielder threw to the bowler, who fired a rocket throw to Carey in the hope of a run out"
98,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, 1 run slices this attempted hoick over midwicket to third man on the bounce"
99,"Jhye Richardson to Malik, no run reaches out to this wide delivery and steers this straight to point"

103,"Stoinis to Malik, no run backs away to go over point, Stoinis follows him and cramps him for room, beaten."
104,"Stoinis to Malik, FOUR runs sliced over backward point, bounces into the third man fence. Wonder if he deliberately opened the face of the bat, yes he did, as replays confirm."
105,"Stoinis to Malik, FOUR runs this time he wallops this between cover and point. Makes hell lot of room, bowler follows him but Malik somehow manages to open up more space and use the width to flat bat this up and over in front of square. Magnificent"
106,"Stoinis to Malik, 1 wide wide yorker, reaches out to squeeze this but can't lay bat to it. Clever from Stoinis"
107,"Stoinis to Malik, 1 run full toss, swung away on the bounce to long-on"
108,"Tye to Malik, 1 run this is a waist-high full toss or just below at max, swung away but no control over the stroke, plonks in front of the man coming in from deep midwicket"
109,"Tye to Asif Ali, 1 run squeezes this yorker length delivery to long-on"
110,"Tye to Malik, OUT lofted, but straight to cover. No power, tried to hit it too hard, got it off the bottom. The length did the trick, blockhole almost, Malik almost had to dig it out."
111,"Tye to Asif Ali, 1 run whips this full delivery down to wide long-on"
112,"Tye to Faheem, no run leg-stump yorker which he looks to flick but misses, may have clipped the pad on the way."
113,"Tye to Faheem, no run swing and a miss, deceived by the slower one"
114,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, SIX runs backs away, opens the bat face and slices this full delivery over backward point, excellent improvisation"

116,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, FOUR runs slower bouncer, he shaped to pull in front of square but then held his shape for split second and instead helped this up and over short fine. Clever"
117,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, 2 runs toe-ends a lofted hit on the bounce to long-off"
118,"Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, 1 run whips this down to long-on"
119,"Jhye Richardson to Faheem, OUT this has been clobbered straight to Maxwell at long-off, he was a few yards in, this was struck fiercely. He needed some leeway there, in case he overbalanced in trying to take this, but he made it look very easy. Went along with the momentum, took a couple of steps back after taking the catch before steadying himself to"
120,"Tye to Shadab, 1 run sliced to deep point, they think of the second, don't take"
121,"Tye to Asif Ali, SIX runs hit hard, hit straight and out of the ground. Too full on middle from wide of the crease, he made room, swung through like a golfer. Tremendous strike. Onto the roof and out of the ground. Held his pose nicely for the shutterbugs afterwards"
122,"Tye to Asif Ali, 1 run driven towards extra cover for an easy single"
123,"Tye to Shadab, SIX runs walks across and whips this full toss on middle over the fine leg boundary. Used the pace and scooped it away nonchalantly"

125,"Tye to Asif Ali, FOUR runs squeezes this off a thick inside edge to the fine leg boundary to end the innings. On another day, this would've crashed into the leg stump."
126,"11.35am This is an imposing total, one Pakistan will be delighted with after being put in to bat. Solid platform at the top courtesy Hussain Talat after losing a wicket first ball, the middle-overs acceleration coming from Fakhar Zaman, and the end-overs flourish courtesy Shoaib Malik and Asif Ali. Australia's fielding suffered and bowling very inconsistent."
127,11.45am That was a very short turnaround thanks to the over-rate. We're back on. D'arcy Short and Aaron Finch are Australia's openers predictably. Mohammad Amir with the new ball.
128,"Amir to Short, no run straightens after angling in from wide of the crease, nice shape. defended."
129,"Amir to Short, FOUR runs width outside off, he glides this down to third man where the fielder lets it through his legs, boundary when it should've just been one The fielder? 18-year old Shaheen Afridi"

138,"Faheem to Finch, 2 leg byes works this off his hip towards the man coming in from deep square, lazy fielding, alert running"

141,"Amir to Finch, 1 run whips this length ball on middle towards square leg, looks like there was a thick inside edge."
