0,"1pm: South Africa win the toss and bowl, and the big team news is that Hashim Amla is out with the flu. Rilee Rossouw will take his place (there's no Temba Bavuma, who scored a ton against Ireland on debut last week, in the SA squad); Dwaine Pretorius and Aaron Phangiso lose out to the returning Dale Steyn and Imran Tahir. Steven Smith says he would have prefer"
1,"Steyn to Warner, no run over the wicket, steams in and places the ball on a length, shaping back and blocked in front of the stumps"
2,"Steyn to Warner, no run tight lines from Steyn - it's like he never went away - and Warner has to be watchful in defence again"
3,"Steyn to Warner, 3 runs pitched up, a fraction wide and Warner bullies it through the covers, gets forward and cuffs three between two men out towards the boundary rope"
4,"Steyn to Finch, no run done him, 134kph and swinging the outside edge! Not a very edifying shot from Finch, trying to belabour his first ball over cover and failing to connect"

10,"Rabada to Finch, no run pitched up in the channel outside off, Finch leans into a mistimed drive"

16,"Steyn to Warner, 1 leg bye short, slightly leg side, jumps a bit and deflects behind square off the padding"
17,"Steyn to Finch, no run back of a length, this seems to nip in a fraction, Finch wears it on the thigh pad"
18,"Steyn to Finch, FOUR runs driven, in the air, did Steyn get a hand on that? Yes, looks like he did, just grazed the fingertips, though hard to call it a drop... Thumped back down the ground for Finch's first runs"

30,"Steyn to Finch, no run Finch shuffles across and taps the ball away to leg again"

32,"Steyn to Finch, FOUR runs too straight this time and Finch helps himself, length on the pads and clipped with alacrity through backward square leg"
33,"Rabada to Warner, 2 runs comes forward and pushes a length ball into the off side, mid-off gets to it and underarms into the non-striker's stumps... with the ricochet gifting Australia a second run"

43,"Steyn to Warner, no run drags his length back a touch, 142kph and shaping on middle and leg, tucked to midwicket"

45,"Rabada to Finch, 1 leg bye fullish, curving in, flicks off the pad as Finch works across the line"
46,"Rabada to Warner, no run give it some licks! Warner hops back and takes a 151kph ball on the body, wind briefly knocked from his sails. The Gazelle of Doom walks back to his mark with a quiet smile on his face"

57,"Steyn to Warner, no run better line and length, 145kph on middle and off, blocked"

59,"Parnell to Finch, 1 run goes short in response and Finch muscles a pull to deep backward square, just one with the man out there"
60,"Parnell to Warner, OUT chipped to mid-off, Parnell strikes! Maybe stopped in the pitch a fraction... Certainly Warner was not on top of a regulation check drive, looped off the face of the bat and Phehlukwayo held on running to his right. All going off in Parnell's opening over"

69,"Phehlukwayo to Finch, FOUR runs bit of width outside off and Finch slams four more through backward point! Two dots morph into 16 runs conceded in Phehlukwayo's opening over, a brutal back-foot mow skimming past the diving fielder"
70,"Parnell to Smith, FOUR runs whipped of the pads, that's timed like a Rolex by Smith, just a step into line and he gets it in front of deep square leg for his first runs"
71,"Parnell to Smith, no run jumps across to defend down into the off side"
72,"Parnell to Smith, no run touch short, Smith tries to flick to leg and this time is hit on the thigh pad"

74,"Parnell to Smith, no run tighter to the stumps, Smith pushes back towards the bowler"
75,"Parnell to Smith, no run digs in the bouncer, Smith ducks nonchalantly underneath"
76,"Phehlukwayo to Finch, OUT short ball, flicked off the body in the air, Parnell throws himself forward at short fine leg... but did it carry?

It was a tumbling effort on the edge of the ring, looks on first glance that he managed to get his fingers"

83,"Rabada to Marsh, no run better line, driven into the ground, Rabada sticks out a paw to stop it"
84,"Rabada to Marsh, FOUR runs full toss and treated as such, a Marsh blast back past the bowler, beats mid-off and races away - that's the Australian ton up"
85,"Rabada to Marsh, no run good length outside off, lets this one go"
86,"Rabada to Marsh, FOUR runs dug in short at 140kph and smashed on the pull through midwicket! That is the shot of a man who is seeing it well, just his sixth delivery"
87,"Rabada to Marsh, no run line and and length outside off, happy to let this through and finish an expensive over with a dot"
88,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run lovely shape on this one, moving away late from a fullish length, drawing Bailey forward like a magnet before beating the bat"

105,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run angled in and defended into the leg-side"

108,"Parnell to Marsh, no run solid defence on the front foot"
109,"Parnell to Marsh, no run well bowled again, a fraction back of a length, and a very tight line across the right-hander. Forcing Australia to hit on the up if they dare"

115,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs that's a tremendous wallop through midwicket, rocking back and summing up the length with a dismissive waft of the bat. Shades of Punter in that expert length-picking"
116,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run crunched down the ground, so straight that it splats the non-striker's stumps. That would have been four all the way"
117,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 wide another whistling bouncer, but he's bowled his one for the over, so this one is called. Unlucky, as that was a good sharp delivery"
118,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, OUT edged, and stunningly caught by a one-handed de Kock behind the stumps! The extra delivery pays dividends, as Marsh hangs back in the crease, is drawn into a loose poke by the extra bounce, and the keeper snaffles it almost in slow motion, high to his right! Lucky strikes again! Trebles all round!"

120,"Parnell to Bailey, 1 run wafted off the back foot, out to deep point"

123,"Parnell to Head, no run a bit of swing from a full length, Head shoulders arms"
124,"Parnell to Head, FOUR runs a whistling flick through midwicket to finish the over. Even better contact than his opening boundary. You can't stray near this chap's pads!"
125,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run punched down to mid-on"
126,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, no run beautiful bowling... now you see it, now you don't. Outside off, hitting the seam, lay a bat on that if you can!"
127,"Phehlukwayo to Bailey, 1 run fuller and floatier. Drilled into the covers with lots of bottom hand for emphasis"
128,"Phehlukwayo to Head, no run punched back to the bowler, well timed again but too straight to beat the man in his followthrough"

130,"Phehlukwayo to Head, 1 run on the hands, flicked square"
131,"Tahir to Head, 1 run on the pads, worked fine and blimey, that would have been out by a mile if Parnell's shy had smashed the stumps at the non-striker's end. Tahir could have done a bit more to get behind the stumps too..."

140,"Behardien to Bailey, no run an ambitious wipe, aiming to clear mid-off, but no connection this time"
141,"Behardien to Bailey, no run tight line, offering nothing to get one's teeth into. Defended back to the bowler with a frustrated push"
142,"Behardien to Bailey, SIX runs a big mow, a spiralling top-edge, who wants this ... no, in fact, it's cleared everyone and caught the breeze in the thin Highveld air, and plopped over the rope at third man! A bit of a let-off. Not the most convincing six of his career"

144,"Tahir to Bailey, 1 run another googly, turns sharply and defended to the leg side"

157,"Tahir to Head, no run clipped off the pads but straight to midwicket"
158,"Tahir to Head, no run good areas ..."
159,"Tahir to Head, OUT that is tremendous wrist-spin bowling. Beautiful flight, luring Head out of the crease, dipping late, and lo and behold, it's the googly to boot. Zips past a flailing edge like a winger side-stepping the fullback, and off come the bails!"
160,"Tahir to Wade, no run cripes, that was close! Down on one knee for the sweep, and that plants a smacker on the new batsman's chest! If it had turned, he could easily have been bowled round his legs as he was nowhere near that"

164,"Steyn to Bailey, FOUR runs a genuine edge, and a simple catch for second slip in a Test match... but this is a one-dayer, so it's a well-placed four through third man. Sucks to be a bowler these days..."
165,"Steyn to Bailey, FOUR runs a crashing cut, as Steyn loses his line in a slightly furious upping of the pace, and that is slam-basted through third man. A costly return so far ..."

200,"Rabada to Zampa, no run pitched up and following the batsman to leg, squeezed out"
201,"Rabada to Zampa, no run appeal for lbw, followed by a missed run out at each end! All that for nothing... Rabada speared the ball into the blockhole, think Zampa bottom-edged it on to his boot, set off for the run, de Kock missed with an underarm and then Rabada chose not to throw at the non-striker's end with Bailey struggling to regain his ground!"
202,"Rabada to Zampa, no run banged in short and searing through above the attempted pull to finish the over"
203,"Steyn to Bailey, OUT the slower ball does him! Bailey gets right underneath it and slogs to mid-on, all height and no trousers, Australia's linchpin falls! Still almost three overs to go but Bailey had to try and get on with it if they are to breach 300"

207,"Steyn to Zampa, 3 runs slugged over the off-side ring, a mishit drive but Phehlukwayo has his work cut out to get there... skims the fingertips but he can't hold on! Would have been a brilliant take coming down over his shoulder"

217,"Tahir to Hastings, no run big lbw shout from Tahir, Hastings back in his crease, umpire Bongani Jele shakes the head... but SA like it and roll out the review.

226,"Rabada to Zampa, 1 run full-bunger to finish, Zampa makes room and clubs one through mid-off - decent over from the Gazelle of Doom, kept his figures just about respectable"
227,"Steyn to Zampa, OUT scooped straight up and taken at mid-on! Second wicket for Dale Steyn, a carbon copy of Bailey's dismissal, the cutter too cute for Zampa and it's catching practice for Miller on the edge of the circle"

233,"5.15pm: There was some crackle and pop in that innings. Australia roared off, collapsed in the face of Andile Lucky Phehlukwayo, regrouped through blue-collar fifties from George Bailey and John Hastings and then stumbled at the end... but have they got enough? There have only been a couple of higher pursuits on the ground, but one of them was in South Africa's"
234,David Miller is next in but the batsmen crossed... What can Quinny finish on?
235,"Boland to Duminy, FOUR runs Duminy isn't standing on ceremony for his team-mate, steps forward and launches Boland inside out over cover, that will bounce away, too... The maths are no longer in de Kock's favour"

237,"Boland to de Kock, OUT dug in again, de Kock hooks hard - but this time it's his undoing!

Centurion stands for the centurion, he gets some handshakes on his way off. A quite brilliant innings that has made a difficult chase look si"

245,"Marsh to Behardien, no run bumper to finish the over, Behardien ducks it. Perhaps he wants to savour this one"
