0,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run the first ball swings away, Jayawadene goes after it, and is beaten. To be fair to Jayawardene, the length was there to be driven"
1,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run nearly played on! This one doesn't swing, and hence the inside edge from Jayawardene. Misses the stumps, though"
2,"Lee to Dilshan, no run more swing for Lee, a loose little poke by Dilshan. Beaten"
3,"Lee to Dilshan, 1 run Drama! Lovely bouncer, right at Dilshan's throat. He gets a a limp top edge, which falls towards square leg, within Lee's reach. Lee runs off for the catch, but collides with Jayawardene who is taking the single. No question of obstructing the field, though: Jayawardene didn't do it on purpose"
4,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run slower ball, driven to mid-off"
5,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run length ball on the pads, Jayawardene misses out on easy runs. Is hit on the pad"

7,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run premeditated sweep, from outside off, gets a single to short fine"
8,"O'Keefe to Dilshan, 1 run another near played-on dismissal! Dilshan looks to cut this, but the ball hasn't turned enough, and the bottom edge bounces over the stumps"
9,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs beautiful, beautiful shot, makes room, goes inside out, all along the ground, between cover and extra cover"
10,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs this is like the lob winner in tennis, steps down the wicket, and chips it over mid-on, easy does it"
11,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, no run looks for the back-cut, finds backward point"
12,"Lee to Dilshan, 1 run slower bouncer, nicely pulled away, keeps it down by rolling his wrists on it"
13,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Jayawardene is off to a quick start, this is just a touch too straight, and he muscles it wide of deep square leg"
14,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run some premeditation here as he looks to make room. lee goes full and outside off. Jayawardene ends up swinging inside the line"
15,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs this is top batting. A slower ball from Lee, Jayawardene pauses his shot for a second, then presses play once the ball arrives, cutting it between cover-point and backward point, who are within hand-shaking distance of each other"
16,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run near yorker, on the pads, dug out for a single"
17,"Lee to Dilshan, OUT Given out lbw! Lee is so convinced he doesn't even appeal until he has reached the stumps at the striker's end. This is a length ball, angling into the pads, Dilshan moves across, plays across the line, and misses. My initial reaction was that it might be going down, but I am neither the umpire nor the replay ope"
18,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run good short delivery, Jayawardene looks to turn this to leg, gets a leading edge for a single"
19,"Johnson to Chandimal, no run angled across Chandimal, who cuts without feet movement. Is beaten"

21,"Johnson to Chandimal, 1 run worked off the pads, gets a single wide of mid-on"

23,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run back of a length, outside off, pushed to mid-off for a quick single. Johnson puts in a superb dive to back this wild throw up, from Warner at mid-off"
24,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run plays the late-cut this time. Johnson at third man gets a bad bounce, but keeps them down to one"
25,"Lee to Chandimal, 1 run low full toss, gets a thick outside edge, towards third man"
26,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Clever cricket... slower bouncer, Jayawardene shapes up for the pull, then withdraws from it, and just as an afterthought, deflects this over the keeper's head. Can't set fields for these"
27,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs poor delivery, and punished accordingly... full toss on the pads, with the fine leg up, flicked past that fielder"

29,"Lee to Chandimal, FOUR runs Chandimal joins the party. Gets under a length ball and lofts it over mid-off - 15 off the over"
30,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Toying around with the bowlers here... Another length ball, outside off, and he drives it with an open face, deliberately over point"
31,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs this is even better because this is along the ground, and pierces the five-men cover ring. Slightly slower delivery, waits for it, and cuts it in front of square, between cover and extra cover"
32,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs sensational stuff, and yet not a hint of violence. Punches this on the up, and bisects cover and extra cover. Those five men can just stand and watch"
33,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run angled wide outside off, Jayawardene misses the line this time. That's some respite for Australia"
34,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run goes over the cover ring this time, one bounce to sweeper-cover"
35,"Johnson to Chandimal, no run full and wide outside off, beats Chandimal's attempt to squirt it past point"
36,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs and accordingly Jayawardene exploits the deep-set fields by playing softly, and wide of long-on for two"
37,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, no run sharp turn this time, beats Jayawardene's attempt to run it down"
38,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, no run the arm ball, played back to O'Keefe off the inside half of the bat"
39,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run short and wide, cut away to sweeper-cover"
40,"O'Keefe to Chandimal, 1 run drops this into the on side for a single"
41,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run pushed into the on side for another single"
42,"Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run short and wide, cut away into front of square. Gets just the single. Will think he has missed out on this gift"
43,"Smith to Chandimal, no run fuller legbreak, Chandimal looks to turn this to leg, ends up playing it back to the bowler"
44,"Smith to Chandimal, 2 runs flatter, into the pads, punched away square, gets a couple for it"
45,"Smith to Chandimal, FOUR runs unfortunate for Australia. Chandimal skips out of the crease, doesn't quite get to the pitch, but the thick edge goes fine of short third man. No slip obviously"
46,"Smith to Chandimal, OUT His tendency to play to leg has got him! For the second time in this over he tries to work a legbreak to from well outside off to the leg side. Gets a healthy leading edge that carries to Smith"
47,"Smith to Perera, 1 run full, outside off, clears the front leg, and muscles this to long-on for one"
48,"Johnson to Perera, no run length ball, around off, played to straight extra cover"
49,"Johnson to Perera, FOUR runs slower ball, hit on the up, powerful shot, towards long-on, where O'Keefe misfields and costs Australia three runs"
50,"Johnson to Perera, 2 runs nothing going Australia's way. This is a good bouncer, but the top edge clears the wicketkeeper who is running back. John Hastings, though, makes a good save running from fine leg to behind the keeper, and relays it to Watson"
51,"Johnson to Perera, 2 runs length ball, and Perera has hit the leather off this. Good job by Johnson to get a hand to it, but it still needs some chasing by O'Keefe from long-on, to keep them down to two"
52,"Johnson to Perera, OUT the short ball does the job for Johnson. This is just outside off, shoulder-high, and Perera upper-cuts this one straight down Watson's throat at third man"
53,"Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs and the lady luck continues to tease Australia. This is a good offcutter outside off, gets a thick edge from Mahela, and beats third man who is pretty square. That's fifty for Mahela too"
54,"Smith to Sangakkara, 1 run full, outside off, flicked into the on side"
55,"Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, no run Huge huge appeal for lbw, this is the straighter one, and beats Mahela's attempt to work it to leg. Pitched in front of middle, hits him in front of middle and leg. Slightly unlucky to not get that"
56,"Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, SIX runs top shot again, moves across early, gets on a knee, and plays the regulation sweep in the air, and over the square leg fieldsman"
57,"Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, no run"
58,"Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run plays the reverse paddle now, can't beat the short third man this time"
59,"Smith to Sangakkara, 2 runs overpitched, outside off, driven down to long-on"

68,"O'Keefe to Sangakkara, 1 run chips down the track and plays the chip shot towards deep midwicket"
69,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs bee-you-tee-full shot... this is not driving length, and he just chips it non-violently over extra cover. the ball teases both long-off and sweeper-cover, and eludes both"
70,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run clipped off the pads for one"
71,"O'Keefe to Sangakkara, 2 runs gets a bottom edge on this sweep, which goes between his leg, and very fine on the leg side"

78,"Hastings to Sangakkara, 1 run back of a length, punched down to long-on for one - just the four of this over, one of them a leg-bye"
79,"Smith to Sangakkara, SIX runs Sangakkara! Charges at Smith, not quite to the pitch of the ball, but goes ahead with the slog sweep. Flat, flat six accrues"

84,"Smith to Sangakkara, 1 run low full toss, it is mis-hit towards long-on, but doesn't carry to the fielder"
85,"Hastings to Sangakkara, OUT Duke has got a wicket here. Just back of a length, Sanga manufactures the pull shot, hits it powerfully too, but straight to White at midwicket. The captain contributes"
86,"Hastings to Jeevan Mendis, no run angled across him, Mendis plays an uncertain cut, is beaten"

89,"Hastings to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 leg bye Jayawardene walks right across the stumps, hit in front of the stumps, but this could just be going over the stumps. Leg-bye conceded"
90,"Hastings to Jeevan Mendis, OUT Super stuff from Hastings, this could be a big over in the final equation. This is pitched middle and leg, and headed to just outside off, Mendis tries the chop towards third man, gets the bottom edge onto the stumps. Duke: 12 balls, 4 runs, 2 wickets"

103,"Hastings to Perera, no run good short ball, just outside off, Perera looks to play the punch - too ambitious for a No. 8. Beaten"
104,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs nicely placed between long-on and deep midwicket for two"
105,"O'Keefe to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run leading edge from Mahela as he looks to turn this to leg, but it goes desperately wide of O'Keefe"

116,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, (no ball) perhaps that's why I am not the captain.. this is a high full toss, Mahela opens the face on it, and hits it straight down short third man's throat. Mahela is in no hurry to walk off, he wants the height of this full toss checked. Replays suggest this is slightly higher than his waits, but his"
117,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs and here salt enters the wounds... length ball on the pads, and he has flicked it square for four"
118,"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT some luck finally for Australia. This is a length ball on the pads, the kind T20 batsmen hit for sixes blindfolded. Mahela, though, gets too much under it, and finds deep midwicket"

126,"Kulasekara to Watson, no run huge belter of a shout from Sangakkara, he was headed well down the leg side himself as this was swinging down d down the leg side, but boy did he let that appeal rip? Correctly called not out because of the huge swing. It his him in front of middle"

138,"Kulasekara to Warner, FOUR runs short ball, bread and butter for Warner, pulled along the ground for four"
139,"Kulasekara to Warner, 1 run back of a length, pushed to mid-on for a quick single"
140,"Kulasekara to Watson, FOUR runs shot... beautiful cover-drive, on the up, along the ground, and rickets between cover and extra cover. This wasn't even driving length"
141,"Kulasekara to Watson, no run full ball, hit straight to midwicket"
142,"Kulasekara to Watson, FOUR runs Lovely lovely shot... violent but good to watch. Hit on the up, absolutely murdered between the bowler and the stumps. All along the ground"

166,"Mendis to Warner, OUT My word. We need a new scoring entry for this. Caught Jayawardene b Mendis simply won't do! Sit down and hear this out. Warner slog-sweeps this, Mathews takes the catch at the edge of midwicket boundary, but just as he is about to run over the fence with his momentum, he throws the ball back in - both his feet"
