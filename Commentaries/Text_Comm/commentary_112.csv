14,"Swepson to Buttler, 1 run Roy has dropped his bat, has he been run out?! He may just have got his foot in! Yes, he's safe. He dropped his bat as he got towards the crease, but his momentum was enough to get him home. Buttler had inside-edge a full delivery to short fine leg. All safe in the end"

23,"Kane Richardson to Buttler, FOUR runs opts to try the shorter ball, it's the same result! Banged into pitch, Buttler waits for it then flat-bats it high over mid-off. Not far from carrying for six. An over of wonderful batting from Buttler. His full range"

37,"Stanlake to Roy, 1 run back of a length, pushed into midwicket, a tight run. Close with a hit from Finch"
38,"Stanlake to Buttler, no run safe! There's a collision. A top edge pull, loops to the on side. Stanlake tries to get across and collides with Roy, while Finch can't get in from mid-on. Think Finch thought about asking for obstruction, but Roy didn't change direction on purpose"
39,"Stanlake to Buttler, SIX runs wonderful strike...six over cover! A full delivery, at the stumps, he gives himself a touch of room and it's a skimming drive into the crowd. What power"
40,"Stanlake to Buttler, FOUR runs beats the keeper with a scoop, and that's England's fastest T20I fifty. A short delivery, he gets inside the line and just manages to get it wide of a diving Carey"

52,"Swepson to Buttler, OUT that's a massive drag down, but it's found deep midwicket! Swepson gets his first wicket. By accident or design, it's worked for the leggie. Didn't quite come off the surface, Buttler couldn't get the leverage he needed and it's a simple catch near the rope"
53,"Swepson to Morgan, 1 wide pushes this across wide outside off and it's called wide"
54,"Swepson to Morgan, 2 runs a straighter delivery, short of a length, pulled through midwicket and the sweepers can't stop the second"

59,"Stanlake to Hales, 1 run short of a length outside off, angled down to third man"
60,"Stanlake to Morgan, SIX runs he goes full, and that was probably a mistake! Morgan is moving around his crease, then gets back into line and clips it out to deep midwicket. Sweet timing. It's all action!"
61,"Kane Richardson to Hales, FOUR runs short outside off, a bit of a freebie, and it's put away with a powerful square drive through point"

96,"Kane Richardson to Hales, no run appeal for caught behind...give not out and they call the review. There was a noise. A very wide ball, Hales move across his crease and drove and it. Did bat hit the ground? Yes, looks like bat hit the ground if anything. Daylight between bat and ball"
97,"Kane Richardson to Hales, 1 run full toss, at the stumps, sliced to third man"

100,"Tye to Root, 1 run worked to deep square"

118,"Tye to Bairstow, 1 leg bye excellent stuff, a dipping slow ball, swinging across the line...an appeal for lbw, heading leg side perhaps"
119,"Tye to Root, 1 run low full toss, can only cloth the drive towards mid-off who is inside the circle"
120,"Tye to Bairstow, OUT all sorts of a mess here! Root is run out. Bairstow is completely defeated by a slower short ball, it loops through to Carey and is aware that Root is charging up for the bye and that's end to aim for. Lobs the ball to Tye to completes the work"
121,"Tye to Bairstow, SIX runs well, that makes up a little for the first five deliveries of the over! Just can't quite nail the yorker, it's a slower ball at off stump, Bairstow is able to get under it and heaves it miles back over long-on"
122,"So England finish with 221 for 5, not quite a record for them but one heck of an innings. The last two overs were pretty good for Australia, just two boundaries (both sixes) but overall England were motoring throughout. Jos Buttler set the tone opening the innings, then it was followed by Alex Hales and Joe Root. Kane Richardson had"
123,"England are in a huddle on the edge of the field, and here come the Australian openers, Aaron Finch and D'Arcy Short. David Willey has the new ball"

144,"Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs pummelled high and mightily out towards deep extra cover... two men gallop back but the ball just eludes them!"
145,"Jordan to Maxwell, (no ball) a sharp bouncer, but it's been called for an over-step, rather than on height. A free hit coming up"

155,"Willey to Head, 1 wide a bit of a rubbish delivery, down the leg side. We'll have that one again"
156,"Willey to Head, 1 run steps out to the leg side this time and connects with a slog to deep midwicket"

216,"Rashid to Agar, 1 run googly, hauled down to long-on"
217,"Rashid to Tye, SIX runs banjaxed into the stands! Deep in the crease, clears the front leg, and pounds it over cow corner!"
218,"Rashid to Tye, 1 run smashed down the ground, Jordan gathers on the bounce to end a fine match-defining spell"
219,"Willey to Tye, 1 run drilled out to the off side"
220,"Willey to Agar, 1 wide wide outside off, but that looks a bit of a harsh call. Right on the guideline"
221,"Willey to Agar, no run very well targetted this time, another wide yorker, half an inch to the good"
222,"Willey to Agar, 1 run turns his stance inside out in a bid to take on the three fielders on the leg side, but can't get enough bat on the ball"
223,"Willey to Tye, 1 run swished to the leg side, finds the man at short fine leg"
224,"Willey to Agar, 1 run wide line once more, a slower ball, clipped down the ground. This has been a fine over, and Australia's challenge is fizzling out"
225,"Willey to Tye, 1 run low full toss on a wide line once more, clothed to deep midwicket. Australia need boundaries"
226,"Jordan to Tye, 1 run low full toss, but arrow-straight. Morgan gathered at cover, and had time to nail his shy. That would have been out!"
227,"Jordan to Swepson, no run full and straight, but Swepson the debutant responds with a firm defensive push"
228,"Jordan to Swepson, 1 run crashed hard into the covers, but just the single"
229,"Jordan to Tye, 2 runs low full toss, can't do much with that, punched straight, and Jordan's day's work is done"
230,"Willey to Swepson, 1 run round the wicket, right into the blockhole"
231,"Willey to Tye, no run wide full toss, can't reach with a swing and a miss"
232,"Willey to Tye, SIX runs ... but sixes still keep them alive! This one is massive, in the slot for a swing back down the ground"
233,"Willey to Swepson, 1 run a flashing drive to deep extra cover"
234,"Willey to Stanlake, 1 run wide yorker to finish, he's bowled that line very well. Chopped to point and Willey completes a fine evening's work"
235,"Plunkett to Stanlake, no run banged in short, Stanlake ducks"
236,"Plunkett to Stanlake, 1 wide a swish down the leg side"
237,"Plunkett to Stanlake, no run another bouncer, another air shot. Stanlake, for all his talent as a bowler, strikes me as a very traditional No.11. And hurrah for that, they are a dying breed"
238,"Plunkett to Stanlake, SIX runs in the slot and slogged over cow corner! Like Devon Malcolm at Sydney 1994! He's got levers you know!"
239,"9.41pm It's been clinical from England. A tremendous continuation of their power-hitting approach at the top of their innings, and a ruthless closure of the contest with the ball, particularly from the leggie Adil Rashid. Aaron Finch battled gamely in a captain's knock, but it's been one-way traffic on a desperate tour for the Aussi"
240,"""To have close to our full-strength team is very exciting, and the public enjoy watching them perform."""
241,"""Mixing it up is part of my game. Finchy was going well, but Morgs gives all the bowlers confidence. No regrets about giving up red-ball cricket. It's something I'm happy with."""
242,"10pm So that's a wrap from Edgbaston. On the day that Germany crashed out of the World Cup, England have sent their oldest cricketing foes home without a crumb of comfort. It's been quite the week for English sport... Next stop, it's India. See you then."
243,England won by 28 runs
244,"Player of the match is Adil Rashid, ENG"
