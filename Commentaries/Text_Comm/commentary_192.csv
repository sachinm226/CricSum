0,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, no run left alone outside off. Decent line and the merest hint of away movement"
1,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, no run outside off and Guptil swings and misses. A gimme, really"
2,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, FOUR runs comes forward, opens the face and edges it down to the vacant third-man boundary for the first runs, and boundary, of the match"
3,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, FOUR runs short and he's muscled this! Front-foot pull through mid-on. Typical Guptil. All upper-body strength and power"
4,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, 1 run on his legs and flicked for a single. Could've got two, actually, but Williamson sends Guptil back"
5,"Coulter-Nile to Williamson, no run shorter this time and Kane's on the back foot, defending with his usual imperviousness"
6,"Watson to Guptill, no run Watto's first ball is right on the money and defended"
7,"Watson to Guptill, no run again, on the off stump and Guptil clamps down on it, head over the ball"
8,"Watson to Guptill, no run excellent line, this. A touch outside off with a hint of movement away from Guptil, who is forward and defending"
9,"Watson to Guptill, 1 run so close to dragging on! Guptil's onto this shorter ball and gets a thin under edge which evades stumps and keeper"
10,"Watson to Williamson, FOUR runs a waste from Watson and Williamson just tucks this leg-side stray off his toes for four. Easy"
11,"Watson to Williamson, no run Watson yelps an appeal as Williamson's rapped on the pads via an inside edge. Watson retracts his yelp and the umpire doesn't even bother looking at the outrageous appeal"
12,"Agar to Guptill, SIX runs Wellington Boots, that's enormous. An horrific full toss and Guptil mullers it over long-on for a 92-metre monster"
13,"Agar to Guptill, SIX runs and again! Identical to the previous delivery - another full-bunger and Guptil heaves it, muscles it for another six"
14,"Agar to Guptill, no run Agar's landed this one and Guptil tucks him to leg for a single. No! Sent back."
15,"Agar to Guptill, no run hit with terrifying power back to Agar who stops it neatly with a tumble"
16,"Agar to Guptill, no run far better line, just outside off, and full enough too. Blocked"
17,"Agar to Guptill, SIX runs it's big, it's solid, it's six. Good grief, this Agar experiment has been met with a shake of the head from Smith as Guptil murders him over his head for six more"
18,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run tucked off his pads to wide fine leg for a single"
19,"Watson to Guptill, no run shorter, and Guptil attempts another pull but picks out short midwicket"
20,"Watson to Guptill, no run a really good line and length here from Watson, just outside off, and Guptil's in two minds whether to run that to third man or not. Defended."
21,"Watson to Guptill, no run just outside off and defended"
22,"Watson to Guptill, 1 run timed the pants off that, a solid punch off the back foot behind square - Maxwell fields beautifully to save two"
23,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run rides the bounce and punchily defended to mid-off...and they steal a single thanks to a mishap. Bit careless from mid-off there"
24,"Faulkner to Williamson, no run starts well, on middle, and it's blocked"
25,"Faulkner to Williamson, no run short of a length allowing Williamson to rock back, but it cuts back on him marginally and Kane defends"
26,"Faulkner to Williamson, no run very good deliver, tempting him outside off. Williamson is so solid in defence, though, that he comes forward with solidarity to block it out"
27,"Faulkner to Williamson, FOUR runs sweetly struck - just a touch fuller from Faulkner and Williamson chips it over mid-on for four. Not timed as well as he might, perhaps, but elegantly dispatched"
28,"Faulkner to Williamson, FOUR runs so close to a midwicket-stunning-catch! Didn't see who. Williamson clipped it powerfully off his toes and it only just evaded midwicket's dive"
29,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run a turn of the wrists brings Williamson a single to square leg"
30,"Coulter-Nile to Williamson, 1 run shorter ball, rides up on him and he turns it off his hip"
31,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, 1 run angled down to third man"
32,"Coulter-Nile to Williamson, 1 run flicks this off his pads. Good length but too straight"
33,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, SIX runs shot! That is delicious. Down the pitch and smacked with a golf-swing over the top for six. Utter power"
34,"Coulter-Nile to Guptill, 1 run if only you could hear the noise that shot made. A wonderful crack off the bat as he pulls this - but picks out the man at deep square leg"
35,"Coulter-Nile to Williamson, FOUR runs oh, this is sweet - the game's first classy shot. It's a loose stray outside off from NCN and Williamson comes forward before opening the face, timing it beautifully to a wide third man for four"
36,"Zampa to Guptill, 1 run well he starts better than Agar did, though too short and down the leg-side. Swept for a single"
37,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run better line, on middle-and-leg, muscled past Zampa who looks peeved that he couldn't stop it"
38,"Zampa to Guptill, no run down the leg side, swept but it balloons up in the air to the keeper who roars an appeal. Nowhere near the bat though - off his pads"
39,"Zampa to Guptill, no run clonked back to the bowler"
40,"Zampa to Guptill, 1 run ah well bowled - flatter and quicker as Guptil came down the pitch to him"
41,"Zampa to Williamson, no run turns him round a bit there - Williamson's neither forward or back, defending this full, leg-side ball and it squirts out to cover"
42,"Faulkner to Guptill, OUT oh, he's holed out - short of a length and Guptil goes on the pull but picks out Maxwell at long-on who runs around the boundary and takes a good, low catch while on the move. Smartly pouched"
43,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run pushed out off the back foot for a single. Think about two but, no. Two would be silly."
44,"Faulkner to Munro, 1 run solidly punched to mid-off and Agar's asleep - his fumble bringing a single"
45,"Faulkner to Williamson, no run good line, tucked off his toes but no run on offer"
46,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run short of a length. Williamson moves to leg before punching it out to cover"
47,"Faulkner to Munro, 1 run another single to poor old Agar, though this time he collects it and wings back in a throw. Can't prevent the single"
48,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run Munro opens his shoulders and smacks it to long-off with disparaging intent"
49,"Maxwell to Williamson, OUT Kane's gone! Williamson stepped to leg and tried to smash it for six over the top, but miscues a skier to Agar - Agar! - who takes it comfortably"
50,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run fired in flat and fast. Munro punches out to cover"
51,"Maxwell to Anderson, no run again fast and again flat, on off, and solidly blocked"
52,"Maxwell to Anderson, 1 run tickled off his toes for a cheeky single"
53,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run too short and flicked through midwicket for a jogged single"
54,"Marsh to Munro, 1 wide piffle. Wide, wide, wide of off"
55,"Marsh to Munro, 1 run Munro stands tall and with long levers powers this to long-off"
56,"Marsh to Anderson, 1 run short of a length, Anderson - who looks like the front cover of a Playstation game, playing the action hero - swivels onto a pull"
57,"Marsh to Munro, 1 run comes forward but there's more bounce than he realises, and it's pushed out just short of a diving cover! Coulter-Nile so nearly dives forward to cling on but grasses it"
58,"Marsh to Anderson, no run defended solidly"
59,"Marsh to Anderson, 1 run driven solidly to long-on"
60,"Marsh to Munro, 1 run edged! An ugly cross-batted swipe from Munro and he gets an under-edge to the keeper. Or in fact, through the keeper's legs for a single"
61,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run ooh, Munro's down the pitch but can't get more than a single - crashed to long-off"
62,"Maxwell to Anderson, OUT Maxwell's done it again! Anderson's down the pitch, tries to clear long-off but Agar is hovering. He's skied this miles, and Agar's in position and takes it comfortably...on his knees, hands in front of his face, as though imploring the ball into his palm"
63,"Maxwell to Munro, no run opens the face and smacks it to point"
64,"Maxwell to Munro, 2 runs reverse-hit to deep extra cover"
65,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run down the pitch to a fuller, but leg-side, delivery and clumped out to long-on"
66,"Maxwell to Taylor, no run nicely bowled, fired in on middle and he's defending this to mid-on"
67,"Watson to Munro, no run short of a length, Munro is in an awful position really - tries to slap this to mid-off? I'm not even sure what he was trying, but the ball is wellied out to cover with no power"
68,"Watson to Munro, no run down the pitch and Munro, sporting chewing gum and an active jaw motion, smacks it into the ground back to Watto. Shane leaps, collects, then shies a throw at the stumps, as is his wont"
69,"Watson to Munro, no run a bouncer. Munro's not interested"
70,"Watson to Munro, 1 run ooooh that's a naughty single, very naughty. Coulter Nile picks it up at mid-off and under-arms a return while on the move, but misses"
71,"Watson to Taylor, 1 run turned off his pads for a single"
72,"Watson to Munro, 1 run fuller from Watson and timed, nicely, for a single past mid-on"
73,"Maxwell to Munro, FOUR runs switch, reverse, paddle! Remarkable stroke really - switched to a right-hander before dabbing it to fine leg (or third man) for four"
74,"Maxwell to Munro, 1 run pulled off his hip for a single"
75,"Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run fast, full, straight and Taylor steals a single to mid-off"
76,"Maxwell to Munro, no run tossed up - really gave this a lot of air - but Munro picks out a very short mid-off"
77,"Maxwell to Munro, FOUR runs switch-hit podcast! Munro switches to become a right-hander and, staying low, pulls this for four. Remarkable power"
78,"Maxwell to Munro, 4 byes this spins past Munro's ugly heave, beating him and the keeper for four."
79,"Marsh to Taylor, no run what a ball! An absolute corker from Marsh. Shaped in to the right-hander before straightening, beating his forward defensive. Beautifully bowled"
80,"Marsh to Taylor, 1 run crashed out to deep extra cover"
81,"Marsh to Munro, no run good line and length. Munro looks annoyed with himself as he picks out cover"
82,"Marsh to Munro, no run again, very good length from Marsh - full, but not a half-volley, leaving Munro in two minds whether to go forward or back. All he can do is defend back to Marsh"
83,"Marsh to Munro, no run this is class from Marsh, a slower-ball off-cutter. Munro's all at sea and mis-reads it, stepping to leg and missing it completely"
84,"Marsh to Munro, OUT got him! Top, top class from Marsh - he's frustrated Munro for an over and an impetuous, angry, ill-advised front-footed pull picks out deep midwicket who clings on"
85,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, no run on his legs and clipped again to leg"
86,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, 1 run full, but too straight and Elliott's picking him off to leg for a single"
87,"Coulter-Nile to Taylor, no run Taylor's forward, then back, pushing out to cover"
88,"Coulter-Nile to Taylor, 1 run sharp, sharp single by Taylor, dropping out to short-extra and he's out of the blocks quick enough to nick one"
89,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, no run plays and misses outside off"
90,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, no run that's really well bowled - a touch wider of the crease from NCN, fired in to off stump"
91,"Marsh to Taylor, no run on his legs but a clip finds mid-on"
92,"Marsh to Taylor, 1 run an ugly cross-batted flog to leg and only for a single"
93,"Marsh to Elliott, FOUR runs scooter! Elliott dances down the pitch - prances - but it's fired down the leg side and misses him, keeper and everyone"
94,"Marsh to Elliott, no run short of a length and punched back to Mitchell McGrath"
95,"Marsh to Elliott, 2 runs an elegant punch off the back foot for a couple, but New Zealand need more. Muscle. Power. Boundaries..."
96,"Marsh to Elliott, 1 run down the pitch and here's some intent, but he's actually lucky not to pick out deep midwicket - a front-footed pull gets him one"
97,"Watson to Elliott, 2 runs inside edge! So close to dragging on and he may get four here, but it's well cleaned up by fine-leg who runs round"
98,"Watson to Elliott, 1 run shorter and slower and Elliott misreads it. On the pull but it's wellied with no power to midwicket"
99,"Watson to Taylor, 1 wide shame from Watto - slower ball off-cutter but it's down the leg side"
100,"Watson to Taylor, SIX runs oh hello - that is, at last, a true monster from Taylor as he steps to off and clatters it over midwicket for six! What a hit. What a sound off the bat"
101,"Watson to Taylor, OUT he's gone for it again but straight to Marsh at midwicket! Clever bowling from Watson there, actually, as he held it back just a touch"
102,"Watson to Ronchi, no run Ronchi's onto the front foot and driving solidly"
103,"Watson to Ronchi, 1 run outside off and angled down to third man"
104,"Marsh to Ronchi, 1 run short of a length and angled out behind square off the back foot"
105,"Marsh to Elliott, FOUR runs superb stroke - stepped right outside leg, showing all three stumps (and another set too), crashing it through cover for four"
106,"Marsh to Elliott, no run attempts a similar shot but misses"
107,"Marsh to Elliott, 1 run on the pull! But mistimes it and finds deep midwicket"
108,"Marsh to Ronchi, 1 run comes forward, though it's a touch shorter than he anticipated, and it's punched out to cover for a well-run single"
109,"Marsh to Elliott, FOUR runs shorter still from Marsh and at a comfortable height for Elliott who swivels onto a pull for four"
110,"Faulkner to Ronchi, 1 run back onto his stumps and chipped to leg"
111,"Faulkner to Elliott, no run ha, Elliott tries to hit this into China! Slower ball and misses it completely."
112,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run too leg-sidey and flicked off his hip to a short fine-leg"
113,"Faulkner to Ronchi, 2 runs comes down the track, stepping outside leg and carves it over cover - could've gone anywhere but somehow lands safely"
114,"Faulkner to Ronchi, OUT mistimes this completely, trying to hit over midwicket but finds Maxwell coming in from deep midwicket, who's about as safe a pair of hands as you can find, and he takes a smart, athletic take low by his laces"
115,"Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run a bizarre punch off the back foot, while stepping to leg, only gets him one"
116,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, 2 runs Elliott muscles this over midwicket, again not timing it, but enough to get him two"
117,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, 2 runs steps to the off side and tries to scoop it, but ends up toe-ending a pull to midwicket. They run for a single - no, two! This should be out if it hits but, no, Smith's ballsed it up and they get two"
118,"Coulter-Nile to Elliott, 1 run on the pull once more, but cannons into his legs"
119,"Coulter-Nile to Santner, 1 run, OUT outside off, he carves it out to deep extra cover boundary for...one? Or two. Two, but it's Maxwell patrolling the boundary and sends in a bullet throw - what a throw! And he looks to be short"
120,"Coulter-Nile to Milne, 2 runs monster pull - the sound of that reverberated around the ground but it falls short of Maxwell"
121,"Coulter-Nile to Milne, OUT an ugly heave-ho - think 1990s Devon Malcolm swing-and-a-miss - and it passes through to the keeper, who wings in a throw and demolishes the stumps to end the innings"
122,"Australia's seamers in particular have been outstanding; the pitch sticky and slow, very difficult to time the ball. But we all thought New Zealand's innings against India wasn't nearly enough, didn't we? Join us shortly for Australia's chase."
123,"Don't forget, we have England v South Africa (preview) a little later. Alan Gardner's heading up comms for that, so direct all demands for comment-publishing to him."
124,"The Kiwis are on the boundary rope getting a talking-to from the coach, and we're nearly ready to rock. Cloudier than earlier but still fine, and no rain on the radar until much later."
125,Anderson to begin over the wicket
126,"Anderson to Khawaja, no run very full and a touch of swing away from the left-hander who drives out to cover"
127,"Anderson to Khawaja, FOUR runs shot, shot - too straight from Anderson and short enough for Usman to swivel and pound this with beautiful timing through midwicket"
128,"Anderson to Khawaja, 1 run short again - too short - and the left-hander cuts past point but just for a single"
129,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run on his legs and tucked for a single"
130,"Anderson to Khawaja, FOUR runs beautiful! Lovely, elegant, Goweresque and flowing drive through the covers for four"
131,"Anderson to Khawaja, 1 run edged down to third man"
132,"Milne to Khawaja, no run short of a length and tries to clatter this through the covers but gets an inside edge to the leg side"
133,"Milne to Khawaja, FOUR runs he's flying here. A bit uppish perhaps but he's buzzing with confidence and picks up this half-volley over mid-on - just over - for four more"
134,"Milne to Khawaja, no run on the pull but misses it completely"
135,"Milne to Khawaja, FOUR runs absolutely nailed a cut for four but it's a gift from Milne, floating outside off and Usman, in this mood, needs no second invitation. He really has timed the underwear off that"
136,"Milne to Khawaja, no run bowled. Faster, fuller, straighter. Defended"
137,"Milne to Khawaja, 1 run a lovely flowing drive, once more, but to mid-off"
138,"Elliott to Khawaja, no run fired in on the off stump, pushed out to nmid-off"
139,"Elliott to Khawaja, FOUR runs smash! On the up from Khawaja, reminded me of Saeed Anwar, flogging it over cover"
140,"Elliott to Khawaja, 1 run straighter this time and flicked to leg with wristy impunity"
141,"Elliott to Watson, FOUR runs well, four more. I'm afraid that's just poor bowling. Short, wide and crunched"
142,"Elliott to Watson, no run much fuller this time and straighter, too."
143,"Elliott to Watson, 1 run a stolen single and Australia are marching ahead"
144,"McClenaghan to Watson, 1 run straight, straight enough for a whip off his legs"
145,"McClenaghan to Khawaja, no run so close! McClenaghan's throaty appeal demands the umpire to take a look as he wraps the left-hander on the pads. It cut back sharply but ... just going over the top, we feel"
146,"McClenaghan to Khawaja, FOUR runs dismissive! Absolutely dismissive. Khawaja sees this shorter delivery and cracks it beautifully on one leg over midwicket for four"
147,"McClenaghan to Khawaja, 1 run a much, much better length - more of that, New Zealand. Touch slower too, and Usman can only turn it to leg for a single"
148,"McClenaghan to Watson, 1 run Watto turns it to mid-on and he's in trouble here if this hits. Anderson - ah, no! A fumble at mid-on"
149,"McClenaghan to Khawaja, no run slower ball outside off, angled to short third man"
150,"Anderson to Watson, no run angled into middle and straightening a touch, clumped to mid-on. Can't get hold of it."
151,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run good line again, but powerfully punched by Watson back to the bowler who's forced to block it from smacking into his face. Not quite sure how he misread that"
152,"Anderson to Khawaja, 1 run another of Khawaja walking flicks, as he takes this from outside off through midwicket"
153,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run Watson's pulling this shorter delivery which causes a lot of excitement in the crowd, before realising he didn't get hold of it at all"
154,"Anderson to Khawaja, 1 run reasonably outrageous walking-smash to mid-on is mistimed"
155,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run ooh, inside edge as he tries to cut this but it's much too full. Lucky not to drag it on"
156,"McClenaghan to Watson, 2 runs elegantly on-driven here for two"
157,"McClenaghan to Smith, no run well bowled! Another slowy and it deceives Smith who plays and misses"
158,"McClenaghan to Smith, FOUR runs crikey moses, he has timed that quite superbly. Textbook cover drive. No more need be said."
159,"McClenaghan to Smith, 2 runs too full and Smith's turning this for two off his twinkly toes"
160,"Santner to Khawaja, 1 run drops this a bit too short and Usman cuts hard to the man on the deep point boundary"
161,"Santner to Smith, no run down the pitch and gets a leading edge to mid-off"
162,"Santner to Smith, no run oh, well bowled - touch slower and Smith is very, very cautiously defending. Almost squared up"
163,"Santner to Warner, no run defends his first delivery"
164,"Santner to Warner, 1 run this is too short, allowing Warner to rock back and time it past point"
165,"Williamson to Warner, no run plays and misses! Lovely flight, dip and turn"
166,"Williamson to Warner, 1 run straighter, and Warner turns to leg"
167,"Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run full toss, clumped for a single to long-on"
168,"Williamson to Warner, no run gives this a lot of flight and Warner eyes up a cover-drive, stepping to leg but only timing it to cover"
169,"Williamson to Warner, 1 run Warner, who is energetic and busy already, clips to leg"
170,"Williamson to Khawaja, no run short of a length, Usman rocks back and cuts"
171,"Elliott to Warner, 1 run too short and pulled, without timing, to long-on"
172,"Elliott to Khawaja, 2 runs lovely timing here - shorter delivery and it does rise a touch on the left-hander, but he times this nicely wide of long-on"
173,"Elliott to Khawaja, no run outside off, angled to third man"
174,"Elliott to Khawaja, 2 runs another walking flick from Khawaja who turns this through midwicket, elegantly so"
175,"Elliott to Khawaja, 1 run ooh, catch is the cry, but Elliott can't reach it - Khawaja goes on the pull but, for possibly the first time today, mistimes it and it lobs past the bowler"
176,"Elliott to Warner, 1 run, OUT driven powerfully down the ground for a single - no, they'll take two. They'll have to be quick, mind - he's out! Khawaja's short! A brilliant throw from the deep and Usman's not the quickest, and is an inch short"
177,"Sodhi to Maxwell, 1 run leg-side stray"
178,"Sodhi to Warner, no run well bowled - the wrong-un outside off. Warner misreads it"
179,"Sodhi to Warner, 1 run Warner more confidently onto the front foot and tapping it through midwicket"
180,"Sodhi to Maxwell, no run excellent leggie's line, just outside off and drifting further into middle. Maxwell is cautiously forward"

182,"Sodhi to Maxwell, no run another very good ball tossed up on middle-and-off, and defended"
183,"Santner to Marsh, no run slower, given much more air and solidly defended on the front foot"
184,"Santner to Marsh, 1 run outside off, cut to deep extra cover. Santner's control is excellent, as is his ability to alter his pace"
185,"Santner to Maxwell, no run beauty, a corker - beat him with the spin, which turned past Maxwell, but actually he was done by the pace. Much quicker ball"
186,"Santner to Maxwell, no run a slightly daft reverse-sweep attempt - Santner sees him coming and fires it down the leg side"
187,"Santner to Maxwell, 1 run drops this square for a quick single. They'll have to be quick! And they are - fair play. Well run."
188,"Anderson to Maxwell, no run driven behind square and is this another run-out? No. But their running is shambolic"
189,"Anderson to Maxwell, no run another failed reverse-paddle-cum-sweep"
190,"Anderson to Maxwell, 1 run touch too straight. Maxwell walks into a nurdle"
191,"Anderson to Marsh, no run cracked to point"
192,"Anderson to Marsh, 1 run this is good from Anderson - he's around the wicket, incidentally - and Marsh can only defend for a single"
193,"Anderson to Maxwell, 1 run Maxwell's having a shocker so far - what's he done here? Mistimed pull-cum-flick, ala Ponting actually but without the timing. Skies it short of deep midwicket"
194,"Milne to Maxwell, 1 wide down the leg side. A waste."
195,"Milne to Maxwell, FOUR runs big, floppy, ill-fitting wellington-boots! He's given them some welly and got a humungous inside-edge past the stumps and keeper."
196,"Milne to Maxwell, FOUR runs and another! Love it from Maxwell. Completely mistimes it (or is this on purpose), trying to pull it but gets a huge inside edge"
197,"Milne to Maxwell, 1 wide down the leg side for another wide"
198,"Milne to Maxwell, 1 run stands tall to push this out to cover for a single"
199,"Milne to Marsh, 1 leg bye a touch square up to a better, quicker ball and it balloons out to cover"
200,"Milne to Maxwell, 1 run down the leg side and Maxwell, on the walk, shuffling to leg, shovels it further to leg"
201,"Milne to Marsh, 1 run no timing, no power - much like New Zealand found at this point, too. Marsh steps back and flaps it into the surface"
202,"Sodhi to Marsh, 1 run short, tennis-ball bounce - this pitch really is a pudding. Goes for a pull but mistimes"
203,"Sodhi to Maxwell, no run lovely drift, and grip - he's getting decent spin. Pushed out to the offside"
204,"Sodhi to Maxwell, 1 run down the pitch - it had to happen! - but can't get hold of it, flogging this to leg"
205,"Sodhi to Marsh, no run very, very good line outside off - and again, decent turn. Defended"
206,"Sodhi to Marsh, 1 run marginally shorter and again pushed out to point, but just wide of Santner who is wrong-footed and can't get it back in time"
207,"Sodhi to Maxwell, 1 run reverse-swept, with some power, but not the placement."
208,"Santner to Maxwell, 2 runs turned off his toes for two - placed that nicely"
209,"Santner to Maxwell, no run oops - switches to left-handed mode and, er, well, defends it. He's all of a muddle"
210,"Santner to Maxwell, 1 run another reverse hit, a full-toss, to leg"
211,"Santner to Marsh, SIX runs monster! Ooh, that is fruity - that really is massive, down the pitch and murdering it over long-off. 101m beauty"
212,"Santner to Marsh, 1 run shorter, and pulled without timing but enough for a single"
213,"Santner to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up nicely but his line's off since that six. A single."
214,"Sodhi to Marsh, no run defended out to mid-off"
215,"Sodhi to Marsh, no run this is calm, sensible bowling - outside off, too, once again. Defended to cover"
216,"Sodhi to Marsh, 1 run too short, allowing Marsh to flip it to leg"
217,"Sodhi to Agar, no run the wrong-un almost deceives Agar, but he played it off the pitch and defended"
218,"Sodhi to Agar, no run outside off and blocked once more"
219,"Santner to Marsh, 1 run cracked off the back foot to cover"
220,"Santner to Agar, 1 run turned off middle stump behind square, well - to a short fine leg actually. Scampering brings a single"
221,"Santner to Marsh, no run again this is so well bowled by Santner - sees Marsh charging down the pitch (well, you can hardly miss him) and drops it short and wide"
222,"Santner to Marsh, SIX runs Marsh plants his front foot, winds the levels and lets rip a crunching blow over long-on. He is power."
223,"Santner to Marsh, 1 run pushed out to cover"
224,"Santner to Agar, SIX runs Agar dances down the pitch and clatters an 84m over long-on! Top shot"
225,"Sodhi to Marsh, 1 run smartly clipped but just for a single"
226,"Sodhi to Agar, 1 run short of a length, Agar rocks back and cuts"
