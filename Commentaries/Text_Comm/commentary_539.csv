2,"Steyn to Warner, no run spat off the pitch, a scorcher that, slightly back of a length on the off stump and shot off to evade the outside edge as he tried to defend that off the back foot"
3,"Steyn to Warner, 1 run superb stuff, stopped a bit on Warner, caught him by surprise as it zipped off the wicket, caught the outside edge and flew towards third man, he tried to play that down with soft hands but was a little late on the shot, no damage done though"
