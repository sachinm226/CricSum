2,"Starc to Anamul, no run 143kph, throws his bat at a full, inswinging delivery outside off. No feet whatsoever though and he's beaten soundly"
3,"Starc to Anamul, no run low full toss, think he was going for an indipping yorker there. Anamul drills it to mid-on with a straight bat"
4,"Starc to Anamul, no run cuts him in half again, this time with the batsman charging him. It's just back of a good length and ducks back in at him."

6,"Starc to Anamul, no run another one dug in around the off stump and Anamul uses soft hands to dab it towards point"
7,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, no run full, on and around off stump. Tamim presses forward and drives to mid-off"
8,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, 1 wide poor direction from Coulter-Nile and he's saved a few blushes by a big dive from the keeper. Inswinger goes way down leg"
9,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, no run fires it into the blockhole on middle, Tamim digs it out with an angled bat. Gets a thick outside edge to point"
10,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, 1 wide slower ball, slides down leg again. Two wides in his first over back in the side."
11,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, 1 run 142kph, back of a length on middle and leg, picked away to deep square leg"
12,"Coulter-Nile to Anamul, OUT simple catch at first slip and Anamul succumbs to a very rash shot! Charged him and swung wildly, that's been his gameplan in this little innings, and it ends with a straightforward snick into the cordon. Reward for a fuller length for Coulter-Nile"
13,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, no run back of a length and outside off, steered to point off his toes"
14,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, no run full on off stump, he strides forward and pushes to mid-on"
15,"Starc to Tamim, 1 wide the wide bug bits Starc this time. Presents a lovely, good length ball angled across the right-hander... Only it was Tamim on strike"
16,"Starc to Tamim, no run much better. This time he realises it's a leftie and delivers a back of a length delivery that curls away after pitching. Lures a poke from Tamim and beats him"
17,"Starc to Tamim, no run back-to-back beauties and both of them were shorter in length. Gets a bit of help from the pitch as this seams past the outside edge"

19,"Starc to Tamim, no run dug in short and just a shade outside off, Tamim has seen the line and leaves it"
20,"Starc to Tamim, 3 runs nothing wrong with the ball, but Tamim gains some confidence by a solid front foot push. Held his balance as he punches the good length ball on the up and through the covers"
21,"Starc to Shakib, FOUR runs full and wide outside off and Shakib races down the track and drills it through the covers. His back foot came off the ground as he had to reach out for it"
22,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, no run 142kph, sends a very full and very wide delivery that Tamim rightly goes after with a cover drive. Doesn't connect"
23,"Coulter-Nile to Tamim, OUT good length ball around the off stump, Tamim goes for an on-the-up drive again but this time his timing is terrible. Lobs a low catch to mid-off and departs with his head down. He's not had a very good few months recently and that rut continues"
24,"Coulter-Nile to Mushfiqur, no run 141kph, lovely fuller length fetches a little bit of away swing. Gets a thick outside edge to point"
25,"Coulter-Nile to Mushfiqur, 1 run shortish and a bit of width outside off, he rides it down to third man. Good bounce off this deck"
26,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, no run goes for a lash over the top of the slips, but the bounce on this short ball directed across him is too much"
27,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, no run back of a length on and around off stump, blocked into the covers"

29,"Bollinger to Mushfiqur, no run fullish on and around middle, Mushi presents a straight bat"
30,"Bollinger to Mushfiqur, 1 run movement away and it fetches a bit of an outside edge that wanders past a diving second slip. Australia continue exploring a shortish length and deriving just a hint of seam"
31,"Bollinger to Shakib, SIX runs launced over midwicket! Takes on the bouncer and he's succeeded with some elan! He was on the front foot, but pushed his weight back just enough to swat it away"
32,"Bollinger to Shakib, no run races down the track and looks to heave down the ground, but misses the fuller delivery curving in at him a bit. Misses the middle bail by inches"
33,"Bollinger to Shakib, 1 run shuffles across and nudges this off this thighs to long leg"
34,"Watson to Shakib, no run full on leg stump, Shakib flicks off the front foot but isn't able to beat the lone man at short fine leg. Boundary opportunity goes begging"

36,"Watson to Shakib, no run back of a length on middle, Shakib blocks"
37,"Watson to Shakib, 4 leg byes comes down the track again and though the bowler tries refuses to let him to get under it, Shakib deflects it off his thighs and past the keeper"
38,"Watson to Shakib, SIX runs offers up a length ball outside off and he's been carted over the long-on boundary. Cleared his front leg and slammed it for the 250th six of the tournament"

40,"Maxwell to Shakib, FOUR runs what a welcome! advances to reach the pitch and hosts the flighted ball over the bowler's head."
41,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 run isn't afraid of tossing the ball up despite the last ball. Slower pace keeps Shakib to a defensive nudge into the leg side"
42,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs gets no turn from this angle and he bowls one a little short and wide. Mushi goes back and slaps it into the gap through point. Waited on it nicely and put it away into the gap"
43,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, 1 run picks the good length ball off his pads for a couple through midwicket"
44,"Maxwell to Shakib, no run lovely flight again from Maxi. The batsman is lured forward and slices it to point"
45,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 run tossed up again, pushed into the covers for a single"
46,"Bollinger to Shakib, 1 run comes down the track again, but he strikes this off the bottom of the bat. Fuller delivery outside off dragged to long-on"

50,"Bollinger to Shakib, FOUR runs 133kph, excellent strike! Short ball, but doesn't rise as high as Bollinger wanted. Shakib though is set on the back foot and swivel pulls it down behind the square leg boundary"

54,"Watson to Mushfiqur, no run slower ball, kept full on off stump. Mushi blocks with an open face"
55,"Watson to Mushfiqur, 1 bye races down the track, but Watto's seen him and sends down a short ball outside off. Can't reach it and the keeper fluffs up as well"
56,"Watson to Shakib, no run 135 kph, looks for a dab to third man but this wasn't really short enough or wide enough for that"
57,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run chopes the shortish ball angled in at him to deep third man"
58,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, 1 run too close for a horizontal bat shot, but still manages to tap it down to third man. Not off the middle though"
59,"Coulter-Nile to Mushfiqur, 1 run 141kph, too quick for him there, and a bit of extra bounce too. It was shortish and around the off stump and Mushi was looking for the typically subcontinental flick to midwicket. Gets truck on the glove as the ball has a bit more sting on it"
60,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, 2 runs full on leg stump, but Shakib has played this a little too early. Gets a bit of a leading edge that evades the bowler's left hand"
61,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, FOUR runs what timing! All he did was come down on the ball with a chop, there was no flourish at all. But it easily beats deep third man"
62,"Coulter-Nile to Shakib, 1 run 142kph, that's slipped out of his hands! Rather high full toss gets an outside edge that balloons over cover. That was a smidge over the waist and he's gotten away with it. Instant apology from Coulter-Nile"
63,"Coulter-Nile to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs short ball on middle and off, Mushi rocks back and pulls wide of the long leg fielder. Terrific strike"
64,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 run very eager to use his feet against the spinner. Reaches the pitch and drills it down to long-on"
65,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, 1 run flights it and uses a slower pace, Mushi waits and nudges through square leg"
66,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 run beaten in flight but because he went through with the shot, he was able to cart this tossed up delivery outside off to long-on"
67,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, SIX runs this sails into the Mirpur crowd! That's how you use you feet, got under the flighted ball and smacks it for an 84m-six over deep midwicket"
68,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, 1 run flighted on and around leg stump, much slower in pace and Mushi nudges it off his pads"
69,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 run short and wide, Shakib backs away and slaps it to the sweeper"
70,"Bollinger to Shakib, 2 runs chips it over mid-off, who despite making good ground by running back, is not able to get under it. Fuller delivery on off stump hoisted over the infield"
71,"Bollinger to Shakib, 1 run short ball and he's been very willing to take them head on. Once again he's quick on the pull and finds the man at deep square leg"
72,"Bollinger to Mushfiqur, 1 run 141kph, back of a length delivery on leg stump, flicked behind square leg"
73,"Bollinger to Shakib, 1 run fullish on leg stump, pushed down the ground to long-on"
74,"Bollinger to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs this has been murdered! Australia's plan of bowling short is backfiring big time! Doesn't matter if he was on the front foot, this sat up and he's pummeled it in front of midwicket"
75,"Bollinger to Mushfiqur, no run thinks it would be the fuller one and races down the track, but Bollinger double bluffs. Shorter ball directed across him and it bounces much more to beat his slashing blade"
76,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run slower ball, drags it short and wide outside off. So wide that the batsman's timing is shot as he cuts to deep point"
77,"Christian to Mushfiqur, 1 run back of a length on off stump, nudged away to mdiwicket who sends in a direct hit. The third umpire is called. He's well in"
78,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run short ball, he's been quick to pull but has mistimed it. Goes uppishly in the region of mid-on, if it had been there"
79,"Christian to Mushfiqur, no run slower short ball on off stump, dabbed to midwicket with soft hands"
80,"Christian to Mushfiqur, 2 runs length ball, he picks it up and lashes it wide of long-on. Looked like he had smoked it, but he's got too much height on it"
81,"Christian to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs lovely ball, doesn't deserve the eventual result. The offcutter was dug in short as he saw the batsman charging at him. Mushi looks to ramp it over third man, but is beaten. The ball bounces before Haddin and spins past him"
82,"Maxwell to Shakib, 1 bye flighted outside off, and Shakib lashes out with a cover drive. Haddin didn't stay low enough and lets a bye through"
83,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, no run flighted outside off, he blocks solidly"
84,"Maxwell to Mushfiqur, 1 run gets down on one knee and slog sweeps this flighted ball on middle and leg to deep square leg"

88,"Maxwell to Shakib, SIX runs thumped straight down the ground! Shakib is motoring along. Gets under this quick dart on middle and heaves it towards the sight screen"
89,"Christian to Mushfiqur, 1 run short on off stump, he backs away and cuts to deep point"
90,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run length ball outside off, Shakib slog sweeps to deep midwicket"
91,"Christian to Mushfiqur, no run keeps making room as he charges him and the endeavor throws him off balance and too far away from the short ball outside off to make contact"
92,"Christian to Mushfiqur, 1 run stays put and pulls this short ball on middle to deep square leg"
93,"Christian to Shakib, 1 run offers it up on length and outside off, but Shakib's slog goes more off the inside half of the bat. Single to deep midwicket to bring up the 100 partnership"
94,"Christian to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs full and wide outside off, Mushi has flayed this through point. Third man is too fine to cut this off. Clean strike"
95,"Starc to Shakib, 1 run terrific yorker as he followed Shakib, who was backing away outside leg. That's when he's dangerous, when he gets those those big inswinging yorkers"
96,"Starc to Mushfiqur, 1 wide this time the yorker goes wrong. Ends up a wide full toss outside off, nowhere near Mushi's reach"
97,"Starc to Mushfiqur, 1 run another full toss and this sits up for Mushi to pound over the covers. Should really have beaten that man in the deep"
98,"Starc to Shakib, 1 run walks across as he bets on Starc going full and straight. Scoops it to long leg, excellent sense of timing from Shakib. Had he missed that he would have been bowled"
99,"Starc to Mushfiqur, 2 runs searing yorker on off stump, Mushi jams down an open face down on it and gets a couple to third man"
100,"Starc to Mushfiqur, 1 run slower short ball and Mushi was into the pull a little too early, but he had adjusted well enough to have it drop short of the man at long leg"
101,"Starc to Shakib, no run 145kph, lovely finish. Yorker on middle stump, kept out quite nicely too"
102,"Watson to Mushfiqur, 1 wide starts off with a full one way down leg. Mushi was looking to lap it away to the fine leg boundary, but can't put bat to ball. Easy wide though"
103,"Watson to Mushfiqur, no run walks at him, but Watson sends down a fuller ball that sneaks between bat and pad. Almost yorked himself as he goes for a flick"
104,"Watson to Mushfiqur, OUT went deep in his crease to try and get under this fuller ball on middle, but the slog falls safely into the hands of Maxwell at deep midwicket. Falls short of a well-deserved fifty"
105,"Watson to Shakib, 1 wide fuller delivery pushed way too far across the left-hander, even if he was moving across to off stump"
106,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run slashed to deep point as this was full and wide outside off again"
107,"Watson to Mahmudullah, 1 run full delivery on off stump, pushed to long-on"
108,"Watson to Shakib, no run 135kph, excellent bouncer! Loads of effort in this as he gets the ball to rise above Shakib's shoulder and defeat his frenetic pull"
109,"Watson to Shakib, 1 wide goes for the wrong option this time. Tries to sneak a wide yorker inside the guideline, but doesn't succeed"
110,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run full and just outside off, Shakib lashes and the resulting thick outside edge goes on a spree to third man"
111,"Bollinger to Shakib, no run walks across to lap it fine, but Bollinger's yorker smacks onto his boot. Struck just a shade outside the line, reckons the umpire as he turns down the bowler's appeal"
112,"Bollinger to Shakib, FOUR runs length ball outside off, Shakin reaches out and belts it over the top of mid-off. Terrible bowling for his field"
113,"Bollinger to Shakib, OUT he has struck this quite hard, but Maxwell has pulled off a blinder at deep midwicket. Cleared his legs for a full swing of the bat down on this full ball on middle. It went flat and hard and Maxi runs forward and dives full length to cling on to a low chance"
114,"Bollinger to Mahmudullah, no run back of a length and pushed across him, he taps with an open face towards point"
115,"Bollinger to Mahmudullah, 1 run 141kph, short ball on off stump, Mahmudullah keeps to his crease and pulls down to long leg"
116,"Bollinger to Nasir, 1 run slower ball, pitched short and outside off. Cut away to deep third man"
117,"Watson to Nasir, FOUR runs this is in the slot, made so by Nasir rushing down the track. Gets under it and lifts it over extra cover. No need to slog whatsoever"
118,"Watson to Nasir, 1 run low full toss, following the batsman who was making room outside leg. Clipped away smartly to deep square leg"
119,"Watson to Mahmudullah, 1 run very full on middle and leg, Mahmudullah gets a thick inside edge to long leg"
120,"Watson to Nasir, (no ball) 138kph, sends down a rather high full toss way wide of the off stump. The batsman advancing has shorted Watson's radar"

122,"Watson to Nasir, 1 run flicked away to deep midwicket as he bowls full and on leg stump"
123,"Watson to Mahmudullah, 1 run ensures the batsman get get too far under the ball as he keeps it full on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"
124,"Starc to Mahmudullah, 1 run fires it full and just wide of off stump, jammed away to point"

126,"Starc to Mahmudullah, 1 run jams in a yorker on middle, dug out down the ground"
127,"Starc to Nasir, FOUR runs low full toss outside off, slammed through cover. Bisects the man inside the circle and Maxwell in the deep. Offered room and taken advantage of"
128,"Starc to Nasir, 2 runs slower short ball, again with room on offer. Flat bats it down the ground and they snare a rapid could against David Warner's arm. That's well done!"
129,"Starc to Nasir, OUT bowled off the last ball as he was trying to make room! Beaten for pace as he tried to dab it away to third man for at best a single"
130,"5.05pm Australia started quite well, but Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim wrenched the game from the visitors' grasp with an enterprising 100-plus partnership. Both batsmen were quite adept at besting Australia's short-ball plan and have placed Bangladesh in a very good position."
131,"Sohag Gazi to start things off, no surprise there. Aaron Finch and David Warner look all set"
132,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, no run good length ball, turning just a touch on middle. Defended off the back foot"

136,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, SIX runs this is biiiiiig! Goes down on one-knee and smacks this way into the crowd behind midwicket. One-handed catch in the crowd as this slog sweep epitomises Finch's power"

138,"Al-Amin to Finch, 1 run fullish on off stump, walks down the pitch and clips it away through midwicket"

140,"Al-Amin to Warner, FOUR runs short and wide and Warner slaps this through the hands of cover point. Stand and delivery stuff. Doesn't even bother running"
141,"Al-Amin to Warner, no run tighter line on off stump as the back of a length ball is defended down the pitch"
142,"Al-Amin to Warner, 1 run tucks him up on middle and leg, Warner nudges into the leg side and though Al-Amin chases after it and sends in a throw at the keeper's end, Finch was well home"
143,"Al-Amin to Finch, 1 leg bye shortish in length as he angles this in at him. Finch is on the back foot and whips behind square leg. Don't think there was bat involved though"
144,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, no run flatter ball on middle, Finch goes back and picks it away to midwicket"
145,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, 1 run prefers to wait on the back foot as he turns it away to short fine leg. Warner calls it through for a single"

154,"Shakib to Warner, no run"
155,"Shakib to Warner, 1 run skips down the track and swings with the turn, but this one doesn't. Gets a leading edge that gains far more height than Warner would like. Anamul was running back from mid-on and despite a flailing dive, he can't get a hand to it"
156,"Sohag Gazi to Warner, FOUR runs changes his grip, switches right-handed and sweeps him to third man. The bowler had pulled his length back, but that just allowed him to get under it"
157,"Sohag Gazi to Warner, no run flights it on middle and blocks nicely"
158,"Sohag Gazi to Warner, no run switch hit again, but this time he can't connect with a late cut. He wanted to switch hit it to third man, but when he saw the bowler pulling his length back he adjusted his shot, but misses"

162,"Shakib to Warner, 1 run lands this short on leg stump and Warner pulls it to deep square leg"
163,"Shakib to Finch, FOUR runs this was much slower, but his length isn't quite the best. Sat up for Finch who goes deep in his crease and bludgeons it through the covers"
164,"Shakib to Finch, FOUR runs slows it up again and this time he flights it, which fetches him a moral victory. Went on with the arm as well, and Finch gets an inside edge to the fine leg boundary"
165,"Shakib to Finch, no run flighted on middle, comes forward to block"
166,"Shakib to Finch, SIX runs hoisted over extra cover and he collects the most casual six. Made room for himself and gave it direction, was all he did"
167,"Shakib to Finch, 1 run drags his length back and he was waiting for it, dabs towards point for a single"
168,"Taskin to Finch, no run 135kph, shortish and just outside off, Finch doesn't have enough room to cut and is beaten"
169,"Taskin to Finch, 1 run short again, this time on middle, and Finch pulls to deep midwicket"
170,"Taskin to Warner, no run short of a good length, but on leg stump. Warner would be disappointed at not connecting the half-sweep well enough to beat short fine leg"
171,"Taskin to Warner, 1 leg bye slower ball, goes down the leg side. Finch wants to pinch a single. Might be tight with a direct hit, third umpire is called in to adjudicate. He's quite safe"

173,"Taskin to Warner, 1 leg bye 140kph, fuller delivery angled at the pads, and that is where it deflects off. Single to short fine leg"

177,"Razzak to Warner, no run big shot as the batsman shoulders arms, but this was sliding down leg. Warner thought this would have been a wide"
178,"Razzak to Warner, no run flighted outside leg, and he sweeps to short fine leg"
179,"Razzak to Warner, 2 runs keeps the dart to outside off stump and Warner chops to point. An unnecessary throw results in an extra run"
180,"Taskin to Finch, no run extracts a bit more bounce off this deck. Nips back in and beats Finch's cut shot. Big appeal from both the captain and the bowler, but the umpire is unmoved"
181,"Taskin to Finch, no run a shorter ball outside off, Finch misses out on the cut again. This time it had enough room to be clattered to the boundary. Should consider himself lucky"
182,"Taskin to Finch, 1 run 137kph, goes fuller and Finch is stuck in his crease. Blocks and gets it off the bottom of the bat. Warner wants a quick single. Taskin runs forward to field it himself but sends a wild through to long-on"

184,"Taskin to Finch, 1 run full and outside off, Finch drills it to mid-off who is on the edge of the circle"

186,"Shakib to Finch, 1 run flights it up on middle, Finch waits on it on the front foot and pushes into the covers. Easy single with the man on the edge of the circle"
187,"Shakib to Warner, SIX runs slog sweep again and it's the same result. Pounded over midwicket as manages to get under it and a clean swing of the arms powers it away"
188,"Shakib to Warner, SIX runs back-to-back! Shakib's figures get dented further as Warner charges him and swings it over midwicket"
189,"Shakib to Warner, no run darted in on off stump, whipped to midiwcket"

192,"Sohag Gazi to Warner, 1 run flighted on leg stump, but Warner prefers to stay back and clip it to deep square leg"
193,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, SIX runs a bit too much air on this one, also too much room. Finch gets down on one-knee and cart him over midwicket."
194,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, no run darts one in on middle and leg, Finch goes back and blocks"
195,"Sohag Gazi to Finch, no run Mushi's certain that was out, he's bewildered at the umpire's decision to rule this not out. And yep, there was a giant edge. This was flatter on off stump and he went back to cut. This almost goes off the face and was well taken by the keeper. Umpire Dharmasena was staunchly shaking"

199,"Al-Amin to Warner, OUT off goes the middle stump and Al-Amin sends Warner off, with a few verbals as well. Good length ball angled in at the stumps as he had switched around the wicket. The batsman went for a pull, when it wasn't really short enough and misses. Middle stump is knocked back and Al-Amin gets in W"

203,"Al-Amin to White, 2 runs this was chipped in the air, but falls right between midwicket and mid-on. The ball seemed to hold up on the pitch a little more and White was way too early into the flick"
204,"Al-Amin to White, no run fullish on off, White is forward and blocks towards midwicket"
205,"Taskin to Finch, FOUR runs low full toss outside off, Finch drills this through the covers to raise his second fifty of the tournament. This seems to be a match-winning one"

208,"Taskin to Finch, 1 run 143kph, fuller ball outside off, pushed down to long-off"

217,"Razzak to Finch, no run stays back despite a bit of flight on this, pushed into the covers"
218,"Mominul to White, 1 run stays quite low! Darted in on middle and leg and White just manages to whip it behind square leg"
219,"Mominul to Finch, FOUR runs short ball, slammed to the cover boundary. Made room outside leg and he's muscled this away. No need to keep it down"

221,"Mominul to White, 1 run came forward and pushes this towards point"

223,"Mominul to Finch, 1 run dart outside off stump, cut away to deep point"
224,"Al-Amin to Finch, OUT terrific catch from Nasir, who inspects his right wrist to check for damage. Leg cutter dupes him as Finch backs away and looks to flay this over the covers.

231,"Taskin to Maxwell, OUT misses a full toss and has his stumps in disarray. First T20 wicket for Taskin. Looked to hit across the line towards midwicket and the bat face closed a little too early. Consolation wicket, but Australia are already on the cusp of a... uh, consolation victory"
