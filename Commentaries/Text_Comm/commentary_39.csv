30,"Wood to Stoinis, OUT edged and taken! Bowls full, tempting Stoinis to drive, but the ball takes the outside edge and Buttler needs to dive to his right to take the catch. That was quick! A good innings from Stoinis in a position he usually doesn't bat in, but with the start he got, he will feel disappointed not capitalizing"

43,"Rashid to Labuschagne, 1 run good length, on middle. Paddled behind square"

Marnus reviews right away No bat involved, and that's pitched just outside off, and hit off stump. Labuschagne needs to go. Rashid gets the wicket via the googly. Australia in all sorts of trouble"

83,"Archer to Maxwell, no run back of a length, just outside off, and he rides the bounce to tap it towards point"
84,"Archer to Maxwell, 5 runs full, on off, and the attempted straight drive is mistimed to mid on instead. The fielder at mid on has a shy at the stumps, but its an awry throw. Buttler's nowhere near, the fielder backing up has no chance either, and that's run away for some more free runs. Moeen Ali the guilty fielder. Reckon those runs should be added to his bowling tally"
85,"Archer to Marsh, no run back of a length, on off, and punched right back to the bowler"
86,"Archer to Marsh, no run"
87,"Archer to Marsh, 1 run slower ball that does not come out right. Ends up as a dipping full toss, and driven to cover. Decent ball to be fair because Marsh was quite surprised"

220,"Wood to Marsh, OUT struck on the pad, and the finger goes up! Marsh reviews immediately. Looked pretty good to the naked eye, and Ultra-Edge says there's no bat involved. Hit in-line, and hitting middle-and-leg three-quarters of the way up! Marsh has to depart after a gritty 73. He was looking to get off strike with a push into the leg side towards midwicket, but Wood did him for pace."
221,"Archer to Starc, FOUR runs slot ball, Starc plays a beautiful on-drive to clear mid-on inside the ring! Textbook stuff, high front elbow, and a poor start to Archer's final over"

229,"Wood to Starc, no run slower ball, Starc backs away looks to slash over the infield on the off side but can't lay a bat on it, and Buttler makes an excellent one-handed diving stop"
230,"Wood to Starc, 1 run banged in on a length, Starc punches out to Morgan at short extra cover and sneaks through for a single"
231,"Wood to Zampa, 1 leg bye length ball, nudged towards the covers as Zampa backs away. They take on a sharp single, Wood kicks towards the stumps at the keeper's end but Starc is comfortably in even as the ball hits the stumps"

238,"Woakes to Starc, SIX runs length ball, pace off again, but Starc picks it this time and nails it over midwicket for a towering six! Free swing of the arms, and it lands on the hover-cover 10 yards over the boundary. That's only the third boundary Australia have managed since Maxwell was out in the 44th over"
239,"4.45pm: An odd innings, held together by Mitchell Marsh's 73 with Marcus Stoinis (43) and Glenn Maxwell (77) both putting some pressure on England's bowlers. Australia were in all sorts at 123 for 5, with Mark Wood and Adil Rashid taking two early wickets each, but managed to recover well thanks to a 126-run stand between Maxwell and Marsh. England did pretty well after Archer got Maxwell, banging the"
240,"5.12pm Hello and welcome back to the chase. If this was any other side, on a tired batting track, we'd say the chasing team's backs are against the wall, but not when England are the team trying to raze this total down. But the way Mitch Starc ended the Australia innings, if he could bring that momentum into his opening spell and take a wicket or two... then it's game on.Bairstow's doing his final str"

249,"Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run good length, on off, and defended off the back foot, with the bat's open face. Bairstow wants the run, but third slip runs across to end that thought"

261,"Hazlewood to Roy, no run good length, outside off, kinda close to his body for the cut, but goes for it anyway. Misses, and shall be glad that didn't take a tickle to the keeper"
262,"Hazlewood to Roy, no run back of a length, outside off, and he opens the bat's face to punch a bit squarer. Finds cover point though"

265,"Hazlewood to Roy, OUT what a stunner! A one-handed grab... on his followthrough, that's epic from Hazlewood! Not full enough for the drive, yet he drives, but the ball comes off the actual middle of the bat - which isn't really the sweet spot - and Hazlewood maintains his balance to stick his right hand out and the ball stays in his palm. Big wicket t"

413,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run opens the face, steering past the diving Maxwell at backward point"

415,"Stoinis to Bairstow, (no ball) very short bouncer to start, which loops harmlessly over Bairstow's head and is called wide. And the third umpire reckons he overstepped too, so there's a free hit coming up"
416,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs Bairstow clears the front leg and heaves this high and mighty into the leg side... but there's more elevation than distance, and Labuschagne settles under it. He drops it - not that it would have counted - and England sneak back for two"

425,"Cummins to Billings, FOUR runs slightly back of a length, and Billings pulls awkwardly, bottom-edging in front of square.

426,"Cummins to Billings, 1 run flicked off the hip down towards fine leg for one"
