575,This is Marc Ellison on behalf of the crew here at Cricinfo saying thanks again and we will see you soon. Bye for now.
576,"Thanks for joining us today. Join us again on Thursday at 1400 local time, that is 0100 GMT for the 4th ODI from Auckland."
577,"Brad Haddin deservedly takes the Man of the Match award for his magnificent 110. Haddin is glad to push on to three figures after getting a few starts in the series, especially with his skipper putting the pressure on the top order for someone to make a ton."
578,"Ricky Ponting is obviously chuffed with the team for their efforts and admits that bowling first was the right choice in the end and that, possibly, that could be the way to go in the future. He says his batsmen need to continue to make big scores and is happy they take the momentum to Auckland."
579,Daniel Vettori blames the top order for a poor showing as the reason why they weren't able to post a competitive total. He says the wicket was more like a 300 run track and not the 250 they scored. He says injuries are an issue and he is hopeful that they have 15 fit players for Thursday.
580,"New Zealand simply did not score enough runs and the Batting Power Play worked to their detriment as they lost five for 32 to be bowled out for 246 when, with Styris and Hopkins at the crease, they looked like posting close to 300 which would've been a far more competitive total."
581,Haddin (110) and Ponting (69) added 151 for the second wicket and the match was over pretty early in that sense with both players looking in total control at the crease.
582,Australia win by the comfortable margin of six wickets with 16 balls to spare. Australia outplayed New Zealand in all departments today and will take a lot of momentum into the 4th ODI in Auckland on Thursday.
583,Australia won by 6 wickets (with 16 balls remaining)
584,"Player of the match is Brad Haddin, AUS"
