0,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run forays down the track, but Bhuvi offers no room to exploit as Hughes pushes it down the ground to mid-on"
1,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, 1 run this time he is on the pads and Highes only has to work it off to fine leg and jog a single"
2,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run tiniest bit of away movement as Finch goes back and blocks the fullish ball"
3,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shortish and outside off, been a staple length today and Finch pulls out his favourite shot of the morning, punchint it to extra"
4,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run and the only change up to that plan is when the bowler goes on the pads, and is easily picked away to deep fine leg"
5,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, FOUR runs a swift spare of runs in the last couple of overs. Ishant bowls this way outside the line of leg stump and Hughes did well to reach it and even better to flick it well to the left of the man at deep fine leg"
6,"Vinay to Finch, no run oops, that kept low! It was nowhere near full of length and Finch was justified in going back, but the ball is only around shin high and he just manages to get his bat in line"
7,"Vinay to Finch, 1 run this time he is ready for the ball, in case it keeps low, and pushes it down the ground confidently"
8,"Vinay to Hughes, 1 run oh, that surprised him. He was coming down the track and Vinay digs this one into the middle of the pitch. Hughes is caught off guard as he hooks and the ball goes in the air to vacant square leg region. Good bowling there"
9,"Vinay to Finch, no run explores a fuller length and he's driven quite strongly down the ground off the front foot"
10,"Vinay to Finch, FOUR runs tries another short ball, but Finch is far more equipped to handle this one. He is still at the crease, pushes his weight ball and hooks the ball quite well to beat the man at deep square leg"
11,"Vinay to Finch, no run this one seams back in from outside off and Finch, looking to cut, had to adjust at the last minute and chop it to point"
12,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run"
13,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, 1 run nudged off his pads to deep square leg as the fuller length ball is picked off to deep square leg"
14,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run just a tad bit slower, 124kph, and fuller as Finch flows into a front foot cover drive. But the fielder is on hand to stop it"
15,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run opens the face on impact to steer this shortish ball on off stump to point"
16,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shortish ball, but FInch was coming on to the front foot and slaps it down the ground but the bowler moves across in his follow through and fields it to prevent any runs"
17,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run fuller and on the off stump corridor as Finch presses forward and pushes it down to long-off"
18,"Vinay to Finch, no run good lines here from Vinay. Full length ball on off stump which forces the batsman to meet it with a defensive bat on the front foot"
19,"Vinay to Finch, FOUR runs oh, he finds the gap through the off side. The ball was on a similar length as the last one, but there was possibly just a hint more room. Finch stays leg side of it and meets it with a full-flowing drive that beats the diving man at short extra cover."
20,"Vinay to Finch, no run oh, he almost dragged that onto his stumps. It didnt have enough room for the pull shot, though it was short enough. The ball takes the bottom edge and skirts just wide of the off stump"
21,"Vinay to Finch, 2 runs this one pitched on middle and wasn't too short, but at Vinay's pace, it is still easy enough to rick back and pull strongly in front of square."
22,"Vinay to Finch, no run takes the outside half of the bat as he goes back to defend the short of a length ball on off stump"
23,"Vinay to Finch, no run steers the back of a length ball to point off a strong back foot push"
24,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run fuller length around the off stump corridor, to which Hughes stays in the crease and drives it to mid-off"
25,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run fuller again this time he places it a little wide of the man at mid-off, but he comes up quickly to force both batsmen to rush back into their crease and abandon thoughts of a single"
26,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, 1 run strays on the pads this time, though on a fuller length, and is clipped through square leg"
27,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run fuller and homing in on middle and leg, driven down the ground to long-on"
28,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run on a good length and its pushed down the ground to mid-off"
29,"Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, no run shorter than usual from Bhuvi and a little bit of room too. Hughes was looking for that, but his rasping cut shot only goes as far as point"
30,"Vinay to Finch, SIX runs reaches his fifty with a six over deep square leg. The ball was dug in quite short, but Finch made no effort to keep it down even if there was a man patrolling the boundary. Confident strike."
31,"Vinay to Finch, OUT Raina does the trick with the bowlers hardly looking likely to get the wicket. Finch dabbed it to the covers off the back foot and set off for a quick single, but even as he stretched out to make his ground, the throw had already broken the stumps"
32,"Vinay to Hughes, 1 run this time the direct hit leaks runs. Hughes tucks the ball off his hips and the square leg did well to get to the ball, but Watson was well back in his crease leaving very little need for the throw"
33,"Vinay to Watson, FOUR runs And he gets off the mark with a four. Streaky though it was. The ball was outside off and its length ensured the cut shot was on, but the ball leaps up above where the slips would have been and goes to the fence"
34,"Vinay to Watson, no run fullish and on middle which is blocked solidly back to the bowler"
35,"Vinay to Watson, no run opens the face of the bat as he steers the back of a length ball outside off stump to point"

37,"Jadeja to Hughes, 1 run plods his front foot right across to the off stump and sweeps the fullish ball to deep fine leg"
38,"Jadeja to Watson, no run angled on leg stump and turns just a little, which Watson is wary of as he defends straight down the line of it"
39,"Jadeja to Watson, no run more turn for Jadeja, who flights this a little bit more and draws Watson forward. The ball beats the edge and Dhoni asks for a stumping, but there is nothing there"
40,"Jadeja to Watson, 1 run gets right to the pitch of this one with his reach and drives it to long-on"
41,"Jadeja to Hughes, 1 run shuffles across to the off side again and works the ball around the deep square leg"
42,"Vinay to Hughes, no run length delivery on off, the batsman pushes it to midwicket"
43,"Vinay to Hughes, no run fuller length on off, it invited the drive and Hughes crunches it off the front foot, but straight to cover"
44,"Vinay to Hughes, 1 run ah, another shortish delivery on the pads and Hughes wanted to whack it to the deep square leg boundary, but doesn't get hold of it completely, ends up playing it to fine leg"

54,"Ashwin to Hughes, no run pushed through on off stump, the batsman defends it to point"
55,"Ashwin to Hughes, 1 run slower and a lot of turn on this one, Hughes waits and tries to cut it, but ends up scooping it towards point, not in control at all, it just drops short of the fielder"
56,"Ashwin to Watson, no run fuller delivery on off stump, Watson plays it with turn towards midwicket"
57,"Ashwin to Watson, SIX runs now he bowls a long hop, you can't expect to give away anything less than six on those ones. Watson smashes it flat, over the deep midwicket fielder"

59,"Ashwin to Watson, no run flatter this time, the batsman defends it to midwicket"

70,"Ashwin to Watson, FOUR runs there was a fielder at deep midwicket, but he could just see this fly 5 feet away from him. It was short and it was slapped hard to the boundary. Lots of short and filthy deliveries from Ashwin"
71,"Ashwin to Watson, no run now bowls a conventional delivery outside off, the batsman defends"

87,"Jadeja to Watson, no run fuller and straighter this time, Watson defends it down the pitch"

132,"Vinay to Watson, OUT he has disappeared trying to up the rate! It was a short of length delivery outside off and Watson tries to power it over long on with a flat-bat hammer hit, but ends up hitting it high rather than long, it descends at long on where Ishant takes a well-judged catch"

177,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run gets forward and nudges the full length ball straight of midwicket to pick up an easy single"

186,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run goes back and cuts the length ball to deep point"
187,"Vinay to Maxwell, 2 runs lazy work from India there. Maxwell flicks the shortish ball off his pads to deep square leg but a bad throw from the deep and Dhoni was lax as well, trying to collect it with one hand and the deflection off his glove allows the batsmen to steal a second"
188,"Vinay to Maxwell, 1 run in compensation, he doesn't even pitch the ball this time as Maxwell drills this through midwicket"
189,"Vinay to Bailey, 1 run chops the length ball outside off to third man to rotate strike"

191,"Vinay to Maxwell, FOUR runs slopping from Ashwin, he's leaking runs in the field to add to his woeful time with the ball. Vinay's in dipper snuck low off the pitch and Maxwell was almost beaten, but his flick somehow managed to get enough bat to head straight to fine leg, where Ashwin doesn't get down low enough"
192,"Vinay to Maxwell, FOUR runs dropped Length ball, angling on the pads meets a crisp pick-up shot from Maxwell. Bhuvi was coming in off the boundary and suddenle realises he has to go back and the ball bounces off his palms and into the boundary"
193,"Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run fuller ball to which the batsman comes forward and drives to long-on"
194,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run little room on offer and Maxwell makes some of his own to cut it to deep point"
195,"Jadeja to Bailey, SIX runs on middle stump and Bailey employs the slog sweep to excellent effect. The ball is lifted over midwicket boundary. 87m six as Australia are motoring along"
196,"Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run better there as he flights the ball and Bailey comes forward and pushes through the covers"
197,"Jadeja to Maxwell, FOUR runs And Maxwell gets into the act. Length ball on off stump is dragged onto the leg side with a powerful short-armed pull shot"
198,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up and the batsman reaches forward and pushes into the off side"
199,"Vinay to Maxwell, FOUR runs turns that into a full toss with a little skip down the wicket and all he does is pierces the off side ring to collect another boundary"
200,"Vinay to Maxwell, 4 leg byes he shuffles across to the off side, wanting to turn the ball behind square on the leg side, but doesn't connect. Australia don't complain though as the ball runs away for four, even as the Indians appeal for lbw"
201,"Vinay to Maxwell, 1 run the length ball outside off is dabbed to third man, as it has been easily done all innings"
202,"Vinay to Bailey, 1 run mows the fullish ball on leg stump through midwicket, it was an ugly slog and he wears a wry smile as he jogs through for a single"
203,"Vinay to Maxwell, FOUR runs Jumps down the track, makes ample room for himself and smashes the leg cutter over the infield on the off side. And with all the men in the deep on the other side of the ground, there was no question where that ball was headed"
204,"Vinay to Maxwell, 1 run tries the yorker, but misses it by a few inches. Maxwell jams the ball onto his pad, looking to hoick it away, but they sneak a quick single"
205,"Sharma to Maxwell, FOUR runs goes for the yorker on off stump, but Maxwell has immense balance at the crease and drills the ball to the right of the man at extra cover"
206,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run this time he has a lot more room to work with and he's not happy after the ball was flayed only as far as deep point"
207,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run full toss on leg stump and he's very luck to get away with that. The man at fine leg is safe this time and there was even a possible chance of a run out, but Maxwell was too quick"
208,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide the leg stump line continues and even with Maxwell going for a wild slog over the top of short fine leg, the ball was too wide to connect"
209,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide and again. Maxwell was on his knees this time, hoping to exploit the vacant area at deep fine leg, but he would need a ten foot pole to have reached that"
210,"Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run yorker outside the off stump and Maxwell uses the open face to steer it to deep point"
211,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs yorker gone wrong again. Thigh-high full toss on off stump is heaved away wide of long-on. Australia are rampaging with these two at the crease"
212,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs more lacklustre death bowling from India. After following a wide with a wide, he follows a full toss with a full toss. He slams it over midwicket this time for the same result. And its fifty for Bailey"
213,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 2 runs and starts off with a useful yorker, but it is hardly threatening as Maxwell pushes it down the ground and exploits the slowness of the fielder at long on to rush back and reach his fifty off only 30 balls."
214,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 run fuller length again and homing on middle and leg, but Maxwell whips it away through midwicket for a single"
215,"Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 1 run slog off the back foot to the length ball on off stump. Long on moves to his right to tidy up"
216,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 run Bhuvi attacks a line outside off stump for his best attempt at a yorker, but the batsman pushes it down the ground for a single"
217,"Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 1 run, OUT and the low full toss materialises in his search for a yorker. But oh dear, both batsmen are at the bowler's end. Bailey had drilled it to long-off where Raina was lurking. Maxwell saw him, waited a bit and then ecided he would steal a second off him on the throw and raced down the pitch,"
218,"Bhuvneshwar to Voges, 1 run length ball on middle is worked away through midwicket for a single"
219,"Ashwin to Voges, 1 run and he uses the straighter one, which is dabbed into the off side"
220,"Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run charges the offspinner darted at off stump and drives it strongly down the ground to long-off"
221,"Ashwin to Voges, 1 leg bye Voges the new batsman employs the reverse sweep, but the ball goes off his thigh pad down to fine leg instead"
222,"Ashwin to Bailey, SIX runs pause and deliver only allowes Bailey that much more time to line it up and smash it over cow corner. It was the length ball on middle stump which is never any trouble in the death"
223,"Ashwin to Bailey, no run ducks in low as he pushes it through outside off stump. Bailey was trying to cut but he can't get low enough connect"
224,"Ashwin to Bailey, FOUR runs tossed it up well wide outside off, but Bailey sees it, comes down the track and nails it through the gap between cover and mid-off"
225,"Bhuvneshwar to Voges, 1 run fuller on middle, but the batsman still goes back, opens his front leg and slogs it through wide mid on"
226,"Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, FOUR runs full toss outside off and Bailey has a giant stride forward and slams it over the head of cover and with no one back behind him, it goes off for a four"
227,"Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 2 runs and Voges turns one into two to get the big-hitting Bailey back on strike. It was a length ball on middle and he carves it through to deep midwicket. But Voges had put his head down and raced up and down the pitch well before the throw came in"
228,"Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 1 run on a length again and Bailey doesnt connect as well as he had done over the course of this innings, so the ball lands short of the man at long-on"
229,"Bhuvneshwar to Voges, SIX runs oh, that was pure wristwork from Voges. It was the full toss on middle stump and he steps forward and just shovels it over the square leg boundary. That looked effortless"
230,"Bhuvneshwar to Voges, 1 run shortish, just a bit outside off and Voges guides it down to third man"
231,"Vinay to Voges, 1 run full on leg stump is driven down the ground to wide long-on for a single off the front foot"
232,"Vinay to Bailey, no run slower bouncer on middle and leg and Bailey is completely beaten as he goes for the pull shot far too early"
233,"Vinay to Bailey, 2 runs he gets the yorker more right than wrong that time, and Bailey digs it out well enough to reach the man at deep midwicket. Voges, with fresh legs, pulls Bailey through for the second yet another time"
234,"Vinay to Bailey, SIX runs length ball with just enough room outside off for Bailey to slam it for a 106 m six over cow corner"
235,"Vinay to Bailey, 1 run much better as he goes far more fuller this time and Bailey can only mishit it down the ground to collect a single"
236,"Vinay to Voges, OUT the reverse scoop proves fatal for Voges. It was full and outside off, which meant he had to change his shot from the orthodox scoop and he doesnt get enough bat on it to beat Bhuvi at short third man"
237,"Sharma to Bailey, 2 runs digs it into the middle of the pitch which gets the ball around head high outside off stump. Bailey tennis-forehands it down the ground to long-on and collects a couple"
238,"Sharma to Bailey, no run runs across to the off side to lift it over the keeper's head for a four, but the slower, full length ball beats him and goes tamely to the keeper"
239,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs and he bowls a length ball, which enables Bailey to get underneath it and slam the ball wide of the man at deep midwicket."
240,"Sharma to Bailey, 1 run gets it in the block hole on middle and Bailey digs it out as the ball goes down to long-on"
241,"Sharma to Haddin, 1 run he pulls the short of a length outside off to deep midwicket to give the strike back to Bailey for the last ball"
242,"Sharma to Bailey, FOUR runs carves it over point to finish the innings with a four to record the highest total in Jaipur. He went for a wide yorker, but Bailey got under it well enough to slam it almost for a six. Replays show the ball bounced just a few inches inside the rope"
243,5.00pm Brad Haddin had said Australia were looking to limit quick wickets in the middle and put on a better batting performance in Jaipur after putting up 304 on the board. Safe to say mistakes rectified. Australia's openers laid a solid foundation and their middle order contributed quite heavily to record the first time in ODIs
244,"5.30 pm It's been some pasting for the bowlers and now the batsmen have to come and do the mop-up job. One thing is for sure, Australia's bowlers are not likely to serve as many hit-me deliveries as the Indians. We are still ten or so minutes away from the start though."
245,"The teams are in the middle, let's get cracking ..Mitchell Johnson to start, Rohit Sharma on strike. Two slips in place"
246,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 4 leg byes that was quick, but it was also on the pads, flicks the thigh pads and hits the fine-leg boundary in no time.. 144 kph"

266,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, no run he keeps it on a length and on off stump, the batsman has no room to play with, he defends it back to the bowler"

279,"McKay to S Dhawan, 2 runs he does the same again, this time though the ball was much straighter. Dhawan uses his wrists to push it through cover, but the fielder gets a hand to it and slows it down a touch. There is also a man at deep cover now"

330,"Doherty to S Dhawan, no run is that all over? After tossing up a couple of deliveries, Doherty fires it flat and wide outside off, Dhawan was already pushing way forward and he tries to slap the delivery through off, but is beaten.

390,"Johnson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs this one was short enough and Dhawan climbs into it. Doesnt bother keeping it down because he knows there is no one in the in-field to stop that shot, which goes all the way to the square leg boundary"
391,"Johnson to S Dhawan, no run a little bit of inward movement, which Dhawan negotiates with soft hands as he defends the ball. His search for a quick single is denied after Rohit saw Johnson making a beeline for the ball"
392,"Johnson to S Dhawan, no run slower short ball, but only just at 130 kph. Dhawan was too early into his pull shot as the ball ducks beneath his bat and goes through to Haddin"

395,"Watson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs oh, imperious. Dhawan has found rich results when skipping down the track and this time he simply flays one to the left of the man at cover and the ball slams into the advertising boards in a flash"
396,"Watson to S Dhawan, no run"
397,"Watson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs and when they explore the middle of the pitch, Dhawan, rocks his weight back and punishes it dead square for another boundary"
398,"Watson to S Dhawan, no run that one dips a little low, but Dhawan still manages to pull it quite strongly to midwicket with the litte room available outside off"
399,"Watson to S Dhawan, no run another crisp stroke, but the square drive to the length ball outside off finds point"
400,"Watson to S Dhawan, 1 run on the shorter side again and Dhawan is happy to dab it into the off side and retain strike"
401,"Johnson to S Dhawan, no run full and homing in on middle stump. Dhawan's straight drive doesnt come off quite so well as the bat turns in his hand to deprive him of any timing on it"
402,"Johnson to S Dhawan, no run pitches it right up on off stump and Dhawan doesnt make any attempt to cover the line as he drills it to cover off the front foot"
403,"Johnson to S Dhawan, 1 run and there's the Mitchell Johnson short ball, and Dhawan's flash outside the off stump goes on the bounce to third man"
404,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run shorter ball again and Rohit tries to steer it to third man for a single, but can"
405,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run this time he does as Johnson looks to rattle him with short stuff from around the wicket. It isn't working though as Rohit did not look rushed in any way as he guided the ball to third man"
406,"Johnson to S Dhawan, 1 run its the swivel-pull from Dhawan again as he rolls his wrists on this one to make sure it stays down the ground to deep square leg"
407,"Faulkner to S Dhawan, OUT he's nicked it. And Dhawan admonishes himself as he walks off, five short of a century. James Faulkner though is over the moon. It was a good length ball outside off and Dhawan went for his cover drive, but this time his edges is taken instead of the middle"
408,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run a handsome drive to start off with as he gets to the pitch of that full length ball outside off. There was ample timing there, but it wasn't placed quite so well. The fielder at cover fumbles allowing a single"
409,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run on a length around the off stump and Rohit covers the line to defend it"
410,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full and outside off, Rohit gets nicely forward and opens the face of the bat to steer it to sweeper cover"
411,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run uses the little room on offer and dabs the back of a length ball down to deep third man to collect another single"
412,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run presses on the front foot and drives it down the ground to mid-off"
413,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run and he is treated to a bouncer first up, but Kohli was waiting for that as he stays back and pulls it down into the ground through midwicket"
414,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run opens the face when he meets the good length ball outside off stump to collect another run through third man"
415,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run This one didn't have as much room, but Kohli allowed it to reach him as he let it ride off the open face through to third man"
416,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run he's almost on one knee as he meets the ball well wide of off stump. The ball goes fine of point and deep third man is a very busy fielder"
417,"Johnson to Kohli, no run good length ball, and quick too - 153kph - angling in on middle to which Kohli presents a straight bat"
418,"Johnson to Kohli, no run gets a strong stride forward and drills the square drive to point off a fuller delivery"
419,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run uses the angle from aroudn the wicket to tuck him up as Rohit chops the back of a length ball into the off side"
420,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run the fuller length allows Rohit to punch it down the ground off the front foot and get off strike. He's been doing that quite well this innings"
421,"Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs steps down the pitch and whips it between midwicket and mid-on. It was in the air, but it was timed and placed well enough to give India another four"
422,"Faulkner to Kohli, no run this time he holds the length back and Kohli responds to it but dabbing it off the back foot to point"
423,"Faulkner to Kohli, no run a little in dip from the bowler, but Kohli rides that well, staying back in his crease and opening the face"
424,"Faulkner to Kohli, SIX runs down the track again and this time he gets six for it. While Fualkner goes for a tumble, Kohli stands and admires the shot as the full length ball aimed outside off sails over the long-off fence"
425,"Doherty to Rohit Sharma, 1 run crouches on one knee to sweep the ball, full and angled into middle, to the man at fine leg"
426,"Doherty to Kohli, no run charges the spinner too, but he his drive though strong is hit straight back to the bowler"
427,"Doherty to Kohli, 1 run some magic from Maxwell on the extra cover fence. First there was some magic from Kohli's wrists as he slammed the ball over the cover. Maxwell runs around from long-off and extends his hand full stretch to push the ball back in play"
428,"Doherty to Rohit Sharma, 1 run swift and flat whicih Rohit negotiates with a punch down to long-on"
429,"Doherty to Kohli, SIX runs This time he goes over the deep fielder too. And much straighter. Doherty isn't flighting the ball too much, but Kohli reaches to the pitch as he forays down the track and lifts it powerfully over the top"
430,"Doherty to Kohli, 1 run gets his front foot across to the off side to work the fullish ball through square leg"
431,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run slower ball to start off a new spell as Kohli comes down the track and adjusts his stroke to dab it square on the off side"
432,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, no run another slower one - 106kph - and Rohit was far too early on the pull shot, as he gets an under edge and the ball bounces tamely at his feet"
433,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs he's down. He's slapped that miles over midwicket and has gone down immediately with cramp on his right hamstring. This was not slower, but McKay persisted with the shortish length. Rohit was waiting for it and as he was admiring the shot, he grimaces, clutches his right hammie and goes dow"
434,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, no run goo length on middle to which he comes forward and hopes to work it into the on side, but doesn't get enough wrist into the stroke as McKay runs around to collect it"
435,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, 1 run pushed down the ground to long-on as McKay sticks to a much better, fuller length"
436,"McKay to Kohli, SIX runs off cutter gets smashed. Kohli has been violent when he gets down the track. He stays leg side of the ball to get all the leverage he needs to punish it over the top of long-off"
437,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run cramps him up, but Rohit adjusts well, chopping the ball square on the off side with soft hands and rushing off to collect a single"
438,"Watson to Kohli, SIX runs dismissed it. It was dragged down short and Kohli stays solid at the crease and slams it well over the midwicket fence, which Watson watches stunned"
439,"Watson to Kohli, no run looks for a dab through third man as Watson bowls back of a length on middle. There seemed to be some sort of noise and the Australians appeal, but the umpire is unmoved. Haddin put on a delayed appeal though"
440,"Watson to Kohli, no run gets forward to meet the full length ball with a lovely, straight bat"
441,"Watson to Kohli, FOUR runs another foray down the track and another imperious four. Made a little room for himself as he came down and just flays this through the covers with a touch of disdain"
442,"Watson to Kohli, 1 run and following the boundary, he waits for the ball to come it him and uses the tiny bit of room on it to dab it to third man and retain strike"
443,"McKay to Kohli, 2 runs they are racing between the wickets, even Rohit who is showing no signs of cramp now and the little flick through midwicket off a good length ball gets two runs"
444,"McKay to Kohli, FOUR runs another magnificent strike over cover and you guessed it, he was down the track again. It was on a length outside off and Kohli has no trouble lofting it over the top of cover for a one bounce four"
445,"McKay to Kohli, 1 run and that seems the only way to tether him. McKay bowls fullish on middle to which Kohli pushes down the ground to collect a single"
446,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, no run explores the off stump corridor against Rohit though, with a good length ball which is dabbed to the man at point"
447,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, no run cuts it to cover as McKay holds it at a shortish length outside off stump"
448,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs six, off only one hand. He did everything wrong there, but still got the maximum result. He was early into the shot, he hadn't moved toward the ball, though he did move forward. But somehow the ball hit the middle of the bat and sailed over point"
449,"Doherty to Kohli, no run he charges him again, but having been cramped for foot just defended"
450,"Doherty to Kohli, 2 runs stays back to the flatter ball and whips it wide of the man at long-on to collect a single"
451,"Doherty to Kohli, 1 run fifty to Kohli off only 27 balls as he nudges the full ball on his pads through midwicket."
452,"Doherty to Rohit Sharma, 1 run fuller and angled across the batsman who presses forward and blocks it down the ground for an easy single"
453,"Doherty to Kohli, SIX runs If he gets down the track, Australia better watch out. Reaches the pitch effortlessly and powers it straight over the top to pepper the long-off boundary"
454,"Doherty to Kohli, no run shorter and pitched outside leg, but the ball turns across the right-hander, who waits for it on the back foot and pushes it back down the pitch"
455,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide back-of-the-hand slower ball goes awry as the batsman watches it cross him well past the wide line on the off side"

457,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run another full, slower ball, which the batsman drags from outside off stump through midwicket"
458,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run inside edge foils that lbw appeal, but the bowler had the upper hand there, after a very long time in this match. It seemed ti skid off the pitch, catching Rohit off guard who was looking to play a lazy defensive stroke off the back foot"
459,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs nothing unconvincing about that. Ample room outside off, short again and Rohit, stayed back in his crease and flayed it over the top of cover"
460,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run shortish and just a small bit of room which enables him to nudge to backward point and collect a single"
461,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run charges the bowler and whips the ball through midwicket to get a single and retain strike"
462,"Johnson to Kohli, no run angles it across the right-hander who is happy to let the good length ball go to the keeper"
463,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs this time he is on the pads and Kohli's wrists are too strong for that ball to go anywhere other than to the boundary. Whips it powerfully past short fine leg"
464,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs and another one, this time he shovels the ball through the gape between midwicket and the man at long-on. It was a length ball and duly punished"
465,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run slower ball from Johnson, which doesn't post too much problem as he tucks it in front of midwicket"
466,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run full and angled at the non-existant slips, and Rohit leans into a lazily elegant drive to cover"
467,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run tight in defense as well as Johnson keeps the ball full and on off stump"
468,"Faulkner to Kohli, no run he charges down the pitch, makes it a yorker, but jams it out to midwicket"
469,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run he keeps charging out, this time he takes the ball on half-volley and smashes it to long on, for a single"
470,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs fuller delivery wide outside off and Rohit creams it through extra cover. Where are the fielders! No extra cover, no one in the deep. That's 100 of this stand too"
471,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run keeps it full and wide outside off, Rohit slices it straight to point this time"
472,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs fuller again and it's wide too, Rohit slices this time and beats point and once he has done that, there is no one in the deep! Where are the fielders?"
473,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full and on the middle, Rohit moves to 99 with a soft push to mid-on"
474,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run bowls it short of length on the body, Rohit dabs it to the off side, but there are lot of fielders close by"
475,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, no run full and aimed on the base of offstump, Rohit digs it out towards point"

478,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run gets this one to come in sharply from round the wicket, and Rohit gets an inside edge on to his pads, the bowler thinks about asking for an lbw, but realises there was a loud noise"
479,"Johnson to Kohli, 5 wide aims for a yorker, it's officially the bad Mitch today, he sprays it wide down the leg side and Haddin could do nothing to stop that"
480,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run fuller length delivery on the stumps, now Kohli is saved by the inside edge, it hits his pads and rolls towards gully"
481,"Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run length delivery on the stumps, Rohit dabs it to the right of midwicket for a single"
482,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run back of length delivery on off, Rohit punches it to the off side, but as far as cover"
483,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of length delivery on the body, slightly slower that usual, the batsman punches it down to long off for a single"

486,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run his bat face gets closed as he ends up placing this down to long on, he was aiming for long off with this"
487,"Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs one bounce, second bounce and it's four again! It was fuller delivery on the middle stump line and Rohit chipped it in the air, but he opened the face slightly to place it over extra cover"
488,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs oh this one is brutally cracked through cover! It was hurled at 90 mph, it went through cover at double the speed, really really brutal cover drive"
