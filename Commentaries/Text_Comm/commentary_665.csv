592,Thank you for tuning into Cricinfo's live coverage of today's game. We'll be back on Tuesday when England take on New Zealand at Adelaide. That will be a crucial match for New Zealand who haven't picked up any points so far. Do join us then. Cheers!
593,How many times have we seen Hussey do a Bevan now? His superb innings seals Australia's spot in the final. Credit to New Zealand for fighting as hard as they did. McMillan set the match up with a belligerent 89 but New Zealand could have done with a few more runs. Australia's chase started poorly - they lost their first three wickets for 17 but Clarke and Hussey played gritty innings to seal Australia's
594,Australia won by 2 wickets (with 8 balls remaining)
595,"Player of the match is Michael Clarke, AUS"
