433,"Thakur to Agar, no run length ball on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
434,"Thakur to Agar, no run length ball close to off stump. Not wide or short enough to cut, and he ends up chopping it hard into the pitch"
435,"Thakur to Agar, 1 run fullish, angling across, pushed towards mid-off for the quick single"
436,"Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run length ball close to off stump, punched with an open face through point"
437,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run shortish, angling into off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
438,"Natarajan to Agar, 1 run length ball outside off, makes a bit of room to drive to deep cover"
439,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 3 runs fullish, angling into off stump from round the wicket. Opens his bat face and steers it a long way to the left of the cover sweeper. Excellent placement"
440,"Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs there's the Natarajan yorker. Homing in on Agar's front toe, and he looks to jam down on it and gets the tiniest of inside edges that sends the ball scooting past leg stump for four"
441,"Natarajan to Agar, 1 run length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
442,"Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, and Maxwell puts it away. Lets it come on and jabs it between backward point and short third man. A difficult field to bowl to against a set batsman"
443,"Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run shortish outside off, slapped to deep point"
444,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run very full, quicker ball in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed to short cover"
445,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run tossed up on middle stump. Doesn't get a stride in, ends up stuck in the crease. Flicked to midwicket"
446,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run full on off stump, driven to short cover"
447,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, Maxwell brings out the reverse-sweep but can't beat deep point"
448,"Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run back of a length fairly wide of off stump. Agar doesn't pick the wrong'un. He was shaping to slap it through point, maybe, and ends up playing a hurried flick to long-on"
449,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run on the pads, nudged into the square leg region"
450,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room"
451,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run low full-toss close to off stump. Punched back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat. Was probably aiming to go through cover"
452,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run full-toss, about thigh-high, on the stumps. Steps across and whips it to fine leg"
453,"Bumrah to Agar, no run slower ball, fullish on leg stump. Clipped to midwicket"
454,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run looks for the yorker, ends up bowling a low full-toss on off stump, clipped towards midwicket, who moves quickly to his right to stop it but lets the ball get away from him slightly"
455,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run slower bouncer over off stump, and Maxwell picked it late. Was looking to hook, initially, then he pulled out and semi-ducked to get himself under it"
456,"Kuldeep to Agar, 2 runs shortish outside off, slapped to deep point"
457,"Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up close to off stump, whipped down to long-on"
458,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs what. A. Shot. Maxwell hits more reverse-sweeps for six than pretty much everyone else, and this time he had to manufacture even more power given that Kuldeep dangled it up slow, and it also landed a little shorter than you"
459,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run fuller and flatter, whipped to long-on"
460,"Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on"
461,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
462,"Natarajan to Maxwell, SIX runs goes for the yorker, and Maxwell was expecting that, sitting quite deep in his crease on off stump. Simply brings those wrists into play and whips it over the midwicket boundary to bring up another superlative half-century"
463,"Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs low full-toss on off stump, and Maxwell's eased it for four, just a push between mid-off and extra-cover"
464,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run goes a bit wider with the yorker, and Maxwell collapses his back knee to get down low and steer it to deep backward point"
465,"Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs shortish outside off, and now Agar joins in the fun. Not bowling to his field, is Natarajan. Cuts it to the left of backward point, and the sweeper is well in front of square, so no way is he getting to that"
466,"Natarajan to Agar, 1 run goes for the leg-stump yorker now, and Agar makes himself room and drives to long-off"
467,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to go wide and outside Maxwell's hitting arc, slanting it away from him from over the wicket. It's hard to control the line while doing that, and Maxwell shoulders arms as the ball crosses the tramline"
468,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to deep point"
469,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run slower bouncer outside off, Maxwell tennis-forehands it down the ground to long-on"
470,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run short outside off, slapped to deep point"
471,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide slower bouncer again, over off stump, and Maxwell thinks of playing the ramp to third man, then decides to leave it. It's called wide anyway"
472,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it"
473,"Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the a"
474,"Bumrah to Abbott, 1 run fullish on off stump, steps across and clips it to deep backward square leg"
475,"Bumrah to Agar, no run shortish, close to off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defend it"

477,"Natarajan to Agar, 1 run low full-toss on off stump, jabbed down the ground to long-off"
478,"Natarajan to Abbott, no run in the blockhole, clipped straight back to the bowler"
479,"Natarajan to Abbott, no run nearly a yorker again, pitches just outside leg, beats the flick and hits him on the pad"
480,"Natarajan to Abbott, no run length ball on off stump. No feet from Abbott, just pushes at it and slices it towards backward point"
481,"Natarajan to Abbott, 1 run full on leg stump, driven to long-on. Natarajan may have got a foot to it to slow it down, after which he slipped and landed awkwardly, almost twisting his right ankle. He's fine, though"
482,"Natarajan to Agar, 2 runs good ball. Agar looks to make room and carve through the off side. Natarajan's low full-toss doesn't give him the length to work with, and he ends up dragging it down towards long-on. Just four off the over, so an excellent com"
483,"Thakur to Abbott, 1 run slower length ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket"
484,"Thakur to Agar, 1 run looks for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a wide, reasonably high full-toss. Steered down to third man"

486,"Thakur to Agar, 1 run shortish, slanting away from the left-hander, slashed to third man"
487,"Thakur to Abbott, no run leg-stump yorker, misses the flick and prompts an lbw appeal. Probably sliding down leg"
488,"Thakur to Abbott, OUT slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his gl"
489,"Natarajan to Agar, OUT and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder p"
490,"Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region"
491,"Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run shortish, slanting across the right-hander. Jabbed into the point region"
492,"Natarajan to Hazlewood, no run bouncer, over middle and off. Looks to make room and ramp it over the keeper, makes no contact"
493,"Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole, angling into leg stump. Makes room and squeezes it out to backward point"
494,"Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run full on off stump, clipped to deep square leg"
495,"Thakur to Zampa, no run yorker outside off, and Zampa looks to reverse-ramp and fails to make contact"
496,"Thakur to Zampa, 1 run full outside off, carved to deep point"
497,"Thakur to Hazlewood, 2 runs in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and drives to the left of Kohli at deep point"
498,"Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run shot. Full again, on leg stump, clears his front leg and swipes it down to long-on"
499,"Thakur to Zampa, 1 run low full-toss on leg stump, knuckleball too. Zampa makes room, adjusts for the lack of pace, and jabs it past the bowler, down towards long-off"
500,"Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run length ball outside off, slapped to deep point"
501,"Bumrah to Hazlewood, 1 run leg-stump yorker, almost. Very low full-toss, and he makes room and stabs it towards backward point"
502,"Bumrah to Zampa, no run slower ball, short and wide outside off. Digs into the pitch and turns like an offbreak. Swings too early into the pull, and then the ball turns and rolls down to Rahul"
503,"Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. B"
504,"Maxwell could, and possibly should, have won this game for Australia, but he made a significant contribution for the third successive innings, and he's put that horror IPL far, far behind him. I thought Agar and Zampa bowled really well for Australia too."
505,"10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled In"
506,"10.46pm Right then, that's all from us from this ODI series. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we did. The T20Is will begin soon, and there's a whole lot of other cricket going on around the world right now too (I wonder if this would have seemed possible s"
