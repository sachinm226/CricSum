86,"Good on those who stayed back for this game after all the rain. Must have taken a lot to sit through it all. It's past ten at night and Australia go into the third match with a 1-0 lead. You could argue for Abbott bowling the final over but in a seven-over game, anything can happen."
87,That leaves the series at 1-0 going into Centurion on Friday. The forecast there isn't great either so South Africa will hope the weather clears up so they can have a shot at squaring this. Thanks for your company tonight. Could have been frustrating with the delay but thanks for staying on. We'll see you soon!
88,Australia won by 5 wickets (with 2 balls remaining)
89,"Player of the match is Brad Hodge, AUS"
