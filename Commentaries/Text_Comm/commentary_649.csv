0,Toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat.
1,"Singh to Gilchrist, no run Full, outside off and Gilchrist drives - times it sweetly- and Rohit Sharma dives to his left at cover to make a fine stop. The crowd roar their approval"
2,"Singh to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Streaky edge between the 'keeper and slip! Full in length and well outside off stump, Gilchrist frees his arms and has a slash and the ball races between Dhoni and Sehwag who is standing slightly wide"
3,"Singh to Gilchrist, FOUR runs The white ball has begun to fly already. Again room outside off and Gilchrist throws the kitchen sink at it. A feisty slash and the ball flies over point. The fine leg comes up inside the circle and there is a deep point"
4,"Singh to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Ah! and where does this one go. To the fine leg boundary. Short in length, on the middle and leg and Gilly swivels off the front foot to pull it past the short fine-leg fielder. What a start"
5,"Singh to Gilchrist, OUT Two fours and then he is cleaned up. The middle stump has gone for a walk. A screaming yorker, on the middle stump line and Gilchrist plays all around it. RP is pumped up and Gilchrist walks back to the hutch. Frenetic start to this Twenty20 showdown."
6,"Singh to Ponting, no run beaten. In the zone outside off stump, off a length, Ponting has a lazy push at it but inside the line and the ball teases the outside edge."
7,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run beaten. Some posthumous swing there. The length delivery outside off stump and Hayden stabs inside the line and the ball swings after it passes the stumps. Hence posthumous."
8,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run fuller, closer to the off stump and Hayden gets on to the front foot to drive to mid-off."
9,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run on the stumps, shaping in after landing on a length around middle and off line, Hayden drives on the up but the inward movement the ball went off the inner half of the bat towards square leg."
10,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run back to the corridor outside off stump, moving away with the angle and Hayden allows Dhoni come into play. Four dot balls so far. Will Hayden impose himself now?"
11,"Sreesanth to Hayden, 1 wide One way of not allowing him to impose himself is to bowl a wide. Way outside off, first bad delivery of the over"
12,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run again well outside off, Hayden shoulders arms and looks at the umpire with hope. Nope, its not a wide. Just on the border line."
13,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run again outside off stump, full in length, Hayden tries to drive but the ball was getting away from him and his bat-handle rotates and he ends up mistiming it to right of Sreesanth. End of a tight over from Sreesanth."
14,"Singh to Ponting, FOUR runs edged to third man boundary. Really wide outside off stump, Ponting stretched across and went for a square drive and got a bottom edge wide of the slip fielder. It would have been called a wide had he left it."
15,"Singh to Ponting, no run closer to the off and driven to mid-off"
16,"Singh to Ponting, no run better, on a length, around the off stump and Ponting comes forward to push it towards mid-on."
17,"Singh to Ponting, no run another length delivery, angling away from Ponting who lunges forward, as his wont, and pushes it to cover. Robin fires in a direct hit at the striker's end but Ponting is inside the crease."
18,"Singh to Ponting, FOUR runs Classy shot on the up. Short of length delivery on the off stump, Ponting leans forward and knives it on the up over mid-on. Fab strike."
19,"Singh to Ponting, FOUR runs A sharp bouncer and Ponting is surprised, is late on the pull and top edges it to long leg boundary."
20,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run The bat broke! Short in length, outside off stump, Hayden tries to pull it off the front foot, rather flat-bat it straight, and the ball crashes into the bottom half of the bat and there is a chip of the bat flying to the off side. Broke bat mountain. Err... sorry"
21,"Sreesanth to Hayden, FOUR runs Creamed through wide mid-off. Full in length, outside off and Hayden thrashes it to right of mid-off"
22,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run that imperious Haydos walk down the track. And he had a heave across the line to a length delivery but can't connect"
23,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run well outside off stump, on a length, Hayden again tries to hit on the up and straight and since the ball was slightly wider, he ended up mistiming it to mid-off. He would be better off creaming it through the off side."
24,"Sreesanth to Hayden, SIX runs Massive. Banged in short and Hayden pulls off the front foot over long-leg boundary. It flew deep into the stands. He had got on to the front foot - you could see why Sreesanth bowled the short one - but was quick to swivel around to cream it."
25,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run length delivery, just outside off stump, punched to the off side"
26,"Singh to Ponting, no run Full and outside off, Ponting is beaten, trying to go for an expansive cover drive"
27,"Singh to Ponting, no run on a length, around off stump, pushed to point"

31,"Singh to Hayden, no run yorker on the middle line, Hayden jabs at it and gets a inside edge on to the front boot and the ball rolls away to the off side."
32,"Pathan to Ponting, FOUR runs short in length outside off stump and Ponting rocks back to square cut it past backward point. RP Singh gets across from the wide third man position and throws in a dive but is slow in doing so"
33,"Pathan to Ponting, FOUR runs edged to third man boundary. Full and outside off, Ponting drives and gets a thick outside edge to the third man boundary"
34,"Pathan to Ponting, no run slow off cutter, on the middle and off stump line, driven to midwicket"
35,"Pathan to Ponting, FOUR runs Third one of the over. Runs are coming in a flood here. Full pitched, outside off stump and Ponting plays a lovely off drive to the right of mid-off"
36,"Pathan to Ponting, no run"
37,"Pathan to Ponting, FOUR runs Another one. The fourth of the over. Australia are off to a blazing start. Ponting charges out, Pathan hurls it wider outside off but Ponting adjusts by lunging across to scoop it over cover. Few bounces and over the ropes. What a ballistic start to the game."
38,"Harbhajan to Hayden, no run flighted delivery outside off stump, Hayden leans forward to guide it to backward point"
39,"Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run ah! tries to reverse sweep before he changes his mind. Rather Harbhajan makes him change tack by floating it outside leg stump and Hayden nudges it behind square leg"

47,"Kartik to Symonds, 1 run leans forward to place the ball to cover point"
