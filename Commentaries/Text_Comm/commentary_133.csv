82,"Krunal to Maxwell, 2 runs length at leg stump, dragged wide of long-on with the slog"
83,"Krunal to Maxwell, SIX runs second tier. Krunal drops it short at a leg stump line and Maxwell gets deep in the crease and pumps it high over deep midwicket!"
84,"Krunal to Maxwell, SIX runs and another! This is too easy for Maxwell. Flat, fast, length, no turn. Skids on nicely for him to swing from under it and clear long-on"

87,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run full at leg stump, tapped to long-on"

90,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run length at leg stump, gets out the reverse-sweep and swats it along the floor to sweeper"

96,"Krunal to Stoinis, SIX runs length ball pushed in flat at leg stump. Same old, same old! Stoinis the beneficiary. Front leg out of the way and a swipe from under to clear deep midwicket"
97,"Krunal to Stoinis, 2 runs yorker length at leg stump, jammed out to long-on's right"
98,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run pushes this one wide outside off as Stoinis backs away. He's too far from it to play a stroke. Leaves it alone"
99,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run full and fast on leg stump, nudged to long-on off the toe-end"
100,"Krunal to Maxwell, SIX runs the railings of the second-tier. Krunal is coming apart. Goes seam up and gets a full toss up at thigh height for Maxwell. Pummels it over midwicket"
101,"Krunal to Maxwell, 2 runs full and into the pads. Skewed wide of long-on off the toe-end"
102,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run dropped at third man. Khaleel draws the fury of Bumrah. Short ball outside off, chops from under it to try and get it fine but he's sent this straight to Khaleel. He hasn't had to move, but that bursts through his hand. Seems like he was caught off-guard. Bumrah roars in anger"
103,"Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT drags it straight to square leg. It's possible he's picked the offcutter here, but it's at such an awkward length that he has no control. Hands a long way out as he goes after this and finds the only fielder in the circle"
104,"Bumrah to McDermott, 2 runs full toss on middle stump, looks to power this over midwicket but that's too quick for him. Lobs over the bowler off the high part of the bat and they get two as a result of the poor connection"
105,"Bumrah to McDermott, no run well bowled. Beats him completely. Slower ball at a length outside off, too early into the shot and he's just ended up swatting air"
106,"Bumrah to McDermott, 1 bye short of a length slower ball outside off, and he's beaten yet again. Swings at it. They steal a bye"
107,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs yorker at leg stump, jammed in front of long-on off the toe-end and they steal two"

172,"Stoinis to Kohli, 2 runs falls short of Stanlake at wide third man. Length ball wide outside off and he chucks his hands at this. Once again, seems to have misjudged the pace of it and is through it early. Slices high to the fielder's right"

191,"Tye to Pant, SIX runs clears fine leg! What hands. It takes some doing with his backlift to hit from under the ball. But that's what he's done. It's length, it's climbing up at his thigh, but he just ramps this"
192,"Tye to Pant, FOUR runs pumped! Full at leg stump, gets the front foot out of the way and pummels it between long-on and deep midwicket"
193,"Tye to Pant, 1 wide follows him down leg with a bouncer but it's called wide as he beats him"

195,"Tye to Karthik, 2 runs full outside off, check-drives to sweeper's right"
196,"Tye to Karthik, 1 wide length and very very wide outside off. Left alone"
197,"Tye to Karthik, FOUR runs outside edge! And flying past Carey. Full ball outside off, looks to smoke this through cover but that ball slides away off the surface to get the outside edge"
198,"Tye to Karthik, SIX runs Maxwell leaps to catch outside the boundary but can't chuck the ball back in before he lands on the floor! This is a full toss, Karthik slaps it to deep midwicket's left. Maxwell is running diagonally back to his left and with that angle, he can only end up over the rope somehow. To counter it, he leaps to catch and tries to flick"
199,"Stoinis to Pant, 2 runs sliced to third man's left. Slower ball bowled wide at a length, he looks to slap through cover, ends up carving it"
200,"Stoinis to Pant, 1 run length outside off, seems to be a knuckle ball. Hammers it to long-on's left with a flat bat"
201,"Stoinis to Karthik, FOUR runs beats backward square to the right! Poor ball, but expertly put away. He was tangled there briefly because he had walked down. But it was a slower ball and he had time to swivel and pull this while he was still on the move. Swatted it, and the dive wouldn't do it in the deep"
202,"Stoinis to Karthik, 1 run outside edge short of short third man. Slower ball outside off, looks to drive on the up, it gets big on him"
203,"Stoinis to Pant, (no ball) full toss above waist height! This is disintegration. Looks for the wide yorker, seemingly. It's very wide and is called that first, before the umpire looks to his left and sees the leg umpire signal no-ball"
204,"Stoinis to Pant, 1 run slower ball, short of a length outside off. Mistimed slap on the up to long-off"
205,"Stoinis to Karthik, 1 run slower ball at a length outside off, square drive to sweeper's right"
206,"Tye to Karthik, FOUR runs well wide of long-off. Stunning placement. He finally nails a cover drive after a couple of edges. Slower ball, full outside off, gets to the pitch and in control as he drives firmly"
207,"Tye to Karthik, 1 wide length ball wide outside off, left alone. Walked a couple of steps into the off side, it was still too wide"
208,"Tye to Karthik, 1 run length at the stumps, clipped to the deep midwicket region"
209,"Tye to Pant, OUT taken at point! Pant looks for the reverse scoop and it's the second time in recent memory that he's been out playing that. It was bowled last time, it's a skier for point this time. Third man and two point fielders were in, the shot was on. But he got this full toss off the toe-end. Is there drama left still?!"
210,"Tye to Krunal, 1 leg bye off his helmet. Tye with the bouncer first up and Pandya is in a terrible position for the hook. This flies off the BCCI logo on his helmet. He's on his feet though and they complete the single at square leg"
211,"Tye to Karthik, no run misses a short and wide ball! That was there for the taking. He swatted right under it."
212,"Tye to Karthik, FOUR runs but he finishes what looked like a decent over with a four! Top class. Just top class slog-overs batting from Karthik. He knows the field and he's going to hit it wherever he wants. Walks across this time, gets the overpitched ball with a stride and drills it, almost half a sweep, to long-on's right. It races away, he has no chan"
213,"Stoinis to Krunal, 2 runs slides back in. Completes the second run. Slower ball short of a length delivery wide outside off. Shuffles and wants to pull through midwicket. It's off the toe and to long-on's left"
214,"Stoinis to Krunal, no run beaten! Oh this is close. So close. Full toss wide outside off and it's past the wide marker, but Krunal has shuffled and that is in his arc. It won't be called a wide"
215,"Stoinis to Krunal, OUT Maxwell with the stunner! Stoinis with a nervous smirk, but he's done superbly to make this wicket. A slower ball, pitching outside off and zipping away. Means Krunal will not connect with the slog sweep. It lobs some 15 yards in front of long-on and Maxwell sprints in, slides, and takes it inches off the floor. Then he gets up and"
216,"Stoinis to Karthik, OUT finds long-off! There is life in this Australian bowling still. Stoinis sticks to his strategy of slower ones despite the caning last over. Drops it short of length outside off, gives him no pace as he walks down and all he can do is slap it, flat, straight to Behdrendorff. Dinesh KArthik won't take India home today, but he's broug"
217,"Stoinis to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide called wide! A slower bouncer. Bhuvneshwar jumps down the track and has a heave at it. It is too high."
218,"Stoinis to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run can only get one. Short of a length and rising up outside off. Swats again, makes connection, but it plonks to long-on's right"
219,"Stoinis to Kuldeep, FOUR runs Australia have hung on. Not a bad shot first ball from Kuldeep - walks into the off side and ramps it over short fine."
220,"9:59pm Justin Langer couldn't even manage a smile when Australia got Karthik. An accurate representation of how bad it nearly got for Australia. A remarkable comeback from India via Karthik and Pant, but the top order didn't fire alongside Shikhar Dhawan and that's the difference today. Not to mention their average day in the field. Some misfortune with the rain"
221,"""It's nice to have a bit of luck [with the bat]. It was great fun. Me and Stoin had great fun batting together."""
222,Adam Zampa is the Man of the Match.
223,"10:20pm That is all from our coverage today. An exciting game, accentuated by superb middle-order batting, made interesting by mini-capitaulations by the fielding teams, and given an entire new dimension by the rain, that had most of us all over the place. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. On behalf of Alex and Raghav, this is goodbye."
224,Australia won by 4 runs (D/L method)
225,"Player of the match is Adam Zampa, AUS"
