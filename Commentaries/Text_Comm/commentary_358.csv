0,"India has won the toss and elected to bowl first, because the pitch has been under cover for some time and there might be something for the bowlers early on, says MS Dhoni."
1,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run first ball pitches on a length and is on the stumps, on target straight away. Defended by the batsman."
2,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run slightly straighter this time, Finch pushes it to the on side, but there's no run"
3,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, FOUR runs hint of swing, but that one is wide and full and Finch launches that one over mid on and there's no stopping that one"
4,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run length on the stumps again, Finch pushes it to the now-vacant mid on and takes an easy single"
5,"Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, no run fullish ball well wide of Maddinson, who tries to cut but misses"
6,"Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, FOUR runs first international runs for Maddinson, and that is a decent stroke. Full, pitching just on off stump. Maddinson gets a stride in and drives it straight back past the non-striker's stumps to collect the second four of the over"
7,"Vinay to Finch, 1 run"
8,"Vinay to Maddinson, no run length ball angled across, a little bit of shape there, and Maddinson pokes and misses"
9,"Vinay to Maddinson, FOUR runs but now Maddinson gets his second boundary. The full balls have disappeared so far and this is no different. Overpitched outside off stump, Maddinson gets the lofted off drive out and sends it to the long off fence"
10,"Vinay to Maddinson, FOUR runs fine start this. Opened the face on yet another fullish delivery. This one was wider, so it was carved behind square on the off side, aerially"
11,"Vinay to Maddinson, 1 run length ball closer into the stumps, Maddinson pushes that into the infield and scampers through"
12,"Vinay to Finch, no run length ball on off stump, defended into the off side"
13,"Ashwin to Maddinson, FOUR runs no fear there. Maddinson charges Ashwin's first ball and lofts it over extra cover for a boundary"
14,"Ashwin to Maddinson, 1 run length ball on the stumps, straightening, pushed into the infield and a comfortable single ensues"
15,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs neither spin or seam working here. Finch backs away, gets far enough from the length ball and cuts it in the gap behind square for four"
16,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs another back-away, but this time the ball is fuller and he hits this one through cover"
17,"Ashwin to Finch, no run makes room again, but Ashwin goes closer to the batsman and he hits it straight to cover"
18,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs mayhem early on here. Finch hasn't backed away this time, and Ashwin bowls it full and wide. Batsman gets low and carves it over cover-point and it almost gets to the fence on the full"
19,"Sharma to Maddinson, SIX runs how good does this kid look? That wasn't even that short there, and he has sat back and pulled Ishant Sharma way into the stands. What a blow."
20,"Sharma to Maddinson, FOUR runs India are rattled! This one is shorter, swivel pulls that neatly and powerfully past square leg for another four"
21,"Sharma to Maddinson, no run length on the stumps, defended into the off side"
22,"Sharma to Maddinson, no run bowls wide of the crease, length ball angled into the stumps, defended square on the off side and there's no run"
23,"Sharma to Maddinson, 1 run shorter and slightly outside off stump, turned away nicely to third man, who runs around to collect"
24,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run length ball on the stumps, Finch moves across and clips it into a gap on the legside"
25,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 wide full and way down the leg side"
26,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run legside again, full and on the pads, but Finch finds the fine-leg fielder with his flick"
27,"Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, 1 run length ball outside off stump, Maddinson comes down the pitch and slogs across the line, but he gets an under edge and it goes to deep midwicket"
28,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run fullish on off stump, driven to long on."
29,"Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, FOUR runs and as soon as I say that, Nic Maddinson backs away and carves a full, wide delivery over backward point for another boundary"
30,"Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, OUT gone! Bit of inexperience there you have to think. He was batting so well, playing decent shots, but he goes for an ungainly swipe across the line, and Kumar comes in from around the wicket to angle one in. Maddinson misses, Bhuvneshwar hits the top of off stump and sends the wicket flying. Promising first innings though."
31,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, FOUR runs misfield gives up a four. It was a wide length ball from Bhuvneshwar and Watson played it late. Ishant Sharma at short third man should have stopped it, but he only gets a hand to it and carries on to the boundary"
32,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs short, wide and struck powerfully past a diving backward point to the boundary."
33,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs another boundary off a misfield, almost identical, but Ashwin is the culprit this time. Short, but not as wide as the last delivery, Finch plays it late and Ashwin can't collect at short third man. Slips through for four"
34,"Sharma to Finch, no run closer into the body, Finch chops down on it, no run"
35,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run full and on the stumps, driven along the ground to long on"
36,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run length ball on off stump, defended into the legside and there's time for a run"
37,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs slower ball, full toss outside off stump, driven nicely past a diving mid off for four"
38,"Jadeja to Watson, no run full and flighted, turning away from off stump, Watson has a swing but it turns away from the blade and he misses"
39,"Jadeja to Watson, 1 run full but closer into the stumps, drives it to deep cover this time"
40,"Jadeja to Finch, no run short ball close into the stumps, Finch misses with a cut"
41,"Jadeja to Finch, SIX runs shortish and wide, and Finch absolutely lays into this, backing away to loft it over deep cover for six"
42,"Jadeja to Finch, no run short, fast and wide, Finch makes room again and misses, temporarily losing his balance"
43,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run full toss on the legs, driven along the ground to wide long on"
44,"Vinay to Finch, 1 run shortish and wide, cut away to the fielder but there's enough time for one"
45,"Vinay to Watson, 1 wide full and that will be a wide down the leg side"
46,"Vinay to Watson, OUT jagged back in sharply, off a length and it misses Watson's big off drive. Hits him on the back pad and he has to go. Very good ball"
47,"Vinay to Bailey, no run that was fullish and down the legside as well, but it must have collected pad on the way through, no wide"
48,"Vinay to Bailey, no run length ball on the stumps, defended to the off side"
49,"Vinay to Bailey, OUT short ball on the stumps and Bailey doesn't last long. He pulls that one, but not very well. The mistimed stroke goes straight to the man at deep square leg. Second wicket of the over, and it could be a match-changing one for India"
50,"Vinay to Finch, 2 runs fullish on the stumps, this is turned away into the leg side, and the batsmen take two"
51,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run fullish on the stumps, straightening, turned into the leg side for a single"
52,"Jadeja to Finch, no run backs away slightly and tries to hit that one through the off side, but can't beat the field"
53,"Jadeja to Finch, no run backs away again, but Jadeja follows him and yorks him, preventing a big shot"
54,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run full and flat outside off stump, driven aerially to long on"
55,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run wide and slightly short, Maxwell chops it in front of square to the sweeper on the off side"
56,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run shorter this time, still wide. Cut away to the square sweeper again, on the off side"
57,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs and he's immediately punished. Goes well wide of leg stump from around the wicket, Finch helps it on its way past fine leg"
58,"Ashwin to Finch, 2 wide way wide down the leg side, not even Dhoni can collect"
59,"Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs over the wicket now, and the result is even worse. Fullish on off stump, Maxwell gets a hold of that and deposits it in the stand behind wide long on"
60,"Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs straighter but the result is the same, slog swept powerfully over cow corner. This one's even bigger"
61,"Ashwin to Maxwell, no run a breather for Ashwin, flatter faster, pitching on a length, Maxwell can't get that beyond the bowler"
62,"Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs worst ball of the over, and that's saying something. Thigh-high full toss on off stump, Maxwell eats this up. Launched over cow corner again"
63,"Ashwin to Maxwell, no run"
64,"Kohli to Finch, 2 runs length ball on the stumps, batsman bludgeons that to long on. Oh and an overthrow gives an extra run."
65,"Kohli to Finch, 1 run fullish and on the stumps, driven hard wide of long on"
66,"Kohli to Maxwell, no run length on the stumps, pushed into the off side"
67,"Kohli to Maxwell, SIX runs it keeps raining sixes, and it's in that cow corner area again. Shortish on the stumps, and Maxwell slams that just over the deep midwicket boundary for another biggie"
68,"Kohli to Maxwell, 1 run driven down the ground to long off"
69,"Kohli to Finch, no run on the stumps, driven into the infield"
70,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run a big shot on the off side from Maxwell, but Jadeja turns it away from the bat and he misses"
71,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run makes room and tries to force it through the off side, but Jadeja yorks him and he can't do much with it"
72,"Jadeja to Maxwell, OUT he's gone now. Maxwell was aiming for yet another six, but Jadeja does him in the flight, and he mistimes this to Ishant Sharma at long on, who takes it just inside the rope, I think. Umpires check it and replays show that Sharma didn't touch the boundary. Good catch, and a decent ball from Jadeja. Took the bottom edge I think,"
73,"Jadeja to Finch, no run on the stumps and defended back to the bowler"
74,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run pitched wider from Jadeja, Finch frees his arms and hits it to long off"
75,"Jadeja to Haddin, FOUR runs length ball outside off stump, sliding on. Haddin gets off the mark by opening the face and gliding it past slip"
76,"Kohli to Finch, FOUR runs what a shot. Finch makes room , and that's another boundary. Full and on the stumps, carved powerfully over cover for four"
77,"Kohli to Finch, 1 run closer into the stumps, that length ball is pulled away aerially towards deep mid wicket, where it drops well safe"
78,"Kohli to Haddin, 1 run full and on the stumps, turned away into the legside outfield"
79,"Kohli to Finch, FOUR runs Finch is playing some innings here, but that's poor bowling as well. Kohli strays a length ball onto the pads, Finch swivels, gets it past short fine leg and to the fence"
80,"Kohli to Finch, 1 run backs away and drives a full ball down the ground"
81,"Kohli to Haddin, 2 wide short wide ball down the leg side, Dhoni can't collect"
82,"Kohli to Finch, 1 run length ball straightening on off stump, turned into the legside again and it's collected at wide long on"
83,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs shortish, outside off stump, cut away to the square sweeper on the off side"
84,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run short of a length on off stump, cut away again, but this time third man comes around to collect"
85,"Bhuvneshwar to Haddin, OUT short, wide and out. That deserved to go the boundary, but instead it ends in the wicketkeeper's gloves. Might have moved slightly off the seam, but it wasn't much. Haddin cuts at it, and gets a top edge to the keeper"
86,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, 1 run short again, but closer to the stumps, Henriques cuts but gets a bottom edge onto the pitch"
87,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, FOUR runs short of a length and that's some placement! Finch muscles that ball onto the leg side, and long on and midwicket almost bump into each other on the fence as it dissects them perfectly"
88,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run fullish ball pushed into the offside infield"
89,"Jadeja to Henriques, no run full ball straightening on the stumps, Henriques defends"

94,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run full on the stumps, hit through the off side for a single"
95,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs full on the stumps and Finch has played that inside-out shot so well today. Gets low, and carves it over cover again, right in between the two fielders"
96,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs and a poor ball follows. Full toss on the pads, Finch launches that straight-ish on the leg side. Splits long on and midwicket again"
97,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run full on the pads, driven to long on"
98,"Sharma to Henriques, 1 run slower ball, short and wide. Henriques waits for it and deflects it behind square on the off side for a single"
99,"Sharma to Finch, FOUR runs short of a length, and a little wide. Finch is just preying on anything even slightly off line. Cuts that powerfully, cover sweeper runs around and dives, but can only help it onto the boundary"
100,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run length outside off stump, driven to that deep cover man again, who does enough to prevent two"
101,"Vinay to Finch, 1 run slower ball, fullish on off stump, Finch has a big swing, but mistimes it. Goes along the ground to wide mid on"
102,"Vinay to Henriques, 1 run length ball outside off stump, driven to long off"
103,"Vinay to Finch, OUT he's got him. Can you believe it's off a knee-high full toss? That's floated up to Finch, who misjudges the pace, and is too early on the shot. He gets an under-edge and hits it straight back to the bowler, who seems to hurt his finger as he holds on. End of a very good innings."
104,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, 1 run slower ball on the stumps, turned square on the leg side for a single"
105,"Vinay to Henriques, 1 run full and wide, driven to deep cover who fields it smartly and keeps it to one run"
106,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, no run slower ball, legcutter I think, straightening on middle stump. Batsman backs away slightly and chops it straight to point."
107,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run short ball outside off stump, batsman has a big swing but misses"
108,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, FOUR runs length ball outside off stump, and that's played beautifully late. Just opens the face and third man dives, but it's too fine for him"
109,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, no run fuller and closer to the stumps, tries to open the face again but misses"
110,"Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, OUT and another slower ball does the trick. Shortish one, outside off stump. Henriques tries to pull but again, is too early and a leading edge balloons to point"
111,"Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, 1 run fullish ball, hit along the ground to cover and the batsmen scamper through"
112,"Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run slower leg cutter again, straightening just outside off stump, Faulkner opens the face and gets one behind square"
113,"Vinay to Faulkner, 1 run length ball on off stump, pushed square into the offside infield, where there is a gap"
114,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, 1 run full on off stump, driven to long off"
115,"Vinay to Faulkner, 1 run slower ball short and outside off stump, cut away to third man without much power"
116,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs full wide, and Coulter-Nile goes down on one knee to square drive that past backward point and to the fence. Good shot"
117,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, no run wide-ish yorker again, Coulter-Nile chops down on it but misses"
118,"Vinay to Coulter-Nile, 1 run length ball, slower one on the pads, N C-N tries to swivel pull that away, but has the timing completely wrong. Ball strikes him on the thigh-pad and they run through for a leg bye"
119,"Sharma to Coulter-Nile, no run short ball just outside off stump, batsman aims a big baseball shot but misses"
120,"Sharma to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs full and a little wide, Coulter-Nile tries to carve that high over the off side, but mistimes it. Clears the infield though and a fielder runs back to collect"
121,"Sharma to Coulter-Nile, 1 run full and wide again, driven along the ground to the offside sweeper this time"
122,"Sharma to Faulkner, 1 run short of a length outiside off stump, Faulkner stands tall and swats that cross-batted on the off side, but a diving extra-cover allows only one"
123,"Sharma to Coulter-Nile, 1 run full and slightly wide, driven straight to Raina at extra-cover again"
124,"Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs and they get to 200 with a big one off the last ball. Poor ball from Ishant. It was full on the stumps and right in the slot. Faulkner just swings big and connects well enough to clear the boundary at wide mid-on."
125,"Australia were heading for 220 or more at one stage, but although India managed to rein them in slightly, after Finch's dismissal, thy are still chasing plenty. That big bad top order has to live up to its reputation here."
126,We'll be back with the chase in a bit.
127,"Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are in the middle, all set for the second innings"
128,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run how did that miss the stumps? What a ball to start with. Angled in, pitching on off, and seaming away, Rohit Sharma had no idea about that one. Straight past him to the keeper"
129,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run seaming away on a length again, Rohit's prod can't connect"
130,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run lovely shape from Watson, but this one is too wide to cause any damage. Swinging in the air then seaming away from Sharma"
131,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide saw the swing and got a little overexcited. Angles this way too far down the leg side, and though there was some swing, that's a good-sized wide"
132,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run swinging out to pitch on off stump and straightening, Sharma comes forward to defend"
133,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run swinging away again, but this is wider and short of a length, Rohit opens the face and runs it to third man"
134,"Watson to S Dhawan, no run angled across, and ends up slightly wide. Dhawan cuts that good length ball straight to point"
135,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs lovely pick-up shot, but that was a poor ball to start. Fullish delivery on leg stump, Sharma flicks that off his pads high over backward square leg for four"
136,"McKay to Rohit Sharma, 1 run shortish ball outside the off stump, cut away late to third man"
137,"McKay to S Dhawan, 2 runs that's on the pads as well, but Dhawan hit it much straighter than Sharma, lofting it over the infield to deep midwicket"
138,"McKay to S Dhawan, 1 run drops a few metres short of third man. That was full and slightly wide, Dhawan advances and gets under it, carving it high, but it lands safe"
139,"McKay to Raina, 2 runs fullish outside off stump, Raina lifts that square over the off side and third man has some work to do. Cuts it off just inside the fence."

141,"Watson to Raina, no run short ball wide of off stump, Raina plays at it but misses"
142,"Watson to Raina, 1 run short of a length just outside off stump, driven down the ground on the up"
143,"Watson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs off line that time, and Dhawan gets a glove on it to get it past a diving Haddin. Short ball, chest, high, but on the legside, and that's an easy boundary"
144,"Watson to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball on the stumps, turned into the leg side and into a gap"
145,"Watson to Raina, FOUR runs strays on the legs again, and is punished once more. Raina gets low and flicks it in the air, behind square, well away from any fielders"
146,"McKay to S Dhawan, FOUR runs length ball, quite wide and flayed through the offside by an advancing Dhawan. He shuffled forward and had enough room to free his arms, just beats the mid-on fielder to the fence"
147,"McKay to S Dhawan, FOUR runs that's struck even harder, and through the air this time. Comes down the pitch and turns a length ball into a full one. Opens his face on the drive and sends it above cover for cour,"
148,"McKay to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball on the stumps, he's happy to drop that onto the leg side and take a quick single"
149,"McKay to Raina, FOUR runs length ball on middle stump, but that wristily carved away with remarkable power by Raina. He backed away, but he was still cramped for room by the ball angling in, somehow times it well enough to beat the cover fielder and run to the fence"
150,"McKay to Raina, 1 run length ball outside off stump, opens the face and gets it towards third man"
151,"McKay to S Dhawan, no run length ball on off stump, Dhawan gets it on the inside half of the bat and there's no run"

154,"Faulkner to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball outside off stump, driven through the gap in the offside infield to deep cover"
155,"Faulkner to Raina, 1 leg bye this is straying well onto the pads, Raina probably should have got it to the fine leg fence, but misses with a big sweep, hit his pad and they run through"
156,"Faulkner to S Dhawan, 1 run Dhawan's down the track again, and he drives that straight to extra cover, but they can still run one"

159,"Coulter-Nile to Raina, SIX runs poor line and punished. Short ball on leg stump, Raina steps forward and pulls, and that goes over fine leg after having taken the top half of the bat."

164,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run full and outside off stump, clipped away wristily to the man on the legside fence"

168,"Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run full toss outside off stump, hit to long on for a single"
169,"Henriques to Kohli, FOUR runs good shot first up from Kohli, not much wrong with the ball. Batsman advances and hits the length ball on off stump powerfully back past the bowler and to the straight fence"
170,"Henriques to Kohli, no run length outside off stump,chopped into the pitch and there's no run"
171,"Henriques to Kohli, 2 runs shortish on off stump, pulled well in front of square again and the deep midwicket runs around to keep it to two"

173,"Henriques to Kohli, 1 run length ball on the stumps hit into the legside infield for a single"
174,"Henriques to S Dhawan, FOUR runs short and wide, cut powerfully and the diving deep point fielder can't cut it off. Poor ball, and it was hit hard enough to beat a packed offside field."

176,"Doherty to Kohli, 1 run tosses it up and straightens it on off stump, the batsman drives to deep cover"
177,"Doherty to S Dhawan, FOUR runs pitched wide of off stump and straightening, but not enough. Dhawan rocks back and cuts that short ball in between point and short third man, all the way to the fence"
178,"Doherty to S Dhawan, OUT he's been coming down the wicket so often, maybe Doherty thought this would just be a matter of time. Dhawan bounds down the pitch again and Doherty pitches it short and wide again. If Dhawan had stayed on the crease, he could have cut this one away too. Maybe he thought Doherty would over-correct and bowl the full delivery. Either way, he'"
179,"Doherty to Yuvraj, 1 run fullish outside off stump, driven to long off"
180,"Doherty to Kohli, 1 run full on the pads, Kohli just turns this away to deep midwicket"

194,"McKay to Yuvraj, FOUR runs slower one from McKay, Yuvraj had to wait for that to arrive, was initially looking to power that through the off, instead changes to a cute dab past the dab, a bit of an edge but wide past the keeper"
195,"McKay to Yuvraj, 1 run eases this behind point for a single, chants of 'Dhoni, Dhoni' around the ground"
196,"McKay to Dhoni, 1 run short of length ball on middle and off, clipped towards square leg for a single, Dhoni gets his first run"

228,"Faulkner to Yuvraj, SIX runs six more, length ball angling in towards the pads, Yuvraj can't quite free his arms but still manages to get enough power as he swipes that over deep square leg for six more, 59 off 26 now, what a comeback this is from Yuvraj"
