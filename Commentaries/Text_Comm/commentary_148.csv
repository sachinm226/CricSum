0,"Amir to Head, no run what a gem of a delivery! Fuller and hits the seam and nips away from the batsman late and Head has no clue about that as the ball misses the outside edge by a whisker. Head acknowledges it"
1,"Amir to Head, 1 run tucked to midwicket"
2,"Amir to Smith, FOUR runs beauty. Smith is batting on a different plane here. A fraction short and a little bit wide and Smith covers the off-stump before slapping it gloriously through point"
3,"Amir to Smith, no run covers the off-stump and lets this fullish ball that is angled across from over the wicket to the wicketkeeper"
4,"Amir to Smith, no run shuffles across and lets it go outside off"
5,"Amir to Smith, no run moves across to get on top of this short of a length ball and drops it in front of cover who comes charging in to pick it up. Loud call for no from Smith"
6,"Junaid to Head, no run tries to slap this short of a length ball from the fifth-stump channel into the off-side but gets an inside-edge and chops it"
7,"Junaid to Head, FOUR runs back of a length ball outside off, frees his arms to crunch a cut shot and there is no chance for the fielder at point as he has picked the gap perfectly"
8,"Junaid to Head, 2 runs comes forward to meet the pitch of this length ball and drills it through extra cover"
9,"Junaid to Head, no run good length ball on the fifth-stump channel and Head sticks his bat out. But that one really kicks up from the length area and beats the outside edge as Head sticks his bat out"
10,"Junaid to Head, FOUR runs powerful drive through the off-side. Fuller and outside off and Head leans into the drive as he gets it to the left of the fielder at short cover who is late to get down and the ball sneaks from underneath his hands"
11,"Junaid to Head, no run defended straight back to the bowler"
12,"Imad Wasim to Smith, no run pitched up outside off, Smith presses forward and crunches a drive but straight to cover"

21,"Hasan Ali to Head, 1 leg bye short of a length ball, angled across, tries to flick it away and does not make contact as the ball goes to the slip cordon after hitting the pad. They run the leg bye even as a stifled appeal is made for lbw but that pitched outside leg"
22,"Hasan Ali to Smith, no run tries to slap this short and wide ball but he walked across his stumps so ended up getting cramped for room. That one also bounced more than he anticipated, so he gets beaten"

33,"Hasan Ali to Head, no run predictable response from the bowler. Bangs one in short and angles away, Head arches back and gets his head out of the line of the ball"
34,"Hasan Ali to Head, 2 runs good running, tucks this ball off the backfoot through the vacant midwicket region and they have enough time to hare back for the second by the time square leg can run across and pick it up"
35,"Hasan Ali to Head, no run slower full ball outside off, drills it straight down the ground but this time the shot does not have enough power in it for the ball to beat the diving mid-off fielder"

41,"Hafeez to Head, 1 run whipped off the backfoot down to long-on"
42,"Hasan Ali to Head, FOUR runs short ball, banged in but it is far too short and does not bounce enough to unsettle the batsman as Head swivels around with the pull and the ball goes to the deep midwicket boundary, beating the fielder running across from deep square leg"
43,"Hasan Ali to Head, OUT and the bowler has the last laugh. Hasan Ali celebrates with a jump and a pump of the fists. Follows up the short ball with a fuller delivery outside off, forcing Head to go after it and try to drive through covers. The batsman falls for the trap and gets a healthy edge for his troubles. Rizwan catches it without fuss behind the stumps"
44,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run fullish length ball just outside off, Maxwell leaves it alone"
45,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run angles it in on a length and Maxwell wears it on the pad as he misses the flick"
46,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run short of a length, tailing back in late but Maxwell is sure of his off-stump and trusts the bounce on that one to lift his bat and let it go to the wicketkeeper"
47,"Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs fuller ball outside off and that is a beautiful cover drive. Comes forward and crunches it through the off-side. Did not try to hit it too hard. Just leans forward, uses the pace of the bowler and caresses it"
48,"Hafeez to Smith, 1 run comes forward and pushes this pitched up ball to mid-on who comes up with a clumsy effort, gets half-down to his left and lets it go. Lazy effort"

50,"Hafeez to Maxwell, no run comes down the track to take this on the full and nudges it to midwicket"
51,"Hafeez to Maxwell, 3 leg byes appeal for lbw but not given and the ball races away behind the stumps before it is pulled back before the ropes. Hafeez has decided to review this. Maxwell was coming charging down and misses it and looks to half-heartedly flick. Misses as the ball spins in, hits him on the pad and the ball evades the keeper as well. Replays show that the ball has struck"
52,"Hafeez to Smith, 1 run eased down to long-on off the backfoot"

63,"Hafeez to Maxwell, no run comes down the track to meet the pitch of this flatter ball and pushes it wide of mid-on who makes a good stop"

66,"Hasan Ali to Smith, no run walks across to this length ball and bunts it down the pitch where mid-on fields it"

73,"Imad Wasim to Smith, no run loopy flighted ball that is angled in on middle and leg, Smith caresses it to the leg side"

76,"Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run cut square of the wicket to deep point"
77,"Imad Wasim to Smith, no run flatter fullish length ball, comes forward and pushes it into covers"
78,"Hafeez to Maxwell, SIX runs shot. Springs down the track. The ball is flighted just enough for him to get right on top of that and loft it clean and powerfully over deep midwicket. Clears the boundary by a distance"
79,"Hafeez to Maxwell, 1 run length ball that pitches on leg, tucked to midwicket. Runs the first one hard but has to settle for one as the ball goes straight to the fielder"

97,"Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run quicker ball on middle, turned away to midwicket"
98,"Imad Wasim to Maxwell, OUT knocked him over. Quicker ball from Wsim and Maxwell charges down the track and the bat hits the pad as he tris to force it through the off-side. Does not make contact with the ball as a result and it goes through to take out the stumps"

103,"Hafeez to Wade, 1 run flighted and sliding in on leg, tries to flick it away and that was a chance. It was in the air as it went to the right of the forward short leg fielder. Went quite quickly and he had little to no time to react to it. Very tough chance"

107,"Hafeez to Smith, 1 run flighted on off and middle, comes forward and gently pushes it to long-on"
108,"Hafeez to Wade, no run rapped on the pads and appeal for lbw. Turned down by the umpire. It was a length ball and angling in and Wade was shifting on the backfoot looking to flick it away. Hit on the pad but the angle seems to suggest it was missing leg"
109,"Imad Wasim to Smith, 1 run very full ball that is angled in at a flat trajectory, clipped away to deep square leg"
110,"Imad Wasim to Wade, no run optimistic appeal for caught behind but not given. Wade is done in by the drift that takes the ball away and gets beaten as he sticks his bat at it"
111,"Imad Wasim to Wade, no run another appeal for caught behind and this time given. But Australia have reviewed it. Wade was pretty quick in reviewing it. Pushed across to the left-hander and rushes him with pace. Wade is caught on neither foot and walks across after being opened up as he tries to stick his bat out.

213,"Junaid to Starc, 1 run full and angling on leg, tries to clip it and gets an inside edge on the pad, stifled appeal for lbw. Got a little bit of reverse there"
214,"Junaid to Faulkner, no run short of a length and angling away, keeps lower than expected but Faulkner manages to keep it out to the off side"
215,"Junaid to Faulkner, 1 run fuller ball, angled across, holding its line outside off this time and it is crunched to mid-off"
216,"Junaid to Starc, OUT slower full ball and some good fielding by Junaid. He is having a dream comeback game. It was full and Starc was trying to clip it away but inside-edges it to the pad and the ball just rolls away. He looks for a non-existent single and it does not help that Faulkner is a tad unresponsive. Sent back late and Junaid picks it up and nails a direct hit"
217,"Junaid to Cummins, no run appeal for caught behind and not given. That really seemed out as there was a clear noise. HotSpot shows a clear mark and snicko also confirms the outside edge. It was short of good length and angling away. Cummins was trying to slap it away but there is not quite enough room and he skews it to the wicketkeeper. Pakistan does not have a review left"
218,"Junaid to Cummins, no run"
219,"Amir to Faulkner, no run slower ball, angled across outside off, tries to open his bat face and run it down to third man and does not make contact"
220,"Amir to Faulkner, FOUR runs back of a length on leg stump channel, jumps up and turns it behind square to the deep fine leg boundary"
221,"Amir to Faulkner, no run yorker outside off, dug out straight back to the bowler"
222,"Amir to Faulkner, 1 run fullish and angling across outside off, gets a good stride across and drops it in front of point with bat close to pad"
223,"Amir to Cummins, OUT short ball, tries to hook and gets a top-edge as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Probably got a glove again and it's a very feeble edge. This time, Cummins walks. Does not bother looking at the umpire as he walks away even as the wicketkeeper starts appealing"
224,"Amir to Hazlewood, no run fuller ball outside off, pushes at it without much feet and the bat turns in his hands slightly as the ball goes to point"
225,"Junaid to Faulkner, no run slower back of a length ball, tries to open the bat face and run it down and gets very narrowly beaten"
226,"Junaid to Faulkner, 1 wide short ball, well-directed, sways out of the line. But it is too short and called a wide"
227,"Junaid to Faulkner, 1 run fuller ball outside off, driven firmly to mid-off and he starts off with the single. Jogs initially before realising late that the ball goes to the fielder quite quickly and then ups his pace even as a throw is fired at the non-striker's end that does not hit the stumps"
228,"Junaid to Hazlewood, 1 leg bye tucked off the pads to the backward square leg region and it is vacant there so the wicketkeeper has to run across and gather it. Easy single"
229,"Junaid to Faulkner, no run short of a length, jumps up and drops it in front of point. Faulkner was off for the single but is sent back by Hazlewood and it's the right call in the end"
230,"Junaid to Faulkner, 1 run fullish ball, pushes it off the front of the toes towards mid-on"
231,"Junaid to Hazlewood, no run tries a yorker but ends up bowling a low full toss outside off that is driven firmly but straight to cover"
232,"Amir to Faulkner, FOUR runs unintentional boundary. It was a short ball and he was backing away. But the ball follows him and takes the top part of his bat before flying over wher ethe cordon would have been and into the third man boundary"
233,"Amir to Faulkner, OUT held at point and that's the end of the innings with four balls remaining. It was a short of good length ball but he is in no position to slap it. Skews it in the air to point where Shafiq settles under it easily"
234,"Excellent bowling effort from Pakistan. All credit to Junaid for setting the tone early with a superb opening spell. Credit to Mohammad Hafeez also for some good captaincy and field placements. He gave both Junaid and Amir an extended opening spell. Junaid only bowled in the high 120s for the most part but got the ball to swing prodigiously early. Once early wickets fell, it set up the platform"
235,"6.30pm Thanks Akshay. Pakistan may not get a better chance for a win in this series. They've bowled exceptionally well, couldn't have done too much better. On a slow surface, changes in pace will decide the speed of the game. Australia were forced to make their own pace, and struggled. Pakistan's strength has almost always been their bowling, though. Hafeez and Sharjeel are out there. Starc wit"
236,"Starc to Hafeez, no run full and wide to start, 144.5 kph, left alone nicely. A hint of inward movement"
237,"Starc to Hafeez, no run gets that line closer to off, 145 kph, Hafeez gets forward and blocks to mid-off"
238,"Starc to Hafeez, no run 146 kph, full and wide from Starc. Seeing if there is some swing, there is but not much. Hafeez misses his leaden-footed drive"
239,"Starc to Hafeez, no run edged and dropped! Smith's slips struggles continue. A sitter. Uh oh. Full and wide again, Hafeez goes hard at the ball and gets a thick outside edge which goes straight to Smith at second slip. Gets his hands down near his midriff and shells a dolly. He has dropped an unusual number of catches recently"
240,"Starc to Hafeez, no run defended solidly into the cover region"
241,"Starc to Hafeez, no run 147 kph, fantastic over from Starc. Attacks the stumps with a full length, Hafeez defends back to the bowler. Starc picks up and is ready to breathe fire but doesn't let go of the ball"
242,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run short and wide, there for the cut. Sharjeel just misses it. No worries. If it's there, try. Beaten by bounce"
243,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run oh my. That's a gem. Good length outside off, climbs and climbs and climbs past the outside edge. Wade takes it by his head. Cut that!"
244,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run 130 kph, the line and length that had Sharjeel nicking off in the Sydney Test. Not wide, not close to off. A set of stumps wide. Sharjeel think, should I cut? Ah, no. Left alone"
245,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run close to off on a good length, defended back"
246,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, 1 run there is that backward square leg region in play. Ready to pull anything short, this isn't quite short but he swats anyway to deep backward square leg."
247,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run on the pads, drifting down. An appeal is quickly aborted. Hafeez misses a flick"
248,"Starc to Sharjeel, no run 147 kph, full and straight, Sharjeel gets a thick outside edge which flies towards point."
249,"Starc to Sharjeel, no run 143 kph, full delivery outside off, defended to mid-off. Not much movement"
250,"Starc to Sharjeel, 1 wide strays down leg for an extra. 148 kph."
251,"Starc to Sharjeel, FOUR runs shot! A tad too full from Starc, Sharjeel leans forward, a nice gentle stride. His shot is not gentle. Lovely, clean, flowing drive past Warner at mid-off and through cover. Timing"
252,"Starc to Sharjeel, 2 runs short and wide this time, cuts in front of extra cover for a couple more. Good batting, there to be hit, hit it"
253,"Starc to Sharjeel, no run another clean drive but he finds mid-off. Good batting, depending on timing. Picking the right balls too"
254,"Starc to Sharjeel, no run 149 kph, pacey stuff. Beats Sharjeel for pace, he inside-edges his flick into his pad."
255,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, 2 runs 131 kph, on the pads, flicked down towards backward square leg for a couple more"
256,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run close to off on a full length, defended towards point"
257,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, 1 wide on a length outside off, too wide. Called"
258,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run a big appeal. No says the umpire. Sliding down. Full and down leg, Hafeez falls over as he misses a flick."
259,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, 1 run another edge. Flies down to third man along the ground, just one. Great fielding from Cummins, sprints to his left to save three"
260,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, FOUR runs races away. Again, so strong on the pull. Slightly short and Sharjeel nails his pull through midwicket for four. Picked the length early"
261,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run 134 kph, on a length on leg, defended with a straight bat"
262,"Starc to Hafeez, no run full and straight from Starc, worked towards midwicket. That little bit of swing seems to have ceased"
263,"Starc to Hafeez, no run angled across, lovely line. A set of stumps outside off. Hafeez plays a good stroke, left alone"
264,"Starc to Hafeez, no run another nice leave. Full and wide, asking Hafeez to drive or test Smith again. Hafeez wants neither"
265,"Starc to Hafeez, no run 146 kph, dabbed towards backward point"
266,"Starc to Hafeez, 1 wide full and way too wide, 148 kph, another leave"
267,"Starc to Hafeez, 3 runs too straight from Starc, flicked through square leg for more runs. Three of them"
268,"Starc to Sharjeel, no run good end. 149 kph, full and straight, Sharjeel defends back with the full face"
269,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run Hafeez falls over again. Straying down leg, Hafeez misses a flick. Sliding down"
270,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run falls over again! On a length and straight, Hafeez fails to connect with a nudge into the leg side. The ball hits him high on the body"
271,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run good length outside off, Hafeez leaves this alone"
272,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run lovely line. Around off, Hafeez defends into the off side"
273,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run 135 kph, left alone outside off, lovely bowling. Hafeez refuses to play there. Good from both"
274,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run maiden! Hafeez gets forward and drives through cover."
275,"Cummins to Sharjeel, FOUR runs too straight from Cummins first up, Sharjeel tucks away merrily down to the fine leg boundary. Easy as"
276,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run Sharjeel can't get on top of the bounce and play into the leg side. Struck on the body"

278,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run full and straight, defended towards cover"
279,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run full and straight, another solid defensive block"
280,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run 140 kph, shortish delivery on middle, Sharjeel can't time his pull. Hits straight to mid-on"
281,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run full and straight, a solid block"
282,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, 2 runs too straight from Hazelwood, flicked down to fine leg, Starc dives to his right and saves some runs. Good stuff"
283,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run on a length outside off, left alone by Hafeez"
284,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, no run full and straight, seaming back in, attacking the stumps. Hafeez defends into the leg side"
285,"Hazlewood to Hafeez, 1 run back of a length on leg, bouncer. Hafeez gloves one down to fine leg. Not in control of the pull, beaten for pace"
286,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, FOUR runs full and straight, Sharjeel picks it up and drag-flicks the ball over midwicket. Closed the bat face but picked his area. Not a bad shot at all. Good proactive batting"
287,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run back of a length outside off, Hafeez tries to ride the bounce but lets this one go"
288,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run nice channels. A couple of stumps outside off, Hafeez leaves again"
289,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run full and straight, defended back"
290,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run hustled for pace. Back of a length down leg, Hafeez doesn't connect with his half-pull help down to fine leg. Rapped on the body"
291,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run good length outside off, defended into the off side"
292,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run another maiden played by Hafeez. Full and straight from Cummins, Hafeez defends back"
293,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, no run 126 kph, full delivery outside off, played to the left of short third man. A long run there but Hafeez sends him back. Not good that from Hafeez"
294,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, 1 leg bye much better. On a full length down leg, Sharjeel is struck on the pad, hits the pad and ricochets towards point. Hafeez calls Sharjeel through"
295,"Faulkner to Hafeez, no run 131 kph, angled across outside off, left alone"
296,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 2 runs just clears mid-on. Looks to go over the top, but fails to time the ball after a forward shimmy. Gets enough on that"
297,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 1 run too straight and tucked down to fine leg for one. A lot better way to bat, finds the singles"
298,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, 1 run shovelled down to deep backward square leg for one."
299,"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 run full and straight from Cummins, Sharjeel gets a thick inside edge towards deep backward square leg. The pair want two but are just too slow between the wickets. Should have been two there"
300,"Cummins to Hafeez, FOUR runs top-edged for four. Bouncer on off, Hafeez fails to control the stroke. Hustles Hafeez, who gets a thick edge which flies down to the fine leg boundary. Grazed the helmet too"
301,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run around off on a length, defended"
302,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run good length outside off, defended into the off side"
303,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run nice lines. Close to off on a length, defended back. Not much Hafeez can do to that"
304,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run nice end. But too many dot balls to Hafeez. Good length outside off, played into the off side"
305,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, 3 runs lovely shot. Full outside off, Sharjeel gets forward and lofts the ball nonchalantly over cover for three. Didn't bother keeping it down. Nice"
306,"Faulkner to Hafeez, no run full and straight, Hafeez gets forward and defends, inside-edges the ball into his pad"

308,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 1 run gets a leg side delivery that he tucks down to fine leg for a run"

311,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run full delivery outside off, pushed towards cover from the crease"

313,"Cummins to Hafeez, 2 runs just wide of Wade. Gloved again! A back of a length down leg, Hafeez is late on the pull, flies down towards fine leg. Hazlewood saves two with a dive. Wade is not too far away, diving to his left"
314,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run defended towards cover from the crease"
315,"Cummins to Hafeez, FOUR runs nailed that! Back of a length on middle and leg, a bouncer. Hafeez thwacks this through deep backward square leg with ease. Placed well too"
316,"Cummins to Hafeez, no run fullish on off, 147 kph, pushed towards mid-off"
317,"Head to Sharjeel, 1 run shortish outside off, punched down to long-on with so much ease"
318,"Head to Hafeez, no run beaten on the outside edge. Flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm and beats the bat. No turn"
319,"Head to Hafeez, FOUR runs nicely played. Gets low and hammers his sweep through deep backward square leg. Fantastic timing. Superb placement"
320,"Head to Hafeez, 1 run that's tripe. Short and way down leg, Hafeez pulls down to fine leg. Could have left that and got the extra ball"
321,"Head to Sharjeel, 1 run tossed up on leg, clipped through square leg"
322,"Head to Hafeez, FOUR runs four more! Great batting, Hafeez runs down to the pitch and drills the ball over the bowler for four. Fantastic timing. Good area to hit the ball too"
323,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, 1 run too straight from Faulkner, flicked down to fine leg for one"
324,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 3 runs more runs. Full and straight, easy pickings for Hafeez to flick through midwicket for plenty. A poor ball"
325,"Faulkner to Sharjeel, OUT taken this time! And Australia get Sharjeel. A length delivery outside off, fourth-stump channel. Sharjeel lets the ball come to him, looking for one down to third man off the open face but the ball kisses the outside edge and is easily held by Wade. Sharjeel looking for something too cheeky, that's not his strength."
326,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run good length delivery outside off, pushed towards cover"
327,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run good stuff. Lovely length, fuller than a good length, Azam is beaten on the inside edge and struck on the pad"

338,"Faulkner to Hafeez, no run full and straight from Faulkner, a solid block"
339,"Faulkner to Hafeez, FOUR runs swatted away through midwicket. Full and wide from Faulkner, Hafeez doesn't care. A cross-batted heave into the gap off the front foot. Nowhere near a bad bal"

341,"Marsh to Babar Azam, 1 run good length outside off, slashed down to third man for one"
342,"Marsh to Hafeez, no run some extra bounce. Good length delivery outside off, prodded away towards point. Takes the glove and handle of the bat. Signs of variable bounce"

357,"Marsh to Babar Azam, no run pushed towards mid-on"

383,"Starc to Hafeez, no run a good length delivery outside off, played down towards point"

395,"Starc to Hafeez, 1 run if you can make a run to Warner look easy, it's well judged. Full outside off, pushed to mid-off, Hafeez calls immediately and gets there"
396,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run offcutter on off, blocked"
397,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run saved four. Wow. Full and wide from Starc, Azam laces his drive towards extra cover. Head sticks out a left hand and prevents plenty of runs. Fantastic stuff"

403,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 2 runs dropped! Another sensational effort, but just can't cling on. Extra cover was 10 metres outside the circle. Hafeez wanted to go over cover but the ball squirted off the outside half. Cummins stretches out a left hand but the ball bursts out"
404,"Faulkner to Hafeez, 1 run dabbed down to third man"
405,"Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 run creamed away. Full and wide, driven to the right of Cummins this time. He's probably at that awkward position to cut off the angles?"

409,"Starc to Babar Azam, 1 run nicely steered to third man off the open face. Need more of that"
410,"Starc to Hafeez, FOUR runs in the air but in the gap. Four. Full and wide, swerving away. Hafeez can't hold back his drive, ends up skewing the ball off the outside half through point. Very catchable but not to the fielder"
411,"Starc to Hafeez, 3 runs more runs, full and straight, a wristy flick over square leg. Didn't want to keep that down. More runs"
412,"Starc to Babar Azam, FOUR runs flies down to the third man boundary. Back of a length outside off, Azam gives it all he has, the ball flashes away off the top edge over gully. Think I saw steam from Starc's ears"

421,"Starc to Babar Azam, OUT taken! Not a percentage stroke with third man in place. Back of a length outside off, Azam plays that nicely, sways away from the line, arches his back and gets underneath the ball. Ramps the ball but can't get it over slip, more over gully, and because of that, third man is able to get around and complete a good catch at the third man boundary. May have been a b"

434,"Starc to Malik, no run nice again, full and straight, Malik defends"
435,"Starc to Malik, 3 leg byes too straight, off the pads down to fine leg. Malik was hesitant but came back for the second. The throw was not accurate, the backing-up not great and Pakistan get three eventually. Would have been very close had the stumps been hit at the batsman's end"

450,"Cummins to Malik, 1 wide 139 kph, loopy bouncer over the head, wide called"
451,"Cummins to Malik, no run beauty! Exceptional bowling. Malik reviews the out decision. A big noise, was it bat on pad, or bat on ball? Hotspot has nothing. This is interesting. There is a big spike before the ball reaches the bat, which may indicate that the bat clipped the pad. But that doesn't mean there is no bat on ball. In this case, it was just bat on pad. The back flap was moved fo"

527,Time for the presentation
528,"10.17pm Pakistan completely outplayed Australia today, absolutely no doubt about that. It began by tying down Australia with spin. Changes in pace, cutters, pace off, change-ups. Australia could only manage 220. Pakistan knew what they were doing all along in that chase. Took their time and put the odd ball away. That's all they needed. A clinical bowling performance followed with a clean, effi"
