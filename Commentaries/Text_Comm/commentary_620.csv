1,"Lee to Joyce, no run good start, on middle, flicked into the leg side, a lose throw to the keeper and all very messy as fielders dive to save overthrows"
2,"Lee to Joyce, 1 run pushed gently into the leg side, Lee springs across to field and ends up in a heap as he tries to tumble and throw, all very undignified"
3,"Lee to Loye, no run short of a length outside off, a very loose and unconvincing swish from a man who needs a score to cement a World Cup berth"
4,"Lee to Loye, 1 wide wider and left alone (92mph, 148kph). Not to the umpire's liking, a bit of a harsh call"
5,"Lee to Loye, no run Loye shapes to play a heave/sweep to a ball fractionally short outside off stump and gets hit in the body. Lee follows through to give him some advice, Loye shrugs"

7,"Bracken to Joyce, FOUR runs loose, started wide and swung wider, Joyce punches that through the covers. he didn't look to have timed it at all but the ball keeps trundling and although Hussey dives and pulls it back, it had already hit the boundary marker"

9,"Bracken to Joyce, 1 run wide again, and this wasn't timed and it bobbles out into the covers"

11,"Bracken to Loye, no run short again but also down the leg, off Loye's thigh pad and Gilchrist has to move with a little more speed to take it"
12,"Bracken to Loye, no run Loye takes a big step forward, gets a thick inside edge onto his pad and it loops into space on the leg. A hint of inswing there"

29,"Lee to Loye, (no ball) outside off, too wide to tempt Loye but wide enough for the umpire to signal it"
30,"Lee to Loye, no run Loye goes forward to defend, a little more bounce and it raps him on the bottom hand and trickles into the leg side"
31,"Lee to Loye, FOUR runs much better shot and a real confidence booster, full and wide and driven along the ground between cover and extra cover"
32,"Lee to Loye, (no ball) another attempted sweep which Loye again misses but Lee oversteps by some way"

58,"Lee to Loye, 2 runs full and wide, driven uppishly past a diving short extra cover, a good chase and relay field"

65,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run hint of width this time and some extra bounce too - a late deflection down to third man"
66,"McGrath to Loye, no run perfect line and length from McGrath - he's a bowler reborn after his horror story at Melbourne. So far"

68,"McGrath to Loye, no run tighter to the stumps, and defended solidly back down the pitch"

70,"Lee to Bell, no run drawn onto the front foot, defended to short cover"
71,"Lee to Bell, no run pushed back onto his stumps this time, but same result. Tight bowling, as the run-rate slips below 3.5 an over"
72,"Lee to Bell, 1 run width, and worked down to third man, where McGrath fields to loud and not entirely ironic cheers"
73,"Lee to Loye, (no ball) drawn forward in a tight defence. Played into the covers. Steady stuff from the Aussies"
74,"Lee to Loye, FOUR runs good strike, up and over midwicket for a rare boundary. That was banged in too short, and sits up nicely for Loye to slap out of sight."
75,"Lee to Loye, no run better length, slightly wide of off stump, but then that's the line that has done for Loye this series"
76,"Lee to Loye, no run good finish to the over, good line, good length, Loye comes forward and drives out to cover"
77,"McGrath to Bell, no run a fraction short, but Bell can't get his swivel-pull away"
78,"McGrath to Bell, no run steady stuff once again from McGrath. Keeper's standing up, and Bell is cagily forward to defend"
79,"McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs that's a great strike from Bell! Pitched on middle-and-leg and just a bit too full, and caressed firmly through long-on!"
80,"McGrath to Bell, no run back on a better length, but McGrath's still muttering to himself about that last ball"
81,"McGrath to Bell, no run angled into the pads, but worked no further than short midwicket. Another economical over for Australia"
82,"Watson to Loye, no run good first delivery. Decent pace, hint of outswing, left alone by Loye"

86,"Watson to Loye, no run outside off again, but a tighter line and again no shot"
87,"Watson to Loye, FOUR runs short and spanked! That fizzed over midwicket! When he hits it, it does stay hit ..."
88,"Watson to Loye, FOUR runs two in two balls! A touch more orthodox this time, but the same result. Watson just losing his length at the end of that over, and he lacks the pace to get away with it on this slight pudding of a pitch"
89,"McGrath to Bell, no run lovely ball. Slapped into Gilchrist's gloves, waiting as they were over the top of off stump"
90,"McGrath to Bell, no run another fine take from Gilchrist as Bell aims a flashy drive but misses"

93,"McGrath to Bell, no run classy drive, but not timed"
94,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run lovely over, right on the spot each time. This ball is pushed away off the front foot"

97,"Watson to Loye, no run tighter and fuller, and Loye drives out to the covers"
98,"Watson to Loye, FOUR runs far too much width, and Loye goes down on one knee to slap fiercely past point! Top strike!"
99,"Watson to Loye, no run down on one knee to slog-sweep, and that's a nice strike, but straight to square leg. Good thinking but misses out"
100,"Watson to Loye, no run driving once again, can't beat the field"
101,"Watson to Loye, 1 run more slog-sweeping! That would have been a massive wide, but Loye fetched it from way outside off stump, and toe-ended it over midwicket"
102,"McGrath to Loye, 1 leg bye angled into the pads, Loye sizes up a flick off one leg, but can't get bat on it. Bobbles into space behind square nonetheless"
103,"McGrath to Bell, 1 run good nudge off the hips from Bell, but England miss out on a second run as Hodge misfields at square leg. Neither batsman noticed ..."
104,"McGrath to Loye, no run perfect line and length this time. Pushed respectfully back up the pitch"
105,"McGrath to Loye, no run big scythe of the bat outside off stump, but can't bisect the cover fielders"

112,"Bracken to Loye, no run advances down the pitch in a statement of intent, but played defensively at the last minute"
113,"Bracken to Loye, no run good finish, but that's another productive over for England and Loye, who is advancing towards his first ODI fifty"
114,"Watson to Bell, no run good shot for no runs. Bell opened his shoulders and flailed that down the ground. Mid-off intercepted"
115,"Watson to Bell, no run good response from Watson. Better length, and Bell's best attacking stroke can't beat the covers"
116,"Watson to Bell, OUT Mal Loye is run out. Bell steered it straight to backward point where Hayden picked the ball up and threw down the stumps at the striker's end ... Loye was not in the picture and even had Hayden missed Gilchrist would have had time to complete the run out. The calling was indecisive and t"

123,"Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run similar ball, again Collingwood not tempted"
124,"Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched to mid-off, Hussey picks up and throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end ...the crowd gets excited, the fielders don't and the replay shows Collingwood was well in"

140,"Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run checked drive to mid-on who is too deep to save the one"
141,"Watson to Bell, 2 runs leg side, turned fine, good running to come back for the second as Bell spotted that Bracken had to run round the ball to pick it up"
142,"Watson to Bell, 3 runs driven through extra cover, Hayden had plenty of ground to cover from sweeper, a good throw and Bell has to stretch to make the third"
143,"Lee to Bell, no run Bell pulls his bat inside the line of a ball three or four inches outside off"
144,"Lee to Bell, 1 run pushed to point and again a moment of hesitation from Bell before he set off"

160,"Hogg to PD Collingwood, OUT block and run into the off side, Hussey sprints in, picks up, twists and throws down the stumps at the striker's end and Bell is well short. Australia's fielding coach gives it out and the third umpire agrees. Great fielding but again a sniff of indecision in the calling"

175,"Lee to PD Collingwood, no run full length and tailing in a fraction. Well dug out and pushed to midwicket"

292,"McGrath to Nixon, 1 run, OUT Nixon almost converted that into a yorker but he squirted it to longish-on. Dalrymple turned for the second but Nixon sent him back far too late, the throw was good and Gilchrist took the bails off with Dalrymple yards from safety"

308,McGrath leads the team off to an amazing reception ... he turns just before he is engulfed by the pavilion and waves to all parts of the ground.
309,A really tight last ten overs from Australia that might be the difference between the sides. England were again indebted to Paul Collingwood as well as Andrew Flintoff - the two added 97 for the fifth wicket - but Australia bowled well and fielded superbly. We'll be back at 7.15pm (0815GMT) for the second innings.
310,"After a long series of hearing Boonie and Beefy endlessly (in fairness, Beefy shut up around the middle of the Sydney Test), the Boonie doll has just been served up as a leg-side full toss to Andrew Miller and he smashed it ...straight into Andrew McGlashan who was writing a story and was unaware of other activity."
311,Sajid Mahmood to share the new ball. He too can be wayward ... will he find the spot from the off?
312,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide poor start, a wide well down the leg side"
313,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide and another leg-side wide ... it is swinging into the left hander but Plunkett's radar is well off"

317,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run a yelp of frustration from Plunkett as Hayden jabs down late, the ball shoots into the leg side for an easy one"
318,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, 2 runs banged in, uncontrolled top-edged hook from Gilchrist which he gets away with as it goes very fine. Mahmood was wide at long leg and so never in the frame"
319,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run outside off stump, Gilchrist shapes to smack it through the covers but doesn't get hold of it and thumps it into the pitch and from there to Plunkett"
320,"Mahmood to Hayden, no run loosener outside off stump, Hayden sniffily watches it pass"
321,"Mahmood to Hayden, 3 runs a fraction short, Hayden pulls off the front foot and off the toe of the bat as well"

326,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, FOUR runs lovely shot, too much width and he leaned into that and crashed it past extra cover who never had a chance"
327,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, (no ball) 1 run flicked behind square on the leg, and a no-ball as well"
328,"Plunkett to Hayden, no run Hayden shapes to turn to leg, misses, and is struck in the nether regions. He's hard ... not even a grimace"

330,"Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run steered to Panesar at third man"
331,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, 2 runs rather nonchalant/loose flip over point, high enough to be safe"

333,"Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs well-timed on drive, Panesar at mid-on dives but it's all a bit slow and for show and he's never near it"
334,"Mahmood to Ponting, no run defended back to the bowler"
335,"Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs short, Ponting onto it in a trice and he launches it over midwicket. It plugs in the soft turf and Joyce catches the ball a yard in side the rope"
336,"Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run pushed into space in the covers"
337,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another slower ball, a genuine edge as Gilchrist misread it but it falls a yard short of Flintoff at first slip"
338,"Plunkett to Ponting, 1 wide wide of off stump and that's a very harsh call. Swinging gently away to the slips but Ponting could have played it if he wished"
339,"Plunkett to Ponting, no run he played at that one! Short of a length and climbed past the bat as Ponting went for the pull. He's pumped up"
340,"Plunkett to Ponting, OUT GOT HIM! That's a massive breakthrough, and it's all credit to Plunkett there. Perfect line and length, just outside off and swinging away again, Ponting pushes with hard hands, and Andrew Strauss at slip takes a fine low catch!"
341,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run good start, full and swinging again. Clarke leaves alone"
342,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run lovely ball. Fuller length and late nip off the seam. Climbs over the top of off stump as Clarke shoulders arms"
343,"Plunkett to Clarke, (no ball) slight overstep, but good length again"
344,"Plunkett to Clarke, 1 wide oh dear, that's a bit loose. Wide outside off. Needs to keep concentrating"
345,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run better length and Clarke comes forward in a solid defence"
346,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run wide outside off stump, but that one is allowed to go by. Successful over"

348,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pushed out to the covers off the front foot"

350,"Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run faster and shorter. Up beyond 80mph again and Gilchrist is late on his pull shot. A top-edge bounces down to fine leg"
351,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run width this time, and Clarke has a mow but misses - 147kph that time (91 mph)"
352,"Mahmood to Clarke, no run tidy finish to the over. Climbed off a good length at 91mph again, as Clarke shouldered arms"
353,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide another one down the leg side. These are a bit wasteful"
354,"Plunkett to Gilchrist, OUT massive start for England! Beautiful delivery from round the wicket, tailing in late, beating a loose drive from Gilchrist and clipping the top of off stump! Perfect resumption from Plunkett, do England have the CB Series trophy within their grasp?"
355,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run nice follow-up from Plunkett. Good length, late movement away from the right-hander. Defended"
356,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run good bowling again. Outside off, hint of movement, left alone"
357,"Plunkett to Hodge, 1 run dropped! That was another perfect delivery from Plunkett. Burst off the pitch with late outswing, took the shoulder, and Collingwood at second slip could only parry a salmon leap to his left!"
358,"Plunkett to Clarke, no run defended watchfully. It's all happening here!"
359,"Mahmood to Hodge, no run solid defence. Good line and length from Mahmood"
360,"Mahmood to Hodge, no run back and into line. More rain on the radar ..."
361,"Mahmood to Hodge, FOUR runs banged in and wallop! Too short and Hodge stood tall to thwack that through square leg. Good batting"

365,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run middle-and-leg, shaping away, pushed to midwicket"
366,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run outside off stump, Hodge goes back and across to defend"
367,"Plunkett to Hodge, 5 runs clipped into the leg side - could have been a close call on the run-out, but Joyce's throw is rubbish. Well wide of the stumps and the fielder backing up. Mahmood can't cut off the overthrows"
368,"Plunkett to Hussey, no run short of a length and angled across the left-hander. Hussey opts to leave alone as Nixon fields with a dive towards the slips"
369,"Plunkett to Hussey, no run short of a length. Too short to tempt a strike, but full enough for Hussey to leave alone"
370,"Flintoff to Hodge, 1 run clipped down to third man"
371,"Flintoff to Hussey, no run short of a length but straight as a die and leaping into Nixon's gloves. Hussey withdraws his bat"

375,"Flintoff to Hussey, no run excellent over. Tight and accurate, Hussey content to let it all fly by"
376,"Plunkett to Hodge, FOUR runs short and Hodge stands tall once again to ping that through midwicket. Carbon-copy of his previous boundary!"
377,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run pitch it up he did, and a big appeal! Very adjacent, but a big inside-edge. Better bowling though"
378,"Plunkett to Hodge, FOUR runs wonderful shot. Over-pitched this time, and that's clobbered through the covers. Good counterattack"
379,"Plunkett to Hodge, FOUR runs runs are leaking everywhere now! Too full again, and angled onto the pads. That's a classy shot that fizzes through midwicket"

381,"Plunkett to Hodge, no run back of a length, angled into the pads. Turned into the leg side"

384,"Flintoff to Watson, no run a bit of excitement as Watson is squared up"
385,"Flintoff to Watson, no run bouncer! And Watson was taken completely by surprise! The ball exploded off his glove and flew into the leg side"

393,"Flintoff to Watson, no run Watson back and across to defend"
394,"Flintoff to Watson, no run outside off stump, theatrical leave from Watson"
395,"Flintoff to Watson, 1 run Watson goes to leave alone but is slow pulling the bat out of the way and the ball clips it and shoots through the slips"

397,"Flintoff to Hodge, (no ball) short of a length at 90mph (145kph), Hodge onto his toes, back and into line"

The appeal looked optimistic at first sight but on replay it was very close. He just got a touch of his foot back in time but it took about six replays."

438,"PD Collingwood to Hodge, 1 run full toss driven to long-on"
439,"PD Collingwood to Watson, OUT Oh my word. That is a brilliant catch. It was wide, Watson drove it uppishly to the left of backward point and Dalrymple leapt full length and took a one-handed catch four feet off the ground. There were gasps from the crowd as that was replayed."

474,It's raining again and the umpires are consulting ... the crowd boo and all that happens is that the ball is changed. Liam Plunkett into the attack for his last over. Loud boos around the ground as the umpires take the players off as it gets heavier.
475,10.39pm This is bad for Australia. They should be 187 to win the game if it ends now. And if they are not playing in six minutes time (10.45pm/1145GMT) then it's all over. The countdown begins ...
476,"10.41pm Still raining, covers are on and the stands are emptying fast."
477,10.42pm It's got heavier ... I suspect that is it. England are not celebrating yet but the grins are unmistakable.
478,10.45pm The Barmy Army are singing in the rain but there is now a report that the umpires are saying there are 10 minutes to go before the game can be called off! Utter confusion and a PA announcement would be nice.
479,10.50pm England's dressing erupts into celebration as the announcement comes through confirming that they have won this match by 34 runs and with it the CB Series 2-0.

481,"From me, Martin Williamson, and from my fellow commentators Andrew Miller, Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Andrew McGlashan, thank you for staying with us through the summer and for your kind comments. We are off to have a rest and will be back for the World Cup in a month's time."
482,"Australia now head to New Zealand for three more ODIs starting next Friday in the Chappell-Hadlee series, games which are now more important than they were a week ago. If they lose that series then concerns will continue to grow."
483,"England have not become world-beaters overnight, but they will be confident heading to the Caribbean. A fortnight ago they were a shambles, now they look a unit."
484,"Well, that's the end of a long series and for Australia a defeat which is not the end of the world but which does raise some questions so soon before the World Cup. And a sad home farewell for Glenn McGrath, and a losing one also for John Buchanan."
