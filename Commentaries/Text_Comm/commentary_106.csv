10,"Kane Richardson to Roy, OUT swing for Richardson, Roy chases it on the drive - but plinked off the toe to extra cover!

36,"Stoinis to Malan, FOUR runs short, 134kph but it's leg side and Malan aggressively cracks it the fence at deep backward square for another boundary to end a productive Powerplay for England"
37,"Agar to Hales, OUT round the wicket, angled in and straightening, pops off the leading edge - and Agar dances around Malan backing up to take a smart low catch! He lost sight of it momentarily but took it without drama. Australia break through"

39,"Agar to Morgan, 1 run tossed up on the stumps, Morgan works it with the spin through midwicket to get off the mark"

63,"Agar to Malan, no run flat on the stumps, tapped away"
64,"Agar to Malan, no run pushed through outside off, beats the bat... and Australia go up for the catch behind! Not given but Warner decides to review Gerard Abood's call. Looks to have slid past the edge by some distance, nothing on Hot Spot, so Malan will continue"

66,"Agar to Buttler, 1 run flat, 88kph on off stump, punched through the covers coming forwards"

76,"Stoinis to Buttler, OUT fullish, 129kph in the channel... and Buttler plops it straight into the hands of mid-off! Caught in two minds, I think, not a full-blooded drive, maybe duped by a cutter and he ended up chipping it to man on the ring"

90,"Stanlake to Rashid, OUT banged in short, Rashid pulls and picks out deep square leg! Looked like Rashid was through his shot early, maybe expecting it to be quicker, and it flew off the toe of the bat straight to Stoinis, who clasped it low down in front of him"

123,"Tye to Jordan, SIX runs Jordan whups it into the stands it deep midwicket! Stand and deliver, a meaty hoick across the line and it takes England past 150 in the process. But will that be competitive?"
124,"9.10pm: Well, England did okay to see out the overs, in the end. But having been 94 for 2 in the 10th, they didn't exactly soar through the second half. Can they learn from how Australia bowled (and will they rue leaving out Liam Dawson's spin)? David Warner certainly kept the batsmen on their toes, making a bowling change every over"
125,"9.27pm Welcome back to Hobart. Australia need 156 to secure their second win of the Tri-Series. Funnily enough, England's total is exactly the same as they made in a certain contest in Kolkata...hint"

150,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run another slower ball, arriving with the momentum of a powder-puff, and tapped into the leg side"
151,"Tom Curran to Short, 1 run flicked off the legs out to deep midwicket. England are getting into the groove now after Short's initial flurry"

153,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run another swing of the bat, inside-edged out through square leg this time"
154,"Tom Curran to Short, SIX runs another slower ball, but too short this time from Curran, and Short has all the time in the world to size up his swing of the blade and dump a massive six over the bowler's head. A dent in an otherwise decent over"

163,"Rashid to Maxwell, no run big spin! Maxwell leans forward but is beaten by late dip"

166,"Rashid to Maxwell, 1 run drilled along the ground to complete another brisk over. And England need a breakthrough rather urgently"
167,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 2 runs low full toss, and dropped at deep square leg! Flicked off the toes, and Hales is the culprit, a bit of a goober if truth be told. Is that England's opportunity gone?"

227,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, FOUR runs another slower ball, and pounded through midwicket! He hangs on the back foot, waiting for the ball to arrive, then slaps it, tennis-style into the gap"
228,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 2 runs tucked to leg, and a frantic sprint to make it back for two, keeping the strike and hustling into the 90s ... it's On!"
229,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, FOUR runs clears the front dog, slams the bat through the line, another slower ball is dispatched over the covers..."
230,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 2 runs low full toss, crunched up and over the covers, just out of the reach of the back-pedalling fielder, and they come back for two ... He's probably blown his hundred now!"
231,"Wood to Carey, 1 run on the back foot, a tucked single to the leg side ... and Maxwell is on strike with the scores level!"
232,"Wood to Maxwell, no run banged in short, battered hard into the covers, but can't beat the field"
233,"Wood to Maxwell, SIX runs swung mightily over the leg side, and it plops over the rope for the century! Stunning batting from the Big Show who, frankly, was the only show in town today."
234,"11.03pm Well, that was fun. What a display from Maxwell. Without him, it could conceivably have been close, but with him on top form, it was a rout. He picked the slower balls like a bowl of cherries, and for the first time in T20I history, a player has made a hundred and claimed three wickets in the same match. Let's give David Will"
235,"161 is also the lowest team total in which a player has scored a century, which is a notable stat... beating Scotland and Richie Berrington by one run!"
