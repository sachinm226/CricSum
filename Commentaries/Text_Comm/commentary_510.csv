0,"10.10am There was an utter downpour overnight in Leeds - two-and-a-half inches worth, apparently. The pitch is holding up despite that, but there are sizeable cracks on the wicket already, which doubtless played a part on Ponting's decision at the toss. Runs on the board could be invaluable as the game progresses, and the p"
1,"10.15am The new media centre at Headingley is up and running, and an impressive sight it is too, even if the view it gives of the crumbling old Football Stand reinforces the feeling that this ground is an escapee from the 1970s. Still, one step at a time..."
2,"10.20am There's one notable farewell already underway at Galle, where Murali is holding sway. And there is another happening this week in Leeds, where Rudi Koertzen bows out after 108 Tests as an umpire. That puts him second in the all-time list, behind Steve Bucknor, on 128."
3,"That's a major disappointment for Yorkshire, who had high hopes of attracting the local Pakistani population. It's only eight quid for kids you know. For a slice of history, entertainment and education in the ways of proper cricket, that's a bargain. Drag the whole family down there at once!"
4,"Right, time to hand over to Andrew McGlashan for the opening gambit of the day."
5,Morning everyone...Rudi starts a Test for the last time with a wave of his hand. Mohammad Aamer with the new ball
6,"Amir to Watson, no run wide outside off, going across Watson and left alone"
7,"Amir to Watson, no run even wider this time and he's lucky not to be called"
8,"Amir to Watson, no run that's much better, a beauty from Aamer which bends back from outside off and almost takes the woodwork as Watson shoulders arms"
9,"Amir to Watson, 1 run on the the stumps this time and worked past short leg to get Watson and Australia up and running"
10,"Amir to Katich, no run good line on off stump, Katich gets his shuffle out straight away as he moves across the stumps and defends to the off side"
11,"Amir to Katich, 1 run uses his wrists and works this down to long leg so both batsmen are away"
12,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run a loosener outside off, not much sign of swing there as it's left alone by Katich"
13,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, (no ball) 2 runs full outside off, it's a no-ball, and Katich digs it out down the ground. Mid-off is fairly wide"
14,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, 1 leg bye takes the thigh pad backward of square on the leg side...Pakistan still seem keen to target the leg-stump to Katich"
15,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run on middle stump, Watson plays slightly around his front pad as he defends to mid-on"
16,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run full outside off, not much movement yet for Asif and Watson happily watches this sail through"
17,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run takes a stride across his crease and defends to midwicket...it's obvious to say, but he really doesn't want to miss those. He's right in front of all three."
18,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run solidly defended to mid-on...a fairly gentle start from Asif"
19,"Amir to Katich, FOUR runs nicely played, very full on the stumps and Katich whips it away through midwicket and despite all the rain it scoots over the outfield...Katich will play that shot all day"
20,"Amir to Katich, no run dragged down wide outside and it swings away further...he couldn't have hit that if he tried"
21,"Amir to Katich, no run that's more like it, a cracker outside off that draws Katich into a loose drive and the ball zips away past the outside edge. Good carry to Akmal and no footwork from Katich"
22,"Amir to Katich, no run a touch wide and it allows Katich the freedom to leave it alone"
23,"Amir to Katich, no run he's off fishing today...he didn't need to play at that but had a flat-footed waft outside off and he was lucky not to edge it to the keeper"
24,"Amir to Katich, no run can't draw a shot to end the over and Katich berates himself as he leaves this one alone"
25,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run big appeal from Asif but this is too high as it nips back into Watson and takes him above the flap of the pad...missing the stumps by about a foot"
26,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run full on off stump and brings a drive from Watson which is well-fielded at point by Pakistan's new (latest) captain"
27,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run oh, well bowled, beats Watson as he comes forward and Asif appeals because he heard something but it was bat hitting pad...lovely shape on that ball, though"
28,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run on off stump and this time Watson locates the middle as he defends to mid-off"
29,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, FOUR runs takes the edge, but Watson played it with soft hands and it finds the gap between third slip and gully down to third man"
30,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run pulled wider this time and Watson lets it go through"
31,"Amir to Katich, no run that's a cracker outside off, lifts past the edge as Katich tries to draw the bat inside the line but he was clearly beaten"
32,"Amir to Katich, no run too wide and left alone"
33,"Amir to Katich, no run full outside off, Katich pushes on the move into the covers"
34,"Amir to Katich, no run that's a decent line even though Katich left it alone...drew him across the crease and it's better than being on his pads"
35,"Amir to Katich, FOUR runs full outside off and a hint of swing finds a thick outside edge as Katich drives...flies in the air behind square on the off side and picks another gap"
36,"Amir to Katich, 1 run back of a length at the body and Katich works it into the huge vacant areas on the leg side"
37,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and a well-judged leave...decent carry to Akmal"
38,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run starts too straight and swings down the leg side...poor line"
39,"Mohammad Asif to Katich, 1 run back on off stump and Katich comfortably works it into the leg side wide of mid-on"
40,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run adjusts to the right hander, but too much so as it's well wide of off stump and Watson leave alone"
41,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run makes him defend on middle and off into the on side"
42,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run a beauty! on off stump and shapes away late past the outside edge...Pakistan need a few more of those"
43,"Amir to Katich, OUT gone! A breakthrough for Pakistan and Katich plays for shuffling across the crease as he's caught on off stump with the ball angling towards middle and leg. A strength can often be a weakness and he'll always been danger if he misses the ball - he should have gone like that early at Lord's. Rudi ra"
44,"Amir to Ponting, no run starts with a typical front-foot lunge and there's a big appeal from Aaamer as this straightens and takes the pad...would have gone just over the middle stump"
45,"Amir to Ponting, no run outside off, hint of shape back to the right hander as he leaves alone"
46,"Amir to Ponting, no run pushed across outside off and left alone"
47,"Amir to Ponting, no run he needs the ball to swing back from that line outside off, but when it goes straight it's a comfortable leave"
48,"Amir to Ponting, no run drags the length back a little and Ponting raises the bat high out of the line"
49,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, no run too wide outside off and left alone"
50,"Mohammad Asif to Watson, OUT gone! Another falls. Game on. Asif gets his line and length right, full on off stump with a hint of shape back in, Watson misses his drive and is caught right in front. Ian Gould quickly raises the finger, but Watson isn't happy and takes a while to leave"
51,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run swing outside off but started too wide and it's an easy leave"
52,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run another appeal from Asif as this one nips back at Clarke and takes him high on the pads...there's also an inside edge involved, but things are starting to happen"
53,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, 3 runs that's the place, full on off stump and Clarke gets a thick inside edge through the leg side as goes to drive"
54,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run another great nut outside off, moves away late from Ponting who is caught on the crease and he's well beaten"
55,"Amir to Clarke, no run on middle and defended down to mid-off"
56,"Amir to Clarke, no run good line going across Clarke...it's a good leave because it wasn't far from off stump and Aamer can bring the ball back at the right handers"
57,"Amir to Clarke, no run good bowling...Clarke shoulders arms again and is taken high on the back leg as this one jags back off the seam"
58,"Amir to Clarke, no run this is really impressive from Aamer, tight on off stump and Clarke is having to watch the ball like a hawk to know what to leave...he makes a good call here to shoulder arms"
59,"Amir to Clarke, no run a little wider and it's an easier one to judge for Clarke"
60,"Amir to Clarke, no run big appeal, it looks close as Clarke plays forward but Rudi quickly shakes his head. Was there an edge? Replays suggests not and Clarke is a lucky man to survive. Very lucky"
61,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run wow, what a cracking delivery as Ponting is beaten as he plays forward on the walk...this is a real test for Australia"
62,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, 1 run loses his line a fraction and drifts towards leg stump which allows Ponting to open his account with a nudge through midwicket"
63,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run beaten again! More late swing and this scoots past the edge as Clarke plays forward trying to drive"
64,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run wider outside off and left alone"
65,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run that's just too good for anyone...on a good length and moves late off the seam to beat the outside. Clarke would have been in the form of his life to nick that"
66,"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run full on off stump, drives off the thick outside half of the bat to point"
67,"Umar Gul to Ponting, no run good start outside off as this one shapes back into Ponting who defends to the off side"
68,"Umar Gul to Ponting, 3 runs that's a waste on this surface, dropped in short and Ponting pulls it over midwicket but not with quite enough power to reach the boundary"
69,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run plenty of movement, back of a length and jags into Clarke who is taken high on the leg"
70,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run outside off and shapes away this time as Clarke leaves"
71,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run good ball on middle and off, that seemed to stay down a little as Clarke defended from the crease"
72,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run outside off and left alone"
73,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run good line outside off, shapes away from Ponting as he lets it go"
74,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run that's a good, full length which brings a drive from Ponting...it went quickly to mid-off, but the bowler shouldn't mind him playing that shot in these conditions"
75,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run too short and wide this time and it's easy to leave alone"
76,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run well wide this time, Asif just trying to force it a little and it swings through to Akmal"
77,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run full on off stump, Ponting plays across the ball a fraction as he drives to mid-off"
78,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run defends square on the off side"
79,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run that's an awful shot from Clarke, a flat-footed whoosh (it's a technical term) outside off and he's fortunate not to edge it"
80,"Umar Gul to Clarke, no run another loose shot, this time as he tries to cut but without any conviction and he needs tighten up here"
81,"Umar Gul to Clarke, OUT gone! Australia all over the shop as Clarke is cleaned up. Was the perfect full length and he drove all around it having played two wild shots previously. Gul has pitched the ball up and got rewards"
82,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run good line outside off and well left"
83,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run back of a length outside off and Hussey doesn't play again"
84,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run on leg stump, takes the pad backward of square and short leg cuts off the single"
85,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run what a ball! Unplayable. It landed on a length on off stump and jagged away off the seam sharply. Ponting is well beaten shaping to play the ball to leg on the walk. A belated appeal, but more for the quality of the delivery as he missed it completely!"
86,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run this shapes away as well, but is pitched well wide of off and Ponting is quite happy to leave alone"
87,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, 2 runs Ponting is squared up again! This is turning out to be a great spell from Asif, who pushes the ball fuller and closer to off stump and gets the batsman into a bit of a tangle driving. Some sloppy fielding in the covers allows them back for two"
88,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, no run Ponting lunges forward to defend another full ball to cover"
89,"Mohammad Asif to Ponting, OUT gone! Again Ponting thrusts the left leg forward and swishes across the pad at a ball nipping back in to him. He's struck infront of middle and leg, huge appeal from bowler and fielders and that's out! A remarkable exhibition of the control of seam and swing from Asif, and Australia are"
90,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run full on off stump, shaping back in to North who tucks the ball neatly to mid-on"
91,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run on a length and pushed across Hussey, who can leave the ball easily on the angle"
92,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run Gul gets this one to come back in a touch after pitching, but it lands wide of off and Hussey leaves once again. The length also took the ball well over the stumps"
93,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run sharp movement off the seam away from the left-hander, but not straight enough from Gul and again Hussey shoulders arms"
94,"Umar Gul to Hussey, 4 leg byes now that's too straight, Gul spears one down on a leg stump line and the ball rebounds off Hussey's thigh pad and down to the fine leg boundary"
95,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run left on length by Hussey, and he's worn this one on the thigh as the ball seamed back in to him after pitching"
96,"Umar Gul to Hussey, no run much better line and length to finish the over. Gul pushes one full and straight and Hussey defends back down the track"
97,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run beaten driving airily outside off! Asif floated one temptingly full and wide of off and North just swished at it."
98,"Mohammad Asif to North, 1 run full again, but straight this time and North clips to midwicket to get off the mark"
99,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, 1 run good running from the batsmen as Hussey punches the ball defensively into the gap at cover and calls immediately for a quick single"
100,"Mohammad Asif to North, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! Asif bends one back into the batsman's pads, but that's actually moved too much and also would've bounced over leg stump. Not given, and that's a good decision"
101,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run testing stuff from Asif, who lands the ball on a length on off stump and extracts life from the pitch to have Hussey defending hurriedly"
102,"Mohammad Asif to Hussey, FOUR runs Asif pitches the ball right up and finds decent movement through the air, but the swing takes the ball towards leg stump and Hussey flicks the half-volley infront of square on the leg side"
103,"Umar Gul to North, no run full and pitching outside off stump, North leaves extravagantly"
104,"Umar Gul to North, no run great ball! Gul pulls the line back towards off stump, landing the ball in the channel and finding some movement away to beat North's tentative prod"
105,"Umar Gul to North, no run on a length again, but just wide enough for North to leave alone once again"
106,"Umar Gul to North, 1 run Gul goes full, not quite the yorker but North jammed the bat down to make sure he kept it out. The ball squirted off the inside edge and down to fine leg, but no major alarm"
107,"Umar Gul to Hussey, OUT Hussey goes! Gul strikes! He fired the ball full and straight, snaking it back into the batsman to strike him on the pad. Rudi's slow finger of death begins to rise, and Hussey's got to go. He's unlucky there, replays suggest the ball may have missed leg stump. But look at this, Australia are"
108,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run full, just outside off and Paine presses forward to defend his first ball"
109,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run full, wobbling away and North raises his bat up and out of the way to leave"
110,"Mohammad Asif to North, no run oofh, testing ball from Asif. Full and straight, shaping back in this time, and North plays across the front pad as he tucks to leg. If he misses that, he's plumb"
111,"Mohammad Asif to North, FOUR runs that's a much better way to play the full, straight swinging delivery. North drives straight instead of trying to work to leg and times the shot perfectly to pick up four runs past the bowler"
112,"Mohammad Asif to North, 1 run slipping down towards leg stump, North nudges to short fine leg"
113,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run full, but wide of off stump and swinging further away. Paine is quite happy to leave"
114,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, FOUR runs played with soft hands by Paine. The ball was hooping away once again, but this time landed on off stump as he pushed forward to defend. It struck the outer half of the bat, but he managed to angle it down and play with soft hands to work the ball through gully"
115,"Umar Gul to North, no run back-of-a-length on off stump, North stands tall and pushes defensively towards point"
116,"Umar Gul to North, no run much fuller this time, but right on that off stump line again and this time North is drawn forward in defence"
117,"Umar Gul to North, no run pushed slightly wider, North raises the bat high out of the way to leave"
118,"Umar Gul to North, no run full on middle and off, North drives to the on side but not all that convincingly. The ball takes the inner half of the bat and rolls to midwicket"
119,"Umar Gul to North, 2 runs full and swinging, but that's slipped out as a leg-stump half-volley and is easily flicked down to fine leg"
120,"Umar Gul to North, no run what a leave! That's very brave indeed from North, who raises his bat to leave and must have had his heart in his mouth as the ball nipped just over middle and off. I think we can put that down to a misjudgement as the ball was quite full and straight..."
121,"Amir to Paine, no run good start, landing the ball just short of a good length and he finds some movement through the air and off the pitch straight away as Paine nudges awkwardly to leg"
122,"Amir to Paine, no run well, this is going to be a real test for Paine. Aamer again finds considerable swing back in to the right-hander through the air to strike him on the pad as he tries to flick through leg."
123,"Amir to Paine, no run full and straight, this one doesn't swing nearly as much and is defended back down the track"
124,"Amir to Paine, no run some wobble back in on this one, but Paine is very watchful and pushes defensively to leg"
125,"Amir to Paine, no run appeal from Aamer! But that was more inspired by the quality of the ball than the legitimacy of the lbw shout. Perfect seam position from the bowler and he gets the ball to curve in sharply, but it strikes Paine high on the front pad and was also heading down the leg side"
126,"Amir to Paine, no run and there's the variation, as Aamer gets one to go straight on after pitching. But Paine survives, getting back and across and dropping the ball defensively towards gully"
127,"Umar Amin to North, no run well he's definitely bowling nothing more than medium pace here, but he finds some movement through the air first ball. North watches the ball closely as he leaves alone"
128,"Umar Amin to North, 1 run short and wide outside off, North cracks a cut out to deep cover point"
129,"Umar Amin to Paine, 1 run gently floated up on leg stump, Paine nudges it round the corner to fine leg"
130,"Umar Amin to North, no run full on off stump, North defends back down the track"
131,"Umar Amin to North, no run pushed full and very wide of off stump, North throws the bat into a drive and is beaten on the outside edge. Loose shot there, rather than great bowling!"
132,"Umar Amin to North, 1 run Amin pulls the length back on off stump and North chops to point"
133,"Amir to North, no run Aamer is a different proposition altogether to Amin's medium-pace, as he finds a perfect length on off stump and has North defending awkwardly and only half-forward"
134,"Amir to North, no run swerving away through the air this time, the ball swings appreciably to beat North's tentative crease-bound prod"
135,"Amir to North, no run more movement away, but this time it's pitched well wide of off and North leaves"
136,"Amir to North, no run tempting full ball outside off, and North is drawn forward into the drive, only to be easily beaten on the outside edge. Great bowling"
137,"Amir to North, 1 run edgy looking drive from North, the ball rolls to point where the Butt fumbles and the batsmen seize the opportunity for a quick single. That was a very tight run actually, Butt's throw may well have caught North short if it had been on target"
138,"Amir to Paine, no run full and moving away from the right-hander off the seam, Paine defends watchfully back down the track"
139,"Umar Amin to North, FOUR runs short and wide outside off, a real gift to North and he accepts it gleefully, scything a cut through backward point for a pressure-relieving boundary"
140,"Umar Amin to North, no run much fuller on off stump, North presses forward to defend"
141,"Umar Amin to North, no run full again and well wide of off stump, North taps to cover"
142,"Umar Amin to North, no run on a length, outside off and North pulls the bat out of the way to leave"
143,"Umar Amin to North, OUT Amin strikes! North falls! Kamran holds a catch! Amin picks up his first Test wicket as he lands one on a length around off stump. North could have left that, but he pushed forward in defence and had to reach for the ball. A healthy edge, and Kamran takes a good catch diving to his left. North"
144,"Umar Amin to Smith, no run and he follows that up by spearing the ball well down the leg side! Again some smart work from Kamran behind the stumps, who had to change direction and leap across to leg to make a tumbling save there"
145,"Amir to Paine, 2 runs hooping back in to the right-hander, who watches the ball very carefully and flicks down to fine leg"
146,"Amir to Paine, no run brave leave! And a great delivery too, as Aamer lands one just short of a length and finds massive movement back in to the right-hander. That shot over the top of middle"
147,"Amir to Paine, 1 run more swing from Aamer, this time he sends the ball down much fuller and has Paine nervously nudging through midwicket"
148,"Amir to Smith, no run Smith in trouble first ball! Aamer is finding really sharp movement back in here, and Smith is saved by an inside edge as the ball cannons into his back pad. What a spell. That could have had him bowled or lbw, if not for that thin edge"
149,"Amir to Smith, no run slippery yorker! Well dug out by Smith"
150,"Amir to Smith, 1 run solid defensive push to cover, and Smith calls Paine through to get off the mark with a scrambled single"
151,"Danish Kaneria to Smith, FOUR runs well, that's interesting! Smith bends down into a premeditated sweep to smash the ball through square leg!"
152,"Danish Kaneria to Smith, FOUR runs Smith is fighting back here, and you wouldn't think this is the last over before lunch! This time he skips down the track and whips wristily through mid-on"
153,"Danish Kaneria to Smith, 1 run just a touch too short, and Smith taps towards mid-on, who was deep after that last shot"
154,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run a touch of turn for Kaneria, and Paine stretches forward to smother it into the leg side"
155,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run that has turned quite sharply! Kaneria floats the ball up much fuller, Paine lunges forward to defend but is beaten by the turn"
156,"Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run full and nudged to leg in defence"
157,"Amir to Smith, OUT Done him first ball! That's a beauty from Aamer, snaking back through bat and ball to smash into middle stump! Smith was angling through midwicket but the ball simply wasn't there"
158,"Amir to Johnson, OUT Oh. My. Goodness. What a beauty from Aamer, that was unplayable, full on middle and off and it shaped away and took off stump. Aamer is on a hat-trick!"
159,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run ooh... so close! Fizzing past the outside edge of the right-handed Hilfenhaus, but just eludes the edge ..."
160,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run poking nervously from the crease, but again that beats the edge. Feisty bowling!"
161,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run cracked on the pads by one that nips the other way. Australia haven't put bat to ball once in this over"
162,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run back of a length, cracking the pad once again, half an appeal from Aamer, but more in excitement than expectation."
163,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run a short-arm jab through midwicket. Uneasy stroke, but reasonably effective in the circumstances"
164,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run outside off, no stroke this time"
165,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run back of a length, leaping towards the splice, but defended watchfully from deep in the crease"
166,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run lovely delivery, a full-length outswinger, defended back down the wicket"
167,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run outside off, back of a length, Paine is drawn down to meet the ball, but it bursts off the seam and zips past the edge. Every ball is a hand-grenade!"
168,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run too short to snag the edge, although there's more extravagant movement off the seam. Australia are in a battle, and no mistake"
169,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run that's a horrid stroke, but what can you do? On leg stump, swinging back in, and Hilfenhaus has a wild mow. Akmal makes good ground to gather. He's kept well today"
170,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, 1 run zoinks. That was close! Fast and furious, wonderful seam position as a full-length delivery zeroed in on off stump. A lucky inside-edge gets Hilfenhaus off strike"
171,"Amir to Paine, no run good judgment, as Paine shoulders arms to one that zips over the top of middle"
172,"Amir to Paine, no run dabbed down into the gully with an open face. Watchful batting"
173,"Amir to Paine, 1 run big stride forward, punched into the covers"
174,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run outside off, poked out to point. Another threatening over ticks by"
175,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run short again, but arrow straight. Deflected out to square leg"
176,"Umar Gul to Paine, FOUR runs cut, and cut hard. Poor ball, excellent shot. Short and wide, and swinging away. Paine doesn't miss out"
177,"Umar Gul to Paine, (no ball) banged in short, Paine swings into a pull but doesn't make contact, as Gul's no-ball plague returns"
178,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run on the pads, deflected out to midwicket"
179,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run wicket-to-wicket. Defended on off stump with a full face of the bat"
180,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run good-length outswinger, defended with utter caution"
181,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run a back-foot drive, good-looking shot, but can't pierce the covers"
182,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run zippy outswing, touch that if you dare! Hilfenhaus does not"
183,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run more outswing, but starting on a wider line, and no stroke offered"
184,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run more outswing,no stroke"
185,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run banged in short, and well directed. Hilfenhaus gloves an attempted pull to short leg. Keeps it down well"
186,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, no run fizzing through to the keeper with a Wasim-esque whirl of the arms. The comparisons are not overstated"
187,"Amir to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs good delivery, shaping back in towards middle stump, but met with a sturdy full face"
188,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run defended on the back foot, straight back down the wicket"
189,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run blocked out to cover"
190,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run deflected defence out to midwicket"
191,"Umar Gul to Paine, 1 run dabbed defence into the covers, and a quick single ensues"
192,"Umar Gul to Hilfenhaus, no run bouncer. Negotiated easily enough, with a half-crouch"
193,"Umar Gul to Hilfenhaus, no run half-forward into a leaning defence. Another over survived"
194,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run and he nearly snakes it through first ball! Mischievous late movement on a tight off-stump line, and Paine chops down on the ball late"
195,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run outside off, big swing through the air, no stroke offered"
196,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run outside off, too wide to tempt a stroke, but lots and lots of swing to keep the batsmen nervous"
197,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run there's no playing that! Shaping down the leg-side as Paine charges down the track, but zipping past the gloves and through to the keeper"
198,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, 1 run hangs back in the crease this time, and plops a defensive push to cover"
199,"Mohammad Asif to Hilfenhaus, no run down the leg-side, clips the pads, Kamran tidies up"
200,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run outside off and swinging away. No contact there"
201,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run a loose waft to another outswinger. Too wide to be playing at really, and Paine knows it"
202,"Umar Gul to Paine, no run much better length and a tighter line. Kamran appeals as the ball ghosts past the edge, but no-one joins him"
203,"Umar Gul to Paine, 2 runs, OUT another one bites the dust, and what a way to go! Paine chopped down to third man, and sized up a tight third run, but a sliding stop and a fine flat throw came in from Umar Amin in the deep, and though Kamran Akmal had to gather high to remove the bails, he did so with Hilfenhaus's bat"
204,"Umar Gul to Bollinger, no run outside off, seaming back in, Dougie's first stroke is... umm ... unconvincing"
205,"Umar Gul to Bollinger, 2 runs that's much more convincing! A hint of width, and a firm clunk of willow as Bollinger picks the gap at extra cover"
206,"Mohammad Asif to Paine, OUT and that, as they say, is that! A regulation outswinger, a loose leaning waft of a cut, a thin snick, and Kamran Akmal wraps up an outstanding effort from Pakistan by claiming the decisive catch"
207,"That is, incidentally, the lowest score by a team electing to bat first since 1957, and their seventh-lowest first-innings total of all time ... and their lowest for more than 50 years."
208,"Eighty-eight all out. By Junkers, that's a collapse and a half. Pakistan required barely a session to skittle the Aussies, and my goodness, if they can't win their first match against them for 15 years from this position, when will they ever?"
209,"Some heavy cloud surrounding the ground and it's getting a bit dark now. But no rain, as yet. We have a change in the bowling, as Mitchell Johnson comes on for the first time"
210,"Johnson to Farhat, 1 run full on middle and off, the ball is nudged to leg and they set off for a quick, scrambled single. Tight, but that was well-judged"
211,"Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs leg-stump half-volley, and Butt times a little nudge through leg sublimely to pick up yet another boundary and take his team's score past 50"
212,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on a length and just outside off, Butt aims a checked-drive to point"
213,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run similar ball to the last one, this time Butt steps forward and drives on the walk back to the bowler"
214,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run very full on off stump, Butt aims a watchful inside-out drive to mid-off"
215,"Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs great shot! Butt forces through backward point as Johnson offers up some inviting width outside off stump. Butt didn't try to hit it too hard, he just stood up tall and made sure he timed the shot well, placing it between gully and point"
216,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run on a length on off stump, Farhat stands at the crease and punches back to the bowler"
217,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, FOUR runs full, wide and slashed! This is actually quite fortunate for Farhat, he threw the bat at it and edged but right in the gap. It went low and soon hit the ground too, but there wasn't much control in the shot"
218,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run Hilfenhaus pulls the length back outside off and this time Farhat has nothing to do with it"
219,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run on a length again, Farhat chops defensively towards point"
220,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run that's a cracker of a delivery! Perfect line to the left-hander, who was surely expecting this to curve back in. The seam was positioned to shape the ball back in, but it just held its line to beat the outside edge"
221,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run much fuller, and a toe-ended drive goes towards mid-off"
222,"Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs squirted off the outside edge, right in the gap and down to third man for four! Nothing going Australia's way here. It was a good delivery from Johnson, which had Butt squared up as he pushed at it from the crease. But he played it with soft hands, sending the ball down and putting i"
223,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run similar length, but this one is wider of off and Butt is quite happy to leave in what is in all likelihood the last over before tea"
224,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run fuller, on off stump and punched back towards the bowler"
225,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run Johnson bends his back to find pace and good carry off a length ball outside off, but it's a waste as the ball is left alone"
226,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run half-volley on off stump, Butt times a caressed drive into the covers but picks out the extra cover fielder"
227,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on a length and straight, pushed defensively back to the bowler"
228,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run Hilfenhaus comes round the wicket and he's not quite loose yet, as the ball slips out as a gentle knee-high full toss. Farhat is taken by surprise and can't make anything of it, however"
229,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run Hilfenhaus finds his length very quickly, to draw a defensive backfoot punt from Farhat"
230,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, 1 run that's slipping down the leg side with the angle and eased down to fine leg"
231,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run fullish, on off stump and defended towards the covers off the front foot"
232,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs Salman Butt has lost none of his timing during the break, caressing this through cover point off the back foot, a really elegant forcing stroke off the back foot"
233,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run nudged into the leg side"
234,"Johnson to Farhat, FOUR runs that's not a great start, Johnson flings down a leg-stump half-volley and is thumped through wide mid-on with a firm flick of the wrist"
235,"Johnson to Farhat, 1 run this is leg-side as well, and turned down to fine leg for a single as Hilfenhaus sprints round on the rope"
236,"Johnson to Salman Butt, no run back-of-a-length on off stump, Butt hops onto his toes to defend back towards the bowler"
237,"Johnson to Salman Butt, 1 bye Johnson's really lost his radar, this time the ball is arrowed way down the leg side and Tim Paine does well to get some glove on this one, although he can't quite cut it off"
238,"Johnson to Farhat, no run on a length and straight, tucked to midwicket"
239,"Johnson to Farhat, no run just short of a good length on off stump, punched firmly towards mid-off"
240,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run pushed down towards leg stump, but can't get it away though"
241,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run dropped! Hilfenhaus surprised Butt with some movement away through the air to take the leading edge, but seemed equally surprised himself when the ball was popped back towards him. He lost his footing as he leaned forward to try and take the catch. That must be so frustrating for Aus"
242,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, (no ball) and now he's over-stepped, looking for some extra life out of the pitch outside off but straining just a little too much"
243,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run pitched up outside off, Butt times a drive towards cover but picks out the fielder"
244,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run cracked just behind square on the off side, but again he picks out the fielder"
245,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run decent bouncer from Hilfenhaus, well-directed although there's not much in the way of pace on the ball and Butt sways out of the way with time to spare"
246,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 1 leg bye pushed leg side with the angle again, Butt can't lay bat on the glance but gets a single to keep the strike"
247,"Johnson to Salman Butt, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, tucked off the hip through the leg side for a single"
248,"Johnson to Farhat, no run dug in short outside off, Farhat sways back and watches the ball go past"
249,"Johnson to Farhat, no run pitched up this time, and much closer to off stump. Farhat leans forward and punches a drive to extra cover"
250,"Johnson to Farhat, no run on a length and straight, pushed to mid-on from the crease"
251,"Johnson to Farhat, no run Johnson is starting to find a consistent line now, but his length is still just a touch too short. This one is back of a length on off stump again, and is chopped to point"
252,"Johnson to Farhat, no run slightly wider of off this time, Farhat is tempted into a slash outside off, slapping the ball down towards gully on the bounce"
253,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run good length from Hilfenhaus, slightly full and on off stump. Butt watches it carefully and keeps bat and pad together as he defends back down the pitch"
254,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 2 runs nicely driven on the up through extra cover, but Australia have Michael Clarke out as cover on the off side boundary and so it's cut off"
255,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run Hilfenhaus pushes his line straighter, and Butt responds with a firm defensive push back to the bowler"
256,"Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, OUT gone this time! Australia finally get the breakthrough as Hilfenhaus pitches the ball nice and full, finding significant swing back in to the left-hander. Butt shaped to whip through the leg side, but was done in by the swing and the wide angle from round the wicket. The ball snuck past"
257,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run Hilfenhaus finds nice shape away from the right-hander, who pulls his bat well inside the line as the ball goes past him"
258,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run on a length on off stump, Ali defends back towards the bowler"
259,"Johnson to Farhat, 1 run just a bit too straight from Johnson, and he's nudged to midwicket for a single"
260,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run full and wide outside off, still no swing whatsoever for Johnson. Ali leaves well alone"
261,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run on a length and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
262,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run short of a good length and outside off, Ali looks to force the ball through the off side but can't time the backfoot punch"
263,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run fuller, but far outside off stump once again and Ali is quite happy to leave"
264,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run Johnson finally gets the line and length right with the last ball of the over, but Ali keeps his eye on it to defend from the crease"
265,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run back of a length outside off and coming in through the air and from the angle as Hilfenhaus stays round the wicket to the left-handed Farhat. Defended"
266,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run similar ball, pushed defensively towards point this time"
267,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run Hilfenhaus is keeping things tight here, zoning in on off stump and Farhat can only defend"
268,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, 1 run just a hint of width outside off, Farhat drops the ball down between gully and point and they sprint through for a quick single"
269,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run Ali fishes at one outside off and he's lucky not to get an edge on this. Hilfenhaus seems far more comfortable bowling to right-handers, though he just dismissed Butt!"
270,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run nice ball again, curving away through the air and squaring Ali up a touch as he defends from the crease"
271,"Johnson to Farhat, 1 run Johnson is struggling to keep things consistent here, again dishing up a leg-stump half-volley with the first ball of his over. He's got a defensive field to work with, though, and so the ball is cut off before the boundary"
272,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run short and rising into the ribs, Ali fends to leg on the hop"
273,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run on a length, but landing outside off and going further with the angle and easily left alone"
274,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run good length again, slightly straighter this time and Ali tries to work the ball through the leg side but picks out mid-on"
275,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run full, landing on off stump and Ali, who certainly hasn't settled yet, aims a nervous looking push into the leg side"
276,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run this one jags away off the seam a touch after pitching, but not enough to take the edge as Ali pushes his weight back and plays the ball towards point with soft hands"
277,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run full on off stump, Farhat cracks a drive out of the middle of the bat but straight back towards the bowler, who stops it in his follow-through"
278,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run tempting line and length outside off, Farhat leans forward and pushes at the ball with no great conviction and is beaten"
279,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run full and just outside off once again, played down towards gully"
280,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run short on middle and leg, Farhat ducks quickly underneath the ball as it flies over him"
281,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run on a length on off stump, Farhat comes forward and defends to cover"
282,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run good finish to a good over, Hilfenhaus keeps to that choking line and length and Farhat can only defend"
283,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs and that just sums things up. Johnson dishes one up full and wide, Ali squirts a drive through gully and down to third man to get off the mark"
284,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run Johnson pulls the length back, Ali leaves"
285,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run full and straight, Johnson still searching for the merest hint of swing, but there doesn't seem to be any on offer so far! Nudged to mid-on"
286,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run short of a good length on middle, Ali stands tall and rides the bounce as he defends back down the pitch"
287,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run pushed through on a length wide of off stump, and Ali leaves once again"
288,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs better ball to finish, but he's ultimately been punished for it as Ali nudges with soft hands through gully, taking the bottom hand off the bat. And that's the lead for Pakistan"
289,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run good line, a hint of swing"
290,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run nice one, skimming past the edge as it angled back in from wide of the crease"
291,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, 1 run outside off, dabbed through third man to keep the strike rotating"
292,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run over the wicket to the right-hander, who pulls the bat inside the line at the last minute"
293,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run stands tall to jab into the covers off the back foot"
294,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run swinging away from wide of off stump. No stroke offered there"
295,"Johnson to Farhat, no run on the pads, flicks fine but Paine pounces to cut off the run"
296,"Johnson to Farhat, no run bouncer, not straight enough to threaten, but Farhat can't time his cut"
297,"Johnson to Farhat, 3 runs that's a sweet stroke, up on the toes to capitalise on a bit of width outside off. Well placed with a back-foot push, out towards the cover rope"
298,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run wicket-to-wicket. Defended on off stump"
299,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run now that is a jaffa! Six of them an over and Australia will be in business. Pitches on off, holds its line and climbs off the seam, and misses the edge by a splinter"
300,"Johnson to Azhar Ali, no run too full, passes the off stump on the full in fact. No stroke as Paine gathers with a grimace"
301,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, no run banged in short from round the wicket. Farhat flinches as the ball passes his shoulder"
302,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, 1 run better delivery, late jagging inswing on a good length, but Farhat watches it onto the bat, and plays out to point"
303,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run bouncer again. Ducked"
304,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run outside off, Azhar holds his bat inside the line"
305,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run good delivery, attacking the stumps, and defended"
306,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 3 runs booming outswing, and Azhar is drawn into the stroke. Never in control as he slices through gully, but he gets away with it"
307,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run bustling delivery, defended on the back foot"
308,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run fenced out to gully with an angled bat. Good energy from Bollinger"
309,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 4 byes there's no cutting that off! Given as byes which won't please Paine, although his feet were caught in treacle as he dived in vain down the leg-side"
310,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 1 run turned to midwicket with a closed face. One to the total, as Pakistan become the first team to reach three figures in this Test match"
311,"Bollinger to Farhat, 2 runs whipped onto the leg-side, and straight enough to elude the clutches of mid-on"
312,"Bollinger to Farhat, no run in the channel outside off stump. No stroke offered, and that's another over done and dusted"
313,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run sharp swing, but pitches a foot too short to snag the edge of the bat"
314,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run once again, it looks impressive but Azhar doesn't get close to touching that"
315,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run and again. Pitch it up a foot, and Hilfenhaus could be in business with that line"
316,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run an attempted inswinger, but Azhar was alive to it, and defended well"
317,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 2 runs more swing, Azhar has a dart, and doesn't quite middle it. Swept up on the extra cover boundary"
318,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs too full this time, and angled gently through the slips. No third man, and an expensive end to the over"
319,"Bollinger to Farhat, (no ball) another over-step, that won't amuse the skipper either"
320,"Bollinger to Farhat, 1 run punched into the covers, one more to the total"
321,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run that's a good nut, angling across the right-hander and straightening after pitching. Just misses the edge"
322,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run too short, too wide. No threat of a shot that time"
323,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 1 run good ball, a slippery yorker, but that is excellently dug out by Azhar who jabs down and steals a run through fine leg. Anything but bat and he was a goner"
324,"Bollinger to Farhat, 4 byes a poor follow-up. A wild bouncer and Paine has to sprawl the other way this time. To no avail"
325,"Bollinger to Farhat, FOUR runs and so ends a curate's egg of an over. Mostly rotten, as a leg-stump half-volley is flicked on its way"
326,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 1 run better from Hilfenhaus, who finds some wobble on a full stump-attacking length. Squeezed into the covers"
327,"Hilfenhaus to Farhat, 1 run deflected down to fine leg"
328,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 2 leg byes on the pads again, the right-hander's pads this time. Australia are really struggling with their line"
329,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, (no ball) bouncer. But too short"
330,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run ripper. That one bursts off the seam and eludes the edge again"

332,"Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run attempted yorker, easily dug out"

334,"Bollinger to Farhat, 1 run blocked out to point"
335,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 2 runs right up to the bat, and punched smoothly through mid-off. Calm accumulation here"
336,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run drilled back at Bollinger's toes, and deflects out to mid-on"
337,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run nothing doing there. Left alone"
338,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run too wide to lure a stroke"
339,"Watson to Farhat, no run good length, gentle drift back into a back-foot defensive"

341,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run big stride, and a solid block"
342,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run squared up by a good wicket-to-wicket delivery. But well enough played in the end"
343,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run too much width outside off, no stroke there"

347,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run punched drive to extra cover"
348,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 2 runs unconvincing, but effective. A thick outside-edge as Azhar drove at a tight wicket-to-wicket delivery. Backward point couldn't intercept but third man jogged round to tidy up"
349,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run banged in short, but that's safely negotiated"
350,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run blocked back up the pitch"
351,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run left alone outside off, no stroke offered"
352,"Watson to Umar Amin, no run that's a bit ordinary. Two feet outside leg"

356,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 2 runs clipped off the hip, to fine leg"
357,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, 2 runs driven on the up, but finds the gap in the covers. Not timed, but they all count"
358,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run outside off, and beaten by what might have been a slower ball. If it was, it beat me too. Didn't get up much either way"
359,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run crashing drive to a full-length outswinger, but cover scampers round to field"
360,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run outside off, no stroke this time"
361,"Bollinger to Azhar Ali, no run worked into the leg-side, but doesn't beat the field"
362,"Watson to Umar Amin, 1 run finds the gap to rotate the strike"

367,"Smith to Umar Akmal, no run good length to launch his spell, driven hard back to the bowler"
368,"Smith to Umar Akmal, SIX runs crikey, this chap doesn't hang around. One sighter, and then Akmal clears his front leg and slogs over long-off!"
369,"Smith to Umar Akmal, no run a comically diligent forward-defensive to follow up that blow"
370,"Smith to Umar Akmal, no run forward once again, and defended"
371,"Smith to Umar Akmal, 1 run full toss on the hip, and whipped through square leg"
372,"Smith to Umar Amin, no run another full-toss, but he gets away with this one. Midwicket tidies up"
373,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run a real wild start, slung way outside off stump and that isn't far from a wide...not a great way to begin"
374,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 2 runs closer to the batsman and he doesn't need much invitation to have a flash as he gets a thick outside edge that lands short of gully who manages to get a hand on it"
375,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, 2 runs full outside off and what follows is a shambles...Katich misfields in the covers then Umar Akmal slips in the crease as he tries to turn for a third"
376,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs oh, that's a proper shot...stands tall and cuts at the top of the bounce through backward point. That flew off the bat and already Pakistan are away"
377,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run full outside off and there's no holding back from Umar as he drives powerfully to mid-off"
378,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, (no ball) 2 runs oh my goodness, what's going on here...Umar has an almighty heave at this delivery which is full outside off, it was a no-ball but I'm not sure he'll have heard the call, and he skies it to cover. To cap it all there's nearly a run out. Blimey"
379,"Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run what's this? Oh, it's a leave. How mundane from Umar."

391,"Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 leg bye short ball on leg stump, Amim tries to flick it round the corner but it takes the thigh pad towards long leg"
392,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, FOUR runs nice shot, on leg stump and flicked away through square leg with good timing...oh dear, Johnson tries to get his boot on the ball but can't manage to stop the boundary"
393,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, no run adjusts his line but goes too wide outside off this time and left alone"

407,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, no run pushed across the left hander outside off and left alone"
408,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, FOUR runs poor line on leg stump and it's flicked down to fine leg...the fielder is too square to cut it off so an untidy end to the over for Hilfenhaus"
409,"Johnson to Malik, no run fuller outside off, Malik comes onto the front foot and defends to cover"
410,"Johnson to Malik, no run back of a length on middle and off, played back to the bowler"
411,"Johnson to Malik, 3 runs that's a lovely shot, leans into a straight drive and sends it past the stumps down the ground...the outfield is slow so it pulls up before the rope"
412,"Johnson to Umar Amin, no run short outside off and swings away further as Amim pulls his back inside the line and that was still on the rise as Paine took it"
413,"Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 run wrong line, on leg stump and flicked in the air down to long leg...there's a man catching at leg gully but it was well wide of him"

417,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, no run pitched up on off stump, driven hard but straight to mid-off"
418,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, 1 run this one wobbles back in to the left-hander ever so slightly, but enough to take the inside half of the bat and ricochet between bat and body to square leg"
419,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run fired full and wide, left well alone by Malik. Hilfenhaus seems far more comfortable bowling to right-handers, his action means he finds much better shape away from the bat on this line"
420,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run full, wide and left alone once again"
421,"Johnson to Umar Amin, FOUR runs cracking drive from Amin! That looked pretty classy, as Johnson over-pitched on off stump and Amin just leaned into a cover drive, striking the ball right underneath his eyes and away to the cover boundary"
422,"Johnson to Umar Amin, no run speared down the leg side by Johnson, Amin can't get a touch on it"
423,"Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 run on a length, just outside off, and Amin hops back to drop the ball into space in the covers. They take a quick single"
424,"Johnson to Malik, no run full, wide and angled across Malik, who raises his bat up to leave"
425,"Johnson to Malik, 3 runs drilled down the ground by Malik as Johnson pushes the ball very full once again. The ball slows up on the heavy outfield and is hauled in just before the rope"

427,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run back of a length and well wide of the batsman, who watches the ball closely but plays no shot"
428,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run fuller, and aimed straight at middle and off. Malik tucks to midwicket"
429,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run some shape away through the air for Hilfenhaus, Malik steps forward and drives hard back to the bowler"
430,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run very full and straight once again, this time Malik tries to whip the ball much harder to leg, but again picks out the close midwicket fielder"
431,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, no run great line and length from Hilfenhaus, catching Malik neither forward nor back and beating the outside edge. Cries of anguish echo from the Australian slip cordon"
432,"Hilfenhaus to Malik, 1 run full and straight to finish the over, clipped into the leg side"
433,"Johnson to Malik, no run bouncer from Johnson to start the over, well-directed but Malik bobs underneath it in good time"
434,"Johnson to Malik, 1 run short again, this time rising up into Malik's ribs. The batsman shuffles across to the off side and glances down to fine leg on the hop"

437,"Johnson to Umar Amin, no run fuller still, and straighter. Amin punches carefully to mid-on"
438,"Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 run tapped to mid-on, where Khawaja, who is on as a substitute fielder, has a shy at the stumps as the batsmen scamper through for one"
439,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, no run on a length, width offered outside off but Amin forces the ball straight to point"
440,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, FOUR runs languidly driven by Amin, picking the gap at cover and timing the shot superbly as the ball evades the chasing fielders."
441,"Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, OUT but now he's gone! Hilfenhaus sent down a well-directed bouncer, which Amin saw early and tried to duck underneath. But he left his bat poking straight up like a periscope, the ball struck the side of the bat and looped gently to square leg, and Amin's got to go. He was starting to look r"
442,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, FOUR runs well, Kamran's going to go after the bowling from the start. Hilfenhaus sends one down back-of-a-length and wide of off stump and Kamran hangs the bat out to guide it down past gully to third man. He's off the mark with a boundary"
443,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run similar length, slightly closer to the stumps this time and Kamran leaves alone"
444,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run same again to finish the over, and Kamran raises his bat to leave"
445,"Bollinger to Malik, no run not the greatest start, a gentle full toss outside off stump, but it's driven straight to point"
446,"Bollinger to Malik, FOUR runs over-pitched once again, this one was a half-volley and Malik wasn't going to miss out again. He bends into a smooth drive to send the ball rocketing to the cover point boundary"
447,"Bollinger to Malik, FOUR runs Bollinger is having a very erratic start to his day, as he dishes up a juicy leg-stump half-volley this time. Malik leans over the ball and clips in the air over square leg for another four"
448,"Bollinger to Malik, no run on a length, pushed through outside off stump and Malik is quite happy to leave this one alone"
449,"Bollinger to Malik, no run full again and very wide, Paine leaps to his right but it's so wide he can't quite get to it and can only parry the ball to gully"
450,"Bollinger to Malik, no run on a length, outside off and left alone again. This time the ball gets to Paine on the bounce, and he does well to complete a clean take"
451,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run width offered outside off, Kamran keeps his weight back and thrashes the ball square, but point dives to his left and pulls off a really good stop. Great fielding, saved four runs"
452,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run outside off, moving further away after pitching and left alone"
453,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run fuller this time, again Hilfenhaus finds appreciable movement away from the bat but Kamran is able to leave safely"
454,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run zoning in on off stump, drawing a forward defensive stroke from the batsman"
455,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run this one is aimed at middle and leg on the angle, but moves towards off stump and has Kamran slightly squared up as he drives on the up towards mid-off"
456,"Hilfenhaus to Kamran, no run rising delivery outside off, Kamran leans back into an expansive cut but is beaten on the top edge"

459,"Bollinger to Kamran, (no ball) again Kamran plays with an angled bat, guiding the ball to backward point off the front foot this time. Bollinger has just overstepped as well, and is called for a no-ball"
460,"Bollinger to Kamran, FOUR runs short, just outside off and Kamran gets up on his toes to carve through cover. Total confidence in the shot, and he slammed the ball well infront of square too. Great sound off the bat as he connected"
461,"Bollinger to Kamran, no run very full on off stump to follow, drilled to mid-off"
462,"Bollinger to Kamran, no run on a length on off stump, worked wristily to point"
463,"Bollinger to Kamran, (no ball) spicy ball from Bollinger, who bends his back to extract something extra from the pitch and strikes a painful blow on Kamran's inner thigh. But he's over-stepped once again, so another run in the extras column"
464,"Bollinger to Kamran, no run dropped by Hussey at gully! The extra ball was full and wide, Kamran slashed an uppish drive straight into Hussey's midriff, but the ball just bobbled in and straight out, he hardly got a hand to it. Not great cricket all round there, from ball, bat and field!"
465,"Watson to Malik, no run loosener to start, floated down gently on a length outside off and pushed to cover off the back foot. Watson really lumbered to the crease there"
466,"Watson to Malik, no run fuller, straighter, and tipped the man close in at midwicket"
467,"Watson to Malik, no run Watson finds some movement away through the air, but the ball lands well wide of off stump and Malik wisely wants nothing to do with it"
468,"Watson to Malik, no run punched hard to cover off the back foot, where Smith at extra cover pulls off an athletic diving stop"

472,"Bollinger to Malik, no run back of a length on off stump this time, Malik rises up to cover the bounce and plays down towards cover point. Kamran wants a run but he's quickly sent back"
473,"Bollinger to Malik, no run full, but wide of off and left alone. Good wheels on this delivery, it landed on a full length but really carried through to Paine, who took it above his head"

476,"Bollinger to Malik, (no ball) full, angling across the right-hander who plays with soft hands to send the ball to gully. And that isn't quite lunch yet, as Bollinger has over-stepped yet again."
477,"Bollinger to Malik, no run full toss outside off, tapped to mid-off"
478,"Watson to Kamran, FOUR runs not a great start from Watson but imperious from Kamran, a touch short and wide, a real loosener from Watson who could barely drag himself up to the crease, Kamran stood tall and thrashed it through point for four"
479,"Watson to Kamran, no run much better from the bowler, that is what he's done well all series really, dob it up on a full length, find a touch of swing, Kamran defends"
480,"Watson to Kamran, no run ugly cricket here, Watson again creaks up to the wicket, shoves it wide outside off, Kamran has a half-hearted flay and misses"
481,"Watson to Kamran, no run lovely delivery, full, swinging away, even seaming away, past the outside edge of Kamran"
482,"Watson to Amir, OUT Watson on a hat-trick! Aamer gone first ball! Looks like a poor decision on replay but first up looked stone dead. Fullish as usual from Watson, swinging in and Aamer shouldered arms and watched in horror as the ball snaked back from outside off and crashed into his pads. Rudi gave him out quickly"
483,"Bollinger to Malik, no run shoved it short from Bollinger, defended by the batsman up on his toes"
484,"Bollinger to Malik, 1 run shortish again and defended towards the square leg region for a single"
485,"Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run this time Bollinger has a big appeal but he won't get this, fullish and crashing into Gul's pads, but it pitched outside leg"
486,"Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run misdirected by the bowler, swinging it a fraction but starting too far down the leg side"
487,"Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run very neatly played by Gul, offering a full face to a full delivery and patting it tidily to point"
488,"Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run this time it's shorter, outside off stump and left alone"
489,"Watson to Malik, no run well, Watson won't join Australia's last great fast-medium, instead it's dished up full outside off and left firmly alone"
490,"Watson to Malik, no run draws a shot from Malik this time, very confidently pushed to cover"
491,"Watson to Malik, 1 run Watson drifts a fraction on to the legs, Malik clips it away towards midwicket with a minimum of fuss, and with the field set deep, they take a single"

493,"Watson to Umar Gul, no run this is a touch misdirected from Watson, shoved down the leg side and Gul leaves alone"
494,"Watson to Umar Gul, OUT Bowled him! Watson strikes again - five wickets for him! Sensational stuff, this is inspiration to every senior Sunday-league player, Watson is doing nothing more than bowling full and straight, Gul plays all around it as it gently swings in a fraction, catches the inside edge and cannons on t"
495,"Bollinger to Malik, 1 run almost a mix up here as it was pushed to long off, the batsmen wanted to and were half-way through the second before Malik changed his mind and had to come back to the bowlers end, just in time"

497,"Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, (no ball) no ball here from Bollinger but it was a swift one, short and climbing towards Kaneria's helmet, he threw his gloves up in front of his face and the ball whistled past"
498,"Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, 2 runs Kaneria gets a couple here, flicking a full ball of his legs wide of a diving square leg fielder, in the air, but he collects two"
499,"Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run Danish has found his range by the looks of things! This time he offers a full face, pushing it calmly to mid off, and then he wanders up the pitch to pat down a suspicious area. Looked very professional"
500,"Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run outside off stump, Kaneria happy to leave alone"
501,"Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run smart cricket from Kaneria - and it's not often you say that about a Pakistan batsman, here he just defends a full ball calmly to see out the over"
502,"Watson to Malik, 2 runs good cricket from Malik, and would have earned four if it weren't for a brilliant, inelegant sprawling stop by Bollinger on the fine leg boundary, Malik skipped down the wicket and flicked it fine"
503,"Watson to Malik, FOUR runs crucial runs for Malik, crucial runs, a touch short and a touch wide from Watson, Malik picked the gap and third man and threaded it through for a welcome boundary"
504,"Watson to Malik, no run Malik was edging wide of leg stump but Watson's wily medium pacer was well pitched full and straight and defended"
505,"Watson to Malik, no run big effort ball from Watson, really bent his back to get up towards 80mph, Malik gives it due respect and blocks"

514,"Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run swing again for Watson, but it's outside off and Kaneria studiously leaves alone"
515,"Watson to Danish Kaneria, 1 run Kaneria is looking masterful out there, shades of Salim Malik and he flicks this off his pads down to long on. Quite why a long on is posted for Kaneria is beyond me"
516,"Watson to Mohammad Asif, 3 runs Asif now into the act, fullish and swinging into the pads a gentle pace, Asif flicks through wicket, timed it fairly well and is rewarded with three"

518,"Watson to Mohammad Asif, FOUR runs swipe and four! Asif has found a way to counter the dark arts of Shane Watson - a flat footed slog. Pitched on a length outside off, Asif pulled it over a leaping mid on for four"

It was full and a slower ball, Asif found a leading edge the looped agonisingly towards mid off, it landed short but Kaneria set off for a single, Asif sent him back but the throw came in and caught"
530,"Gnasher is barely able to contain his excitement about the chance of a two-day Test and you can read his views on it all in his end-of-innings bulletin, which will be ready shortly."
531,"With the best part of two sessions remaining today, could we see a repeat of this? Given how Pakistan bowled first-up, I wouldn't entirely rule it out ... ps ... how is that match a full ten years old already?"
532,"Useful little partnership for the final wicket there - in the end both teams will be fairly happy with how the Pakistan innings unfolded. Wickets are falling rapidly under the dank Headingley skies so Pakistan's 170 lead is plenty. That said, Australia know if they can build a lead of 100 in their second innings, it could b"
