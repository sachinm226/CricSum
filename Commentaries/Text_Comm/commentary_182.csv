It has taken India to what seems like a par total. We will be"

214,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run swept away for one"
215,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run moves across to sweep, would have got a wide down the leg side had he not mis-hit this for one"
216,"Ashwin to Watson, OUT Nehra takes the nervous catch. India must think they are home and dry. Watson, under pressure, goes for the big sweep, and Ashwin's bounce takes the top edge. It is a skier, and Nehra somehow manages to never look comfortable under those. At short fine leg, he makes"
217,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run short of a length, across him, beats the cut"
218,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run pushed down to long-on for one"
219,"Ashwin to Wade, 1 run paddle-sweeps this from middle and leg for a single"
220,"Hardik to Wade, 1 run short, chest high, pulled down to long-on for one"
221,"Hardik to Lynn, SIX runs he has hit this into the road. What an age we are living in. Looked like he couldn't spin two minutes ago, but has monstered this medium pace for a six over long-on. Just a hit-me length ball"
222,"Hardik to Lynn, 2 runs wide length ball, drilled to deep cover, Kohli fields excellently, Lynn comes back for two. He sees a good throw, and dives in to make his ground"
223,"Hardik to Lynn, 1 wide tries to go full and wide out of his reach. Too wide, though. Called"
224,"Hardik to Lynn, 1 run wide length ball again. This would have been a wide had Lynn not drilled it to wide cover for one. One bounce to Kohli"
225,"Hardik to Wade, 1 leg bye goes across the stumps to look for a ramp, the slower ball beats him, but they get a single"
226,"Hardik to Lynn, OUT Pandya has his wicket. The wide line has worked. This is another wide he has ruined. Second time in this over he has gone and played a delivery that would have been called a wide. The last time he nearly got caught at deep cover, this time he finds extra cover. Yuvraj"
227,"Ashwin to Wade, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven to long-off for one"
228,"Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 run full, on the pads, worked away for the single"

231,"Ashwin to Wade, 1 run flatter delivery, could have hit this past pint, but finds that man. Gets just the single"
232,"Ashwin to Faulkner, no run full, on off, hit back to Ashwin. Another good over of spin"
233,"Hardik to Faulkner, 1 run low full toss, hit to deep cover for one"
234,"Hardik to Kane Richardson, no run well bowled. Yorker just inside the tram line on the off side. Squeezes it under the bat"
235,"Hardik to Kane Richardson, 4 runs another wide ball disturbed by an Australian batsman. Dug out to point, and Ashwin shies at the stumps and gives away four overthrows. Can't blame Ashwin. Poor backing up from square leg"
236,"Hardik to Kane Richardson, 1 run this is seriously ordinary cricket from Australia. Richardson has borrowed a ladder from somewhere and reached this wide ball to take a single. Almost like they are worried about India's over rate. Just going out of their way to play every wide Pandya is b"
237,"Hardik to Faulkner, 1 run another wide played at. Faulkner gets a single off the edge"
238,"Bumrah to Faulkner, 1 wide wide down the leg side. Now this you can't play even if you want to"
239,"Bumrah to Faulkner, SIX runs slower ball, Faulkner has picked it early and slog-swept it over midwicket for six. Short square boundary. Works for Faulkner"
240,"Bumrah to Boyce, 1 run yorker, middle and leg, dug out for one"
241,"Bumrah to Kane Richardson, 1 run full and straight, driven to long-off for one"
242,"Bumrah to Boyce, 1 run slower ball, would have been a wide had he not tried to ramp this. Gets a single to short fine leg"

248,"Nehra to Boyce, 1 run slower full ball, driven to long-off for one"
249,"Bumrah to Boyce, no run makes room to try and hit over cover, is beaten outside off"
250,"Bumrah to Boyce, no run moves well across the line to try to work it to fine leg, is beaten, and somehow Bumrah misses the stumps"
251,"And just a note on the Finch dismissal. On the first replays it looked like it pitched well in, and then the replays later showed the ball pitching outside leg, with a shake just as the ball lands. I am just not convinced with the replays shown later"
252,India have taken lead in this T20 series with a win on their Republic Day. Punches and counter punches flew until spin became slightly dominant. Kohli showed his class with a risk-free 90 off 55 balls. Never did he look in a hurry or played any funky shots. Dhoni and Raina supported him well. Au
