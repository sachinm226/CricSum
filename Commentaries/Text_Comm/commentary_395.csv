0,"5.15pm England win the toss and bowl, no real surprise there. Tim Bresnan has a sore elbow so misses out and England play both James Tredwell and Samit Patel. No rest for either Stuart Broad or James Anderson. Still no game for Woakes, either."

12,"Finn to Warner, no run dragged a little short and wide but Warner can't take advantage as he flashes and misses at a cut"

15,"Anderson to Wade, no run full outside off, carries through at ankle height to Kieswetter"
16,"Anderson to Wade, no run short of a length at the body, Wade defends a touch awkwardly off the back foot"
17,"Anderson to Wade, no run how do you play that? Beats the outside edge again with late movement from a full length and Wade is left prodding"
18,"Anderson to Wade, no run squared up by a ball starting around leg stump that he tried to work through the on side and a leading edge rolls into the off side"
19,"Finn to Warner, 1 wide extravagant seam movement and bounce as Warner is beaten playing another cut...but it's a fraction too wide"
20,"Finn to Warner, no run now beaten on the front foot by a full delivery...this is fantastic bowling"

36,"Finn to Warner, no run straighter this time and a well-timed flick goes straight to midwicket"
37,"Finn to Warner, FOUR runs edged! Batsmen need some luck in these conditions and Warner finds some as he Chinese cuts past the stumps and a diving Kieswetter...the delivery nipped back into him to cramp him for room"
38,"Anderson to Wade, 1 run defends with an open face to backward point and they scramble a single which leaves Warner diving for his ground"
39,"Anderson to Warner, 2 runs pulled down shorter and it's whipped away through square leg"

48,"Broad to Warner, no run full on middle and leg, played to mid-on"
49,"Broad to Warner, 1 run dropped into the off side and that's a well-judged single"
50,"Finn to Warner, FOUR runs well played by Warner who is starting benefit from the hard graft as he drives through the off side and Bopara can't quite haul it in"

52,"Finn to Wade, no run outside off and left alone"
53,"Finn to Wade, 2 runs edged! Did it carry to Tredwell at second slip? Yes, it looks as though it just got there so that goes down as another drop. Was a tough, low, catch but he seemed a little slow to move"

61,"Broad to Wade, 1 run worked away from leg stump into square leg"
62,"Broad to Warner, 2 runs dropped! Another one goes down and this time it's Samit Patel at third man as Warner goes up and over. Patel steadied himself under the catch but it was a pretty poor effort in the end. Cook is not impressed"

64,"Tredwell to Wade, 1 run on the stumps, clipped through midwicket"
65,"Tredwell to Warner, no run full, sliding down the leg side, goes back and taps to short fine leg"
66,"Tredwell to Warner, OUT tossed up, misses with the sweep and gone! Warner often looks a little uncertain trying to work slower bowlers around and he falls to a plumb lbw decision, the ball was full and straightening on middle and he didn't get anything on it. Hawk Eye showing pretty big turn"

88,"Tredwell to Wade, no run tossed up outside off, pushed into the covers"
89,"Tredwell to Wade, OUT flighted, spinning past the bat as Wade advances and stumped! Lovely dismissal for Tredwell, who lured the struggling Wade out of his crease, beat him with the turn - in fact almost bowled him - and Kieswetter was alert to whip off the bails"

94,"Broad to Smith, no run pitched up outside off and Smith frees the arms, drives straight at extra-cover"
95,"Broad to Smith, 1 run length ball, gets forward and pushes wide of extra-cover, Smith calls one but Clarke sends him back ... and Bopara's shy misses, giving them an over-throw"
96,"Broad to Clarke, OUT dabbed towards point ... and a direct hit from Eoin Morgan runs out Clarke! Australia are in disarray here, trying to push for singles as England crowd round like vultures. Clarke ran the gauntlet but was left well short by an excellent throw as Morgan fielded on the boun"

105,"Finn to Smith, no run full and straight, gets forward well in defence"
106,"Finn to Smith, FOUR runs slightly overpitched outside off, nicely timed drive back down the ground, bouncing over Finn and beating the dive at long-on"
107,"Finn to Smith, 2 runs nudge off the pads, they chance a second and get it, bit of a misdirected throw from midwicket forces Kieswetter to take above his head"

116,"Patel to Hussey, 2 runs tossed up and lofted over extra-cover, the sweeper has to run around and they get two"
117,"Bopara to Smith, OUT loosener, down the leg side - and Smith gets a tickle through to Kieswetter! Australia hit another bump in the road and that's a gimme for Bopara, whose gentle medium pace somehow foxed Smith"

128,"Patel to Hussey, 1 run tossed up outside off and driven square for another single"
129,"Bopara to Hussey, OUT Bopara strikes again as Hussey feathers through to the keeper! It was another innocuous delivery, slightly short and wide, Hussey tried to dab it through the off side and nicked off. Bopara's golden arm could probably refloat the European economy right now"

139,"Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run full outside off, whipped with the turn past a diving midwicket"
140,"Tredwell to Pattinson, no run another big appeal for lbw. This is close and they review. It's pad first as Pattinson lunges forward. This will be tight. But the impact is umpires' call and it was also missing off stump. So excellent decision by Ian Gould"

152,"Tredwell to Pattinson, no run big appeal, both for a catch and lbw I think, but it's not out to either. Plenty of turn for Tredwell as Pattinson played against the spin. The ball ended up a slip but not off the edge. It also pitched outside leg"

155,"Bopara to Pattinson, no run chopped into the off side"

180,"Finn to Pattinson, 1 run cuts again and gets a bottom edge that bobbles towards Kieswetter"
181,"Finn to Bailey, 1 run bouncer from Finn and it's pulled with pretty good control down to fine leg"
182,"Finn to Pattinson, OUT big appeal and not out...England are convinced Pattinson edged the slower ball as he heaved to leg. No reviews left for England. There was certainly a noise. Oh, hang on, the umpires are conferring about whether this has carried. So it could be out after all. This isn't"
183,"Broad to Bailey, no run opens the face and finds backward point"
184,"Broad to Bailey, FOUR runs lovely shot, Bailey helps the ball backward of square on the leg side...was just a fraction short and he rolled his wrists nicely to beat deep square"

194,"Anderson to Bailey, FOUR runs and they close with another boundary as Bailey drills Anderson straight down the ground and he's given Australia something to bowl at"
195,"The last two overs cost 25 runs and, on a pitch offering help for seam and spin, it means Australia just have a chance. However, England are still strong favourites to make it 4-0. Excellent bowling by Tredwell and Bopara and we'll be back shortly with the run chase."
196,"In absence of Brett Lee, it will be Clint McKay to take the first new ball"
197,"Evening all. The Australians are back on the pitch, waiting for Alastair Cook and Ian Bell. Has George Bailey given them enough to defend? Probably not, though if Xavier Doherty can't outbowl James Tredwell, then they really are in bad shape. Ah, look, there's Mitch Johnson, on the field in place of"

205,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, 1 wide pushed through outside off, no swing and that's a wide"

224,"McKay to Cook, no run slightly wider, good length again, Cook leaves this one"
225,"McKay to Cook, no run teasing line again, there's a sound on the way through and Dar gives it - but Cook immediately reviews. He's confident he didn't hit the ball and replays show a big chunk of bat on pad"
