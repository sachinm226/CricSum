0,9.30am Steven Smith has won the toss and Australia will bat
1,"Abbott to Finch, no run short and wide from Abbott to start, a poor ball. Finch goes after his cut but chops it towards the keeper first up. Good stop by de Kock."
2,"Abbott to Finch, 2 runs straighter this time, full and straight, brings this back but Finch squeezes his drive to backward square leg for a couple."
3,"Abbott to Finch, OUT bowled im. One down already. Too exuberant from Finch. But a beautiful delivery too. The perfect delivery to Finch, akin to Southee's ball against Finch in Auckland. Full, just outside off, and so Finch thinks he can hit on the up. But the ball jags back just enough to go through a massive gap between bat and pad. Sends the off stump for a walk. Magnificent start for SA."
4,"Abbott to Smith, no run full outside off, 136 kph. Lovely length, inviting some swing. Gets just enough away swing. Respectfully left"
5,"Abbott to Smith, no run brings it back again. Moving the ball both ways. Drags the length back a tad, Smith misses his flick and is struck high on the back leg."
6,"Abbott to Smith, no run beautiful over. Lovely channels. Back of a length outside off, Smith goes back and gets his head over the ball to say that's enough for now."
7,"Pretorius to Warner, 1 run wonderful batting from Warner. Rather full outside off, Warner checks his drive towards mid-off. Sees an opportunity for run and gets to the other end. A real classy single, something he has developed a lot since his finger injury"
8,"Pretorius to Smith, no run 136 kph, these are good lengths, full again. Not a lot of swing and so Smith can easily block to mid-on"
9,"Pretorius to Smith, 1 run too straight this time, Smith walks across and tucks this down to fine leg. Out if he missed but he rarely misses"
10,"Pretorius to Warner, FOUR runs awesome stuff. Not a bad delivery at all. Back of a length on middle and off. He just backs away a touch to make some room and angle his bat to get the ball through extra cover. Just a punch for four."
11,"Pretorius to Warner, no run brings this straighter, middle and leg on the same length. Worked to midwicket"
12,"Pretorius to Warner, 1 run a bit of a leading edge. 136 kph, down leg, gets a run to deep square"
13,"Abbott to Warner, OUT one more. Abbott has another. What a jaffa. Australia's openers have been bowled in 13 balls. Continues to be full on off and middle, but this tails back exaggeratedly. Goes through a gap between bat and pad again, and disturbs the stumps. Warner visibly late in picking the movement. Superb start from Abbott."
14,"Abbott to Bailey, no run full again, on middle and leg. 130.6 kph, not very pacey but naggingly accurate. Blocked"
15,"Abbott to Bailey, no run good length on off, high 120s. Comes back in, keeps low too. Defended"
16,"Abbott to Bailey, no run 128.5 kph, full and straight, some nip back. Bailey blocks"
17,"Abbott to Bailey, 1 run 131 kph, good length outside off. A thick outside edge gets Bailey one down to third man"
18,"Abbott to Smith, 2 runs too straight to Smith. A good ball to most others. Back of a length on off or just outside. Smith shuffles across and flicks in the gap at midwicket for a couple"
19,"Pretorius to Bailey, no run full on off, pushed to mid-off. Not much movement for Pretorius"
20,"Pretorius to Bailey, OUT Bailey gone now. Australia in all sorts. Bailey doesn't review, and rightly so. Plumb in front. Good length on off and middle. Bailey sees the length and stays back, but should have come forward because of the variable bounce. It keeps low, jags back in and pins Bailey plumb in front. Didn't have much chance once he hung on that back foot"
21,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 128 kph, back of a length outside off, blocked."
22,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 126 kph, full and straight. Marsh's feet stuck in the crease, defended"
23,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 131 kph, good length and straight. Defended to mid-on"
24,"Pretorius to Marsh, FOUR runs poor ball. Drifts down leg and Marsh puts it away. A neat flick through square leg gets Marsh four"
25,"Abbott to Smith, no run back of a length on off, Smith shuffles across again and works to square leg. Got to watch for that late inswinger"
26,"Abbott to Smith, no run 125 kph, the pace getting slower but the accuracy unerring. Full, straight and blocked to mid-on"
27,"Abbott to Smith, no run lovely bowling, attacking Smith's pads and you won't hear that too often. Full on middle, the ball comes back. Smothered to short midwicket"
28,"Abbott to Smith, 1 run good length on off, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
29,"Abbott to Marsh, no run 129 kph, back of a length outside off, may have moved away just a tad. Blocked to cover"
30,"Abbott to Marsh, no run beautiful shot. Overly full on off, a rare half volley. The full face of the bat offered by Marsh, straight back to Abbott who parries the ball to mid-on. Saved four in his follow-through"
31,"Pretorius to Smith, no run nice lines. Fuller than a good length outside off, pushed towards mid-off. Head over the ball"
32,"Pretorius to Smith, 1 run 131 kph, rather full again on middle and leg, a neat drive to mid-on, who is slightly deep."
33,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run good length outside off, keeping it there. Left. No slips now."
34,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 134 kph, fullish down leg, driven to mid-on"
35,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run very tight stuff from Pretorius. Nothing loose. Full and straight again, a checked muscular drive finds mid-on"
36,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 132 kph, outside off and full. Defended. Just one off"
37,"Abbott to Smith, no run more signs of the slowness of the surface. Good length outside off, Smith tries to punch a drive through the covers but skews it to midwicket instead."
38,"Abbott to Smith, no run 131 kph, nice line outside off. Smith awkwardly pushes to mid-off. Seemed a premeditated front-foot movement"
39,"Abbott to Smith, no run extra bounce this time. Good length outside off, Smith shuffles across, looks to defend but some bounce takes the shoulder of Smith's bat. Wry smiles from both batsman and bowler"
40,"Abbott to Smith, 1 run 132 kph, nice lines to Smith: his off-stump channel which is slightly wide outside off. A thick outside edge to third man"
41,"Abbott to Marsh, 1 run good length on middle, 135 kph. thick inside edge down to fine leg"
42,"Abbott to Smith, FOUR runs shot. To be fair to Abbott, it wasn't short enough to pull. But Smith had had enough of plodding about. Good length on off, he picks the length early and nails his cross-batted swat over square leg. No bother in trying to keep that down"
43,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run dead straight. Full on middle, a neat straight drive hits the stumps at the other end"
44,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run back of a length on middle, sits up for Marsh as he goes back and defends with his head right over the ball"
45,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run pushed towards mid-on with the full face"
46,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 131 kph, probably the first ball today that has gone to point, an indication of how accurate these opening bowlers have been. Good length outside off, cut to point"
47,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run rather full this time, sweetly-timed drive to a short mid-off. Amla dives, fields and elicits raucous wonder from the crowd"
48,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run back of a length outside off, pushed towards cover from the back foot. Another tight over. Lovely start"
49,"Abbott to Smith, FOUR runs oh yes. Shot of the day. Aided and abetted by a filthy half-volley. Smith comes forward and creams his cover drive. Perfect"
50,"Abbott to Smith, no run immediately drags his length slightly back. Not over adjusted, just a tad. Full outside off, and defended"
51,"Abbott to Smith, 1 run good length outside off, steered to third man with an angled face"
52,"Abbott to Marsh, no run 129 kph, fuller length outside off. Jammed into the off side"
53,"Abbott to Marsh, no run good length outside off, left alone by Marsh. Continuing those lines outside off"
54,"Abbott to Marsh, no run 125 kph, a nice fluid drive to cover from marsh. These two starting to open up"
55,"Pretorius to Smith, no run superb. Full on a fifth-stump line, which is the perfect channel to Smith. Defended"
56,"Pretorius to Smith, no run 135 kph, keeps a tad low again. Fullish on off, squeezed away to midwicket from the crease. Can't be tentative in footwork on this surface"
57,"Pretorius to Smith, 1 run back of a length outside off, Smith goes across and nudges one to midwicket. Not a bad ball"
58,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run slower offcutter on middle. Makes sure it's straight so if it goes wrong, it has to be a very good shot to get a boundary. it isn't wrong and so Marsh defends"
59,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run 132 kph outside off, drive to short mid-off. Marsh looks to hit that on the up but again mis-times it"
60,"Pretorius to Marsh, no run back of a length on middle, blocked."
61,"Shamsi to Smith, no run a lot of flight on middle, driven back to the bowler"
62,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 run too much flight this time, 101 kph. Overpitched and Smith creams his on-drive to long-on"
63,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run nice, 81 kph. Drags the length back, slightly shorter. Draws Marsh forward who somehow keeps it out"
64,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run he'll be happy to get off strike. Absolutely struggled to SL's Lakshan Sanadakan in the Tests did Marsh. Drives this to mid-off"
65,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 run this man didn't though. Reads the wrong un and pushes to long-off. Superb player of spin"
66,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run good variation but too short. Another googly, Marsh goes deep, may have read it off the pitch and punched to cover"
67,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, no run loosener to start, floats this one full at 135 kph. Smith defends"
68,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, no run 132 kph, full on off, nice drive back to the bowler. Full face of the bat. That movement from earlier has ceased"
69,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, 1 run good length on off, Smith shuffles across and works to backward square. Wants two but deep square leg is quick on it"
70,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 wide wanted to test the middle of the pitch, the first we have seen today. Bouncer down leg, tennis-ball bounce, loops over the batsman's head"
71,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run nice drive. Rather full outside off, driven on the up to deep cover"
72,"Phehlukwayo to Smith, 1 run dhort delivery on off, sits up for Smith to swat to deep square leg. Rolled his wrists to keep it down"
73,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run good length outside off, 135 kph. Pushed to point from the back foot"
74,"Shamsi to Smith, no run flat down leg, 80 kph. Misses his flick does Smith and gets rapped on the pad. Throws his head back in disgust"
75,"Shamsi to Smith, 1 run flatter, quicker, shorter on off. Smith remains calm and punches to deep cover for one"
76,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run 81 ks, quick outside off, flies off the bat to cover. Sweet drive"
77,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run persists with a quick pace. Flat outside off, pushed to cover. Angled bat, gets one"
78,"Shamsi to Smith, no run flights this one up on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
79,"Shamsi to Smith, no run 84 kph, tossed up on middle and leg, a bit of spin, not extravagant. Shovelled to midwicket"
80,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs ah yes, shot. Not a good delivery on a slow surface. A short delivery on middle and leg, sits up for Marsh to pummel through midwicket with a cross-bat swat. Put away, just what you do when you're not fluent"
81,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run back of a length on middle, Marsh hangs back and punches to mid-on"
82,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run looks to go straight over the infield. Full on off, Marsh skews to midwicket. Just not a good shot on this surface. Definitely a slower pitch"
83,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run good comeback this from AP. Keeping it tight outside off, steers to point"
84,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs short again and shot again. A bouncer that doesn't get up at all. Back of a length on off, Marsh doesn't go back, pulls through midwicket while on the front foot"
85,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run and now drifts down leg, worked to fine leg for a single"
86,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run flat on middle, slow turn. Marsh stays back and has enough time to nudge to midwicket"
87,"Shamsi to Smith, no run overpitched outside off, googly. Skewed to cover with the direction of spin"
88,"Shamsi to Smith, OUT quite close. Big appeal, but too much doubt, I'd say. Faf and his close fielders have a chat, and he decides to review. Nice flight outside off from Shamsi, it turns back in and hits Smith in front of off. This could be closer than I thought initially. No bat. Umpire's call? rRemember, there is a new lbw protocol. in force. Those new lbw rules aren't needed because it struck him in front of off and hits o"
89,"Shamsi to Head, no run ah, beauty. Flight outside off, this one spins and beats the outside edge. Hands on heads"
90,"Shamsi to Head, OUT one more! Shamsi has two in three. Another one for SA. Head has a chat with his partner and opts not to review. Australia in tatters now. Another orthodox delivery, flat on off. The ball spins a touch and beats Head's outside edge to strike him in front of off. Was there too much spin? Would it have been umpire's call? Head did not pick either delivery. Australia have been left befuddled by a few deliverie"
91,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run good length outside off, tapped to point."
92,"Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 run full and wide outside off, smashed to the sweeper cover."
93,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run good length on off, worked to midwicket"
94,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run bouncer, good change-up, well directed too. Wade gets underneath"
95,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, 1 run too straight, drifts down leg and clipped down to fine leg to get off the mark"

98,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run the wrong 'un this time outside off. Marsh hurries back and punches a drive to long-off"
99,"Shamsi to Wade, 2 runs a bit of a streaky stroke. A wristspinner will always extract extra bounce because of the additional revs imparted on the ball. As a result, that sweep stroke os fraught with risk. Top edged to backward square leg, on the bounce"
100,"Shamsi to Wade, no run darts this flat outside off, steered to point"
101,"Shamsi to Wade, 1 run flat outside off, punched to long-on. Wade almost shoulder-charges into Shamsi. Absolutely no reason for that. Left his elbow hanging out"
102,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run beautiful end. Gets this to slide past Marsh's tentative outside edge, hits him on the pad, but umpire's call oin impact with stumps. A bit of a muted appeal there"

104,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run"
105,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run lovely channels on off, 137 kph. Nothing Wade can do but block. When he has been further up, Phehlukwayo has been good"

107,"Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run good length outside off, may have taken some pace off the ball. Wade misses his cut."

109,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run tossed up outside off, driven to long-off."
110,"Shamsi to Wade, no run the googly on middle and leg, Wade reads him off the pitch and nudges to midwicket. A long hard stare from Shamsi, Wade looks away"

118,"Phangiso to Wade, FOUR runs nice stroke. Flat outside off, Wade goes back and punches this through cover. Pretorius labours after it, gets there but misses his attempt to pull the ball back. May have been surprised by the quickness of the outfield"

120,"Phangiso to Wade, no run 90 ks, quick on middle, turned away to midwicket"
121,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run another beauty. But not badly played. Played the off stump line. If the ball, turned back in, he has it covered. If it goes on, like it did, it beats the bat. Good batting."
122,"Shamsi to Marsh, no run flatter outside off, hurriedly pushed to cover"
123,"Shamsi to Marsh, 1 run another googly, but too slow, and too short. Marsh goes back and works to square leg"
124,"Shamsi to Wade, 1 run no turn, slides on to Wade's inside edge. Almost gets through. One to square leg"

133,"Phangiso to Wade, 1 run flight on off, pushed down to long-on with the spin, easy single"

Quality knock but could have done more"

He, however, looks to defend outside the line. Shami beats him on the inside and raps the front pad below the knee-roll in front of middle. The finger goes up, and Hastings knew he was gone. Din't bother to review. The tracker shows that it would take"

176,"Abbott to Zampa, OUT bowled 'em! The off stump is floored. What a sight for a fast bowler! Good-length ball angled into the right-hander. Then straightens and beats the skittish waft of Zampa. Abbott barges into Zampa's castle and takes him down. The batsman was probably aiming to run the ball through vacant slip. No dice..."

219,"Phangiso to Wade, OUT Phangiso belts out an appeal for lbw, it's given! Wade wants a review, more out of hope rather than conviction. He's also Australia's last hope. Pushed through from over the wicket, starts outside off, and spins in. Wade goes low for the sweep and misses. Struck on the thigh in line with the stumps.

Replays show pad first! Tossed up full, drifts in. Straightens enough. It would have hit middle. Australia have been dismissed for 167"
223,"SA rested three-first choice bowlers but still wiped out Australia for 167 in 36.4 overs. Abbott led the way with the new ball before Shamsi, the left-arm wristspinner, took over and ended with career-best returns of 3 for 36. The story could have been worse for the visitors if not for fifities from Wade and Marsh. We'll be back soon for the chase."
224,"12.45pm Tabraiz Shamsi: It is a good feeling, and hopefully we win this one as well. The main thing is pitching in line with the stumps and the surface does the rest. Australia is a quality side, our bowlers did a great job. We should be able to chase it down."""
225,"1pm And we're back. Qdk and Amla are out in the middle. Can Tremain find some movement with the new ball? Over the wicket, one slip"

343,"Zampa to Duminy, no run nice flight on leg, kept out"
344,"Zampa to Duminy, OUT straight to mid-off. I just despise that shot, but these guys apparently don't. Tossed up on off, Duminy tries to clear mid-off. Doesn't quite get underneath and ends up chipping his wicket away after doing all the hardwork. All he had to do was try to go straight and the margin of error increases multi-fold.

385,"Boland to Rossouw, FOUR runs width outside off, Rossouw slashes it past backward point. Not all that comfortable is the left-hander. He wrings his hands in pain. Ouch. That finger must be hurting"
