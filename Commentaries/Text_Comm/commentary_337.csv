Broad pulled a short ball, the bat rolled in his hand a touch and it looped very high, Khawaja was in off the rope, suddenly he realised that he needed to backpedal and the ball eventually dropped safe a few inches over the rope - might have one the fielder could have got his hands under, though"
249,"Harris to Swann, no run round the wicket, swings across the line and the ball rolls down the track"
250,"Harris to Swann, no run back of a length, seaming across and Swann tries a cute, late uppercut but misses"
251,"Harris to Swann, no run bumper, Swann fends at it and the manages to play it down on to the pitch"
252,"Harris to Swann, FOUR runs dug in short and again Swann climbs into it, sending the ball in a soaring arc out towards fine leg, deep square was in and won't get round in time, as it bounces to the boundary"
253,"Harris to Swann, no run swats across the line but doesn't connect"
254,"Harris to Swann, no run length on the stumps, played back in more conservative fashion"
255,"Pattinson to Broad, OUT nicked to the keeper, the partnership is ended two short of fifty! Or is it? Broad doesn't walk, naturally, and has a wee conflab with Swann before deciding to review. This looks a bit hopeful, as there was a clear deviation on the way through... Though replays show it hit the flap of the pad, too. Hot Spot picks up a faint edge, though, so any more Broad controversy is quickly put to bed. England are all out"
256,"11.55am: England's tail finally wagged, a brief spell of happy slogging to cheer the crowd after more sterling work from Ryan Harris secured his place on the honours board. As Swann and Broad showed, these are still good conditions to have a bat... but Australia have to get everything straight between their ears. Join us in ten to see how they go."
257,"Extraordinary that in this series, fifth-wicket pairs are the only ones that have been more productive than last-wicket partnerships. Here's a first-wicket pairing now, out walk Shane Watson and Chris Rogers for Australia's innings. James Anderson to begin."
258,"Anderson to Watson, no run left alone outside off"
259,"Anderson to Watson, no run Watson shapes to play at this but then brings the bat back inside"
260,"Anderson to Watson, no run lovely delivery! Oh what a cracker for Watson to have to negotiate in this first over! It's on middle and off and just curving away a fraction, Anderson puts up a huge shout for caught behind but Kumar Dharmasena says not out. Anderson wants a review, but the consensus from the England players is not to go for it, and that's a wise call. It was off the back leg, not bat"
261,"Anderson to Watson, no run Watson shoulders arms now"
262,"Anderson to Watson, no run accurate stuff from Anderson and Watson defends"
263,"Anderson to Watson, no run inswing this time and it moves late, good bowling from Anderson, but Watson is still able to leave it alone safely as it doesn't move enough to threaten his off stump"
264,"Broad to Rogers, no run good line straight away, just outside off and swinging in a touch, and Rogers defends"
265,"Broad to Rogers, no run swinging down the leg side now and Rogers tries to tickle it fine but gets nothing on it"
266,"Broad to Rogers, no run again it's curling down leg, again Rogers makes no contact"
267,"Broad to Rogers, no run outside off now and Rogers defends with a straight bat"
268,"Broad to Rogers, no run ouch, Rogers is beaten by one that nips in a fraction and bounces - it's struck him fair in the midriff"
269,"Broad to Rogers, no run squared up now and Rogers pushes to off"
270,"Anderson to Watson, no run great bowling from Anderson, fast and swinging away a fraction, from middle stump and Watson is naturally squared up. Gets a thickish edge away to off"
271,"Anderson to Watson, no run plays late this time and defends safely"
272,"Anderson to Watson, no run not so good a delivery now, angling down the leg side and Watson's attempted glance doesn't connect"
273,"Anderson to Watson, no run another thick edge from Watson, but soft hands means this doesn't carry to second slip"
274,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs first boundary for Australia now as Watson waits on a slightly shorter one and steers it off the back foot down into the ground and away behind point"
275,"Anderson to Watson, no run wider of off now and Watson slashes, he's missed it"
276,"Broad to Rogers, no run angled across Rogers, who leaves it alone"
277,"Broad to Rogers, 1 run Rogers gets off the mark now with a flick through midwicket from a ball that swings in"
278,"Broad to Watson, no run curving away outside off and Watson theatrically leaves the ball alone"
279,"Broad to Watson, no run probing outside off now but no real swing there and Watson defends solidly"
280,"Broad to Watson, no run angled in to the off stump line now and Watson defends"
281,"Broad to Watson, no run there's an appeal for lbw, it is turned down by Marais Erasmus. England appeared confident but after a conference between bowler, keeper and captain, they decide not to review and it's another wise call. That looked like it struck Watson outside the line of off, and replays confirm it."
282,"Anderson to Rogers, no run Anderson is, clearly, back on the field now, but swings this ball way down leg"
283,"Anderson to Rogers, no run strikes Rogers on the pad now but this was pitching well outside leg as Anderson is over the wicket"
284,"Anderson to Rogers, no run wrong line again from Anderson, swinging down leg and Rogers can't get anything on it"
285,"Anderson to Rogers, no run another one down leg, this one flicks the pad on the way through to Prior, who dives and collects it"
286,"Anderson to Rogers, no run on off stump now and Rogers defends to leg"
287,"Anderson to Rogers, no run defended away to the leg side again"
288,"Broad to Watson, no run Watson defends from outside off"
289,"Broad to Watson, no run a stifled shout now from Broad as Watson gets a big stride in and is hit on the pad"
290,"Broad to Watson, FOUR runs super shot from Watson now, fullish from Broad and Watson pounces with an off-drive that is more muscle than finesse, but races away to the boundary in any case"
291,"Broad to Watson, no run tries for another off drive now but straight to mid-off"
292,"Broad to Watson, no run fuller and swinging in a touch now, another stifled shout for lbw, this too was off a thick inside edge"
293,"Broad to Watson, no run left alone outside off now"
294,"Anderson to Rogers, no run Anderson sends this down at 85.3mph, it's left alone outside off,"
295,"Anderson to Rogers, no run left alone outside off again"
296,"Anderson to Rogers, 3 runs Rogers pushes this one back past Anderson, just a little jab really, but good enough to pick up three as the batsmen scamper through quickly"
297,"Anderson to Watson, no run swinging in towards off now, Watson defends with bat and pad close together"
298,"Anderson to Watson, no run Watson looks good with this drive, straight bat and firmly struck, but Pietersen at mid-on prevents any runs"
299,"Bresnan to Rogers, 2 runs fullish and outside off, just put on the spot by Bresnan, and Rogers drives past mid-off to pick up some more runs"
300,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run probing on off stump, no real swing for Bresnan, and Rogers defends"
301,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run left alone outside off"
302,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run swing this time - but swinging well away from Rogers, who leaves it alone"
303,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run on the pads and Rogers clips it to midwicket"
304,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run whippy flick to square leg to end the over"
305,"Anderson to Watson, no run Watson defends to the off side safely"
306,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs that's a classic Watson drive, he gets the big stride in and makes the ball fuller than it might otherwise have been, and he punches the drive through extra cover with power and timing"
307,"Anderson to Watson, no run solidly defended to the off side"
308,"Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson brings the length back just a touch, Watson leans forward and across to defend"
309,"Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs again Watson drives nicely through off, this time from a ball not quite so full and it's more the timing of this one than strength, he's found the gap between point and cover"
310,"Anderson to Watson, 3 runs yet more runs for Watson, this time he stands tall and off the back foot steers it behind point, it appears to be running away to the boundary but Jonny Bairstow has done magnificently in his chase and dive, flicks it back in to the field of play with his left hand - just within the bounds of play"
311,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is really on song now! No swing for Bresnan and Watson just pushes this drive through extra cover, it was in the spot but still the placement was good. Yet another boundary"
312,"Bresnan to Watson, no run straighter line and Watson defends"
313,"Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs another boundary! The runs are flowing, Bresnan gives him some more width now and Watson cuts this one away fine, well behind point, easy runs"
314,"Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs strays on to the pads this time and Watson flicks it away towards deep square leg, there is a man back there so this one doesn't add to his boundary tally"
315,"Bresnan to Watson, no run better line and length, Watson defends to off"
316,"Bresnan to Watson, no run Watson gets back to defends this straight one"
317,"Anderson to Rogers, 2 runs swings in towards the pads and Rogers just clips it along the ground out towards deep square"
318,"Anderson to Rogers, no run defended back to Anderson"
319,"Anderson to Rogers, no run better line outside off and it's defended to cover"
320,"Anderson to Rogers, no run bangs in the bouncer from around the wicket, Rogers ducks under it with a distinct lack of concern"
321,"Anderson to Rogers, no run defended away to the leg side"
322,"Anderson to Rogers, no run solid in defence again"
323,"Swann to Watson, no run turning in from outside off, Watson defends"
324,"Swann to Watson, 1 run shorter from Swann, Watson tucks it away behind square leg"
325,"Swann to Rogers, no run drifting in from around the wicket, Rogers defends"
326,"Swann to Rogers, 2 runs wristy from Rogers now as Swann drops short and angles it in to off stump, it's flicked away through midwicket"
327,"Swann to Rogers, 2 runs more flight this time and it's fuller, Rogers drives square through point. He's not finding the boundary like Watson but he's looking solid"
328,"Swann to Rogers, no run slow stuff from Swann and Rogers defends"
329,"Bresnan to Watson, no run angled in towards off, he's looking for the lbw in this over, but Watson defends"
330,"Bresnan to Watson, no run swinging in this time and Watson leaves it alone"
331,"Bresnan to Watson, no run shoulders arms again"
332,"Bresnan to Watson, OUT Bresnan strikes! He has Watson lbw in the last over before lunch! Great ball, angled in and Watson moved across with the front pad and missed the ball, he's rapped right in front and Dharmasena gives it lbw. Watson chats for a while with Rogers and eventually makes the decision to review it. It's a poor decision because that was plumb. That's not how to use the review system"
333,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run good length, pushed across and defended on the front foot outside off"
334,"Bresnan to Khawaja, 2 runs drops short, at the body, Khawaja nudges it away through square leg and they get back for a couple"
335,"Swann to Rogers, no run tapped into the off side and this very nearly results in Rogers running himself out, as Khawaja sends him back! He had to do a U-turn in the middle of the pitch as the throw came in - a direct hit would have done for him"
336,"Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and this rags hard past the outside edge as Rogers plays from the crease"
337,"Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and defended"
338,"Swann to Rogers, no run more spin as Rogers leans out, covers the line and drives to backward point"
339,"Swann to Rogers, no run full and flighted, straightening a touch outside off as Rogers leaves"
340,"Swann to Rogers, no run goes back to a wide delivery and pokes it square on the off side"
341,"Bresnan to Khawaja, 3 runs not much footwork and Khawaja fences away from his body, a thick edge flies low through the gully region, Cook gives chase and prevents four"
342,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run length ball, around off stump, steered toward point"
343,"Bresnan to Rogers, no run straighter, worked off the pads towards midwicket, no run"
344,"Bresnan to Rogers, 3 runs on the pads, touch fuller this time and Rogers neatly picks him off between midwicket and mid-on"
345,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run slightly back of a length, in the corridor, Khawaja drops back and shoulders arms"
346,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run good, probing line, on a length and drawing Khawaja forwards, he opens the face and steers to point"
347,"Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and defended into the off side"
348,"Swann to Rogers, OUT what on earth has happened here? He's missed a full toss and been hit in front ... Erasmus raises a finger and England have another, though both batsman and bowler are shaking their heads! This is like the tactic of bowling a slow full toss on Brian Lara Cricket, though there was no intent on Swann's part. The ball slipped out of the hand and Rogers was slow to sight it, missed swinging across the line and got hi"
349,"Swann to Hughes, 1 run tossed up outside off and pushed into a gap in the covers first ball"
350,"Swann to Khawaja, no run angled in with the arm and blocked"
351,"Swann to Khawaja, no run gets forward to defend in front of off"

353,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run gets forward to a length ball in the channel"
354,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run good length, Khawaja gets a stride in and blocks into the off side"
355,"Bresnan to Khawaja, no run length and in the channel outside off, steady line from Bresnan, this time Khawaja leaves"

357,"Bresnan to Khawaja, 1 run gets forward and pushes one into a gap in the covers"
358,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run pitched up a little fuller, Hughes stays in the crease and punches to mid-off"
359,"Swann to Khawaja, no run dances forward and manages to jam his gloves down on to at as the ball threatens to spins past him"
360,"Swann to Khawaja, no run angled in and defended"
361,"Swann to Khawaja, no run dropped, a dolly for Trott at first slip! Khawaja pushes at a regulation offbreak and guided it into the fielder's hands but it popped straight out of the confectionery stand and to the turf"
362,"Swann to Khawaja, no run tossed up and blocked pressing forwards"
363,"Swann to Khawaja, no run a big lbw appeal this time, bat thrust forward next to pad, hard to tell which took the impact first and might have been outside the line of off, Erasmus shakes his head"
364,"Swann to Khawaja, no run floated up and defended coming forwards"
365,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run squares him up and beats the outside edge, Hughes jumping around like a cat in his crease"
366,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run angled across and this time Hughes gets in line to defend"
367,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run pushed across the bows on a good length and left alone"
368,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run length delivery, defended around the line of off"
369,"Bresnan to Hughes, no run gets forward to defend a length ball into the covers"
370,"Bresnan to Hughes, OUT Hughes throws his hands at a wide one, very loose shot from a new batsman, there's a limp sort of appeal, particularly from Bresnan but it's immediately upheld by Dharmasena! Hughes reviews without hesitation, so he must be pretty confident he didn't hit it... So, let's see if there's evidence to overturn the decision. Hot Spot is pretty inconclusive, maybe a faint mark, there was a sound on the audio and Tony"
371,"Swann to Khawaja, no run tossed up, defended back down the track"
372,"Swann to Khawaja, no run very full, gets across to defend"
373,"Swann to Khawaja, no run bit of spin for Swann again, Khawaja pushing at it with hard hands"
374,"Swann to Khawaja, no run tossed up and defended coming forwards"
375,"Swann to Khawaja, 1 run floated up on the stumps, worked through the leg side for a single"
376,"Swann to Clarke, no run angled in with the arm, minimal turn and Clarke defends in front of off"
377,"Bresnan to Khawaja, 1 run stays back and drops into the off side, they scamper one but Bairstow swoops on it and hits one stumps from square! They go upstairs to the third umpire again, but Clarke is quick across the ground and was just in"
378,"Bresnan to Clarke, no run back of a length in the channel outside off, doesn't do much off the pitch and Clarke lets it through"

386,"Swann to Khawaja, FOUR runs back round the wicket, arm ball drifting on to the pads and Khawaja plays it well, from deep in the crease and glancing it fine for a boundary"
387,"Swann to Khawaja, no run full and flighted outside the line of off, defended"
388,"Broad to Clarke, no run gets forward to defend the ball into the off side"
389,"Broad to Clarke, no run pitched up a little in the corridor, blocked towards mid-off coming forwards"

397,"Swann to Khawaja, no run full, flighted, defended in front of off"
398,"Swann to Khawaja, OUT Khawaja on the charge, he's hit this over the top... except it doesn't go over, it merely loops high off the toe and into the hands of KP at mid-off! He hasn't looked comfortable against Swann, surviving a drop at slip and defending somewhat anxiously in front of his pad, obviously decided he didn't want to die in a hole - so he perished in no-man's land instead"

439,"Broad to Clarke, no run banged in short of a length and Clarke nudges it to point"

464,"Anderson to Agar, no run angled across Agar again, and he defends"
465,"Swann to Haddin, no run turning in to Haddin, who punches off the back foot towards cover, can't find the gap"
