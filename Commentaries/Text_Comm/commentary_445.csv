23,"Randiv to Khawaja, 1 run slower through the air, shorter too, pushed wide of point for one"
24,"Lakmal to Khawaja, no run Big shout first up. They are going for the review for the inside edge. This is short of a length, looks like it will angle across, but holds its line slightly, and Khawaja punches away from the body. There is a sound as it passes the bat, although the replays don't conclusively prove there is an inside edge onto the pad and then through to P Jayawardene. More drama. This is a bit of a farce real"

71,"Welegedara to Hussey, no run yorker, this is surely reversing here. Big shout for lbw. Umpire Dar says not out. Dilshan challenges the call. Me, I would rarely question Dar. This is full, swinging in late, pitches in front of middle, hits him in front of leg, and would have missed the leg stump, so the original decision stays. Umpire Taufel, who is doing commentary right now, immediately made out from Dar's mannerisms th"

210,"Randiv to Johnson, no run turn and bounce again, beats the outside edge as Johnson looks to defend"
211,"Randiv to Johnson, no run big appeal for a catch at the wicket. There is sharp turn and bounce, but there is also daylight between bat and pad. The shout more in hope than conviction. Can't fool Mr Dar"
212,"Randiv to Johnson, 2 runs too straight, worked into the leg side for two"
213,"Randiv to Johnson, 2 byes Where did this come from? Pitched on a length, just outside off, and explodes, chest high, and even PJ can't collect this"
214,"Randiv to Johnson, no run and he misses the edge again! This is flighted again, pitches on a length, in front of off, and with a puff of dust, kicks off. PJ does well this time to collect it"

This is short outside off, Harris doesn't offer a shot, the ball seams back in sharply, and hits him just under the knee roll, just outside off. Because he was not playing a shot, the point of impact was irrelevant. To me, it looked like it would have the the top of off. Kettleborough takes his time before"

239,"Randiv to Copeland, no run overpitched around off, defended to cover"
240,"Lakmal to Hussey, no run Lakmal is short of a length, middle and leg, Hussey is solid as ever"
241,"Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run fuller, but too straight, and he has worked it away into the leg side for one"
242,"Lakmal to Copeland, FOUR runs Copeland is hitting boundary after boundary! Short of a length, into the pads, nicely flicked away past square leg. Specialist batsmen would be proud of this"

244,"Lakmal to Copeland, no run full, outside off, driven handsomely, can't beat extra cover"

249,"Randiv to Copeland, no run drift, dip, turn, bounce, too good, because this turns back in through the bat-pad gap, misses the edge, and bounces over the stumps"
250,"Randiv to Copeland, no run overspinner, middle and off, doesn't turn, Copeland defends"
251,"Randiv to Copeland, OUT Sharp turn, simple bat-pad catch. This is flighted, draws Copeland forward, who looks to play this to leg, is not close to the pitch of the ball, gets an inside edge onto the pad, and an easy catch accrues for short leg"

257,"Lakmal to Lyon, no run Lyon is well for ward to push this length ball to point"
258,"Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs Has Welegedara pulled off a special catch? No he hasn't! This is a six! Hussey comes down the ground, chips this inside out towards long-off, Welegedara back-pedals and takes a good catch, only for his heel to step on the skirting. He claims the catch, though, but replays prove him wrong. Peter Siddle kept gesturing, asking them to stay and wait for the replays"
259,"Randiv to Hussey, no run flat delivery, Hussey deep in the crease to defend"
260,"Randiv to Hussey, no run another flat delivery, defended again"

272,"Randiv to Hussey, no run jumps out of the crease, beaten in the flight, thrusts his pad forward"
273,"Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs Hussey's gem continues! Hits a six off the fourth ball of this over. Gives him the charge again, makes room, and lofts over long-on. Enters the 90s. Ponting applauds from the balcony"
274,"Randiv to Hussey, 1 run and Hussey reverse-paddles this to take the single. He is clearly out-thinking Sri Lanka here"
275,"Randiv to Lyon, no run tossed up outside off, left alone, turns back a long way, but not enough"
276,"Dilshan to Hussey, 2 leg byes sharp offbreak, pitches middle and off, beats the sweep, hits the pad, but would never had hit the stumps. Hussey takes two leg-byes"
277,"Dilshan to Hussey, FOUR runs and in the meantime, Hussey keeps going on. This is too straight and too full, Hussey sweeps this fine, beats long leg, is now one shot away from a hundred"
278,"Dilshan to Hussey, no run long hop, pulled away, turns down the single"
279,"Dilshan to Hussey, OUT Given leg-before! Again it's the straighter ball from an offspinner that has done the damage here. This pitched outside off, Hussey defended, playing for the spin, the ball went on with the arm, hit the pad, right in front of off. Kettleborough took his time, then raised the finger. Hussey reviewed it just in case. Replays say there is no just in case here"
280,"Nevertheless a superb innings from Hussey. The Sri Lankans congratulte him as he walks off. Michael Clarke applauds from the balcony. Despite Hussey's superb 95, though, Sri Lanka will be pleased to have restricted Australia to 273 after losing the toss. They will have one over to bat today. Generally, though, they wouldn't want to bat last on this wicket. Which means they will want a huge first-innings lead"
281,The umpires think the light has gone bad enough to make the Sri Lanka batsmen head off without having to face what could have been a testing over. That will be it from us for today. This is Sidharth Monga signing off on behalf of Cricinfo. Join us tomorrow for the second day's action
282,"Harris to Sangakkara, no run Harris bangs the ball in, couldn't me more different than Copeland who 'releases' it, left alone as it bounces outside off from back of a length"

299,"Harris to Sangakkara, no run fuller delivery produces the edge, not driving length, not short too, he is caught on the crease as it zips across from around leg, but the thick edge carries along the ground towards backward point"
300,"Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run Copeland goes full outside off stump, gets it to zip after pitching close to off, he gets forward with a bit of an open face to run it away, but it goes towards gully"

325,"Copeland to Sangakkara, no run another good leave from Sanga, Copeland persevering outside off at 124.1 kph, won't bother many with that pace though, but it's that line, much like Praveen Kumar for India, who also gets a lot of swing"

Australia doing everything right, seamers not giving anything away in terms of width or driving length, spinner coming in superbly on a helpful pitch, and allrounder proving his value with deadly reverse swing. Fielding backing up"
