242,"Finn to Johnson, OUT gone! Finn gets the breakthrough with another shortish one tempting Johnson to pull, but his shot flies straight to Anderson at square leg, where he takes a simple catch."
243,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run wide of off, Hilfenhaus leaves it"
244,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run good line, tempting Hilfenhaus just outside off and he dabs, not connecting bat on ball"
245,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run good bounce and carry, Hilfenhaus leaves it"
246,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run pushed away to point"
247,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run angled in to Siddle, who clips it to leg"
248,"Tremlett to Siddle, 2 runs trying to york Siddle now, but he flicks it nicely through square leg and it's good, hard running to get back for two"
249,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run this one really nips in off the seam, striking Siddle on the pad and would have gone down leg"
250,"Tremlett to Siddle, no run good bouncer, well directed, but Siddle is good enough to duck it"
251,"Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run Siddle dabs to cover and takes off for a single, so he'll keep the strike"
252,"Finn to Siddle, no run another very good bouncer, and another good piece of ducking from Siddle, getting safely out of the way"
253,"Finn to Siddle, 1 run good drive from Siddle, and he's unlucky to just get the single there as it's well fielded at short cover, knocked down by Trott"
254,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs Hilfenhaus goes for the cut and it comes off beautifully! Right through the gap between point and gully"
255,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, 1 run edged and is that a dropped chance? No, it's bounced just short of Swann at second slip, and in knocking it down he allows Hilfenhaus to get a single"
256,"Finn to Siddle, 1 run clipped away off the hips for a run to fine leg"
257,"Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run angled bat from Hilfenhaus, and it's collected at gully"
258,"Tremlett to Siddle, FOUR runs edged and that just gets up high enough to fly over the head of Swann, jumping up at second slip - that ball really lifted sharply off the pitch"
259,"Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run bouncer and this time Siddle doesn't duck, he hooks and gets a single to deep backward square"
260,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run good ball, banged in short of a length on off stump but Hilfenhaus waves the bat inside it"
261,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs thumped! That's what Hilfenhaus has developed - the ability to hit good bowlers for four! He's flat batted that over mid off, nicely done indeed"
262,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs and with short leg in, the bouncer was on, so Hilfenhaus winds up and throws the kitchen sink at that hook, finding the gap at deep square leg! Entertaining stuff!"
263,"Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run yorker, and Hilfenhaus defends - almost wanting a single so he can keep the strike!"
264,"Finn to Siddle, FOUR runs another boundary! This time it's Siddle launching that one back down the ground, a really good uppish drive through the mid-off area"
265,"Finn to Siddle, no run nudged away to the leg side"
266,"Finn to Siddle, FOUR runs another boundary! This one is, er, I think the best way to describe that is a slap. Short ball, and he's pulled it, of sorts, but forward of midwicket, not exactly in control but effective!"
267,"Finn to Siddle, no run bouncer! Siddle tries for the hook, though not really watching the ball, and it goes through to Prior, who doesn't take it cleanly"
268,"Finn to Siddle, 2 runs Siddle backs away now and somehow gets that off the toe of the bat through mid-off, not exactly where he wanted it to go, but gets a couple"
269,"Finn to Siddle, 1 run cleverly done by Siddle, he's pushed back onto the back foot by a short-of-a-length ball and prods it in the air to off, but then takes off for a run as he realises the fielders are a little deep"
270,"Swann to Siddle, no run leans forward to defend, watchfully"
271,"Swann to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, again Siddle is more careful against the spinner and just defends"

273,"Swann to Siddle, 1 run edgy, but safely through point for a single"
274,"Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run turning down leg, it's clipped to short midwicket"
275,"Swann to Hilfenhaus, OUT ah, there's the last wicket as Hilfenhaus gets an inside edge onto the thigh and it's taken by Cook at short leg"
276,"""Swann strikes in the first over of his spell. Order restored in every sense,"" notes Andrew Miller."
277,"Australia have managed to get their total up to 268, which is well below par but given their horrid start, isn't too bad a finish. And if their fast bowlers can get a few early wickets, who knows what could happen. But good luck"
278,"It may not be long before we see Mitchell Johnson for the first time in his return. For now, it's Peter Siddle to take the ball from Ben Hilfenhaus."
279,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run Hilfenhaus gets some more inswing, but it's wide enough of off to be left alone without incident"

289,"Harris to Strauss, no run shorter, and it's quick at 139kph, Strauss ducks it"
290,"Harris to Strauss, no run down leg side again, Strauss tries to glance but can't connect"
291,"Siddle to Cook, no run horrid start from Siddle, almost as if he's held that ball the wrong way around! It's swung waaaay down leg, and Haddin does tremendously to dive across and stop that with his right hand"
292,"Siddle to Cook, no run again it's swinging in, but again it's the wrong line, down leg side again"
293,"Siddle to Cook, no run oh, good ball! Cook is drawn forward and prods just outside off, it beats the outside edge"
294,"Siddle to Cook, no run ooh, a brave leave from Cook as this one swings in and sails just over the off stump"
295,"Siddle to Cook, no run probing outside off with another that swings in, Cook leaves it"
296,"Siddle to Cook, no run banged in a touch shorter of a length, Cook leaves it alone"
297,"Johnson to Strauss, no run outside off stump to start with at 134kph, Strauss leaves it"
298,"Johnson to Strauss, no run there's some swing away from Strauss, which isn't Johnson's natural swing - but it was much too wide of off"

300,"Johnson to Strauss, no run straighter ball now and Strauss gets it to square leg"
301,"Johnson to Strauss, no run bouncer, and it's quick at 139kph, but Strauss ducks it easily"
302,"Johnson to Strauss, FOUR runs cut hard and just wide of gully! That was hit uppishly but timed well, and Hussey at gully wasn't ever going to catch that, a very good shot, if a tad more aerial than Strauss intended"
303,"Siddle to Cook, 2 runs well played by Cook, he punches this off the back foot behind point and gets a couple"
304,"Siddle to Cook, no run banged in short of a length, Cook works it to leg"
305,"Siddle to Cook, 1 run good yorker, swinging in a touch but in this form Cook is good enough to clip that away behind square leg"
306,"Siddle to Strauss, no run that's a pretty good bouncer, well directed and Strauss squats under it"
307,"Siddle to Strauss, no run Strauss goes for the cover drive now, but can't beat the diving man in the infield"
308,"Siddle to Strauss, 1 run attacking the straight line now, Strauss defends to leg and manages to get a single"
309,"Johnson to Strauss, no run fullish and angling in to the off stump of Strauss, who pushes to mid on"
310,"Johnson to Strauss, no run left alone just outside off"
311,"Johnson to Strauss, no run too short and too wide of off, Strauss is not interested"
312,"Johnson to Strauss, no run good carry through to Haddin as Johnson probes outside off at 141kph, Strauss leaves it"
313,"Johnson to Strauss, no run good delivery, fullish and straight, a hint of swing again but Strauss is good enough to work that to midwicket"
314,"Johnson to Strauss, no run again he attacks the stumps and again Strauss defends, Johnson is looking pumped up and confident but can't get a wicket in his short spell"
315,"Harris to Cook, no run on off stump, defended carefully towards backward point"
316,"Harris to Cook, no run outside off, only carries through at knee height as Harris loosens up"
317,"Harris to Cook, no run that's a good one outside off, more carry this time and Cook probably played at that although he tried to draw the bat inside the line"
318,"Harris to Cook, no run back of a length, Cook stands tall in the crease and pushes into the covers"
319,"Harris to Cook, no run full outside off, Cook comes half forward and drives without any timing towards mid-on"
320,"Harris to Cook, no run a strangled shout from Harris, this takes Cook high on the pads and was nowhere near an lbw"
321,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run ooh, good start, extra bounce on off stump and Strauss has to defend awkwardly as he's taken by surprise"
322,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 2 runs waits nicely for this and turns it off the body out towards deep square-leg and they hustle back for a second"
323,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 2 runs swings into the pads and Strauss plays neatly with the movement as he whips it past square-leg...long leg comes around to tidy up"
324,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run gee, that was close to off stump as Strauss shoulders arms to one just outside off...heart-in-mouth for a few moments for the England captain"
325,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run a little wider outside off, shapes back to the left hander but it's a more comfortable leave this time"
326,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run on off stump, Strauss gets right behind the line and defends to the on side"
327,"Harris to Cook, 3 runs well played by Cook, full outside off and he leans into a cover drive which finds the gap at cover...not quite the legs to reach the boundary, but a pleasing start for him"
328,"Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs dropped on my goodness, they've missed another. Back of a length, Strauss pushes hard and the edge flies between keeper and first slip but neither Haddin or Watson even went for the chance. Wh"

341,"Harris to Strauss, no run back of a length, not quite so short and this time Strauss defends off the back foot"
342,"Harris to Strauss, no run defended from middle and off into midwicket, plenty of time for Strauss to wait on the back foot...the edge came from a ball a touch fuller"
343,"Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs another short one, this sits up and gives Strauss oodles of time to pull this off the front foot forward of square...deep square can't get around. That was a bit of a long hop"
344,"Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs full on the pads this time, and Strauss tucks it away along the ground through midwicket with ease to bring up the 50 stand...brisk progress from England, poor bowling from Harris"

349,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run full outside off, too wide to tempt Strauss into having a drive"
350,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 1 run tucked from middle and off into the gap at midwicket...good rotation between these two"
351,"Johnson to Strauss, no run starts full on middle and Strauss punches it to mid-on"
352,"Johnson to Strauss, no run very full on middle again, Strauss digs it out back to the bowler"
353,"Johnson to Strauss, no run on off stump, Strauss is firmly behind it and pushes up to mid-off...good line from Johnson"
354,"Johnson to Strauss, no run his first bouncer of the day, it's very short and flies comfortably over Strauss's head as he ducks underneath"
355,"Johnson to Strauss, FOUR runs oh, that's a lovely shot, a classic on-drive from off stump and the ball races down the ground. A sign of a batsman in form"

357,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run outside off and swings back again at Strauss as he leaves alone"
358,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 1 run touch too straight, worked off the pads down to long leg"
359,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run full outside off, squeezed out towards gully where Mike Hussey makes a good save to support his bowler"
360,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run that's a good one from Hilfenhaus, after all the inswingers this one goes the other way and beats the outside edge by quite a distance"
361,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, FOUR runs drags it down a little shot, allows Cook to bring out his favourite cut shot for the first time today and it whistles to the point boundary...that wasn't a shocking ball, very well played"
362,"Hilfenhaus to Cook, 1 run good response, jags back on off stump and cramps Cook for room but he's able to get it away behind square"

364,"Johnson to Cook, 1 run goes straighter this time and it's neatly worked away into midwicket"
365,"Johnson to Strauss, no run nearly a mix-up as Strauss pushes firmly into the covers and calls for a single, but then decides it not on and Cook has to hurry to get back and beat Michael Clarke's throw"
366,"Johnson to Strauss, 2 runs on leg stump and worked away through square leg, this time there's good running to make it into a couple"
367,"Johnson to Strauss, no run full outside off with a hint of shape away from Strauss as he leaves"
368,"Johnson to Strauss, 1 run pushed outside leg stump and it's flicked away down to long leg...not a good delivery"

375,"Johnson to Cook, no run on off stump, Cook waits on the back foot and defends to mid-off"
376,"Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs short and wide, it came off the top edge but flew well over the slips down to third man...Cook didn't try to keep that down, although it went finer than he wanted"

381,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run pushed wide outside off and left alone...that will have to the line with this field"
382,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run just like that! It's a ripper which zings back at Strauss from short of a length and he has to be quick to get his gloves out of the way"
383,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run fuller this time and a much easier leave"
384,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"

386,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, (no ball) outside off again, another leave and Hilfenhaus has overstepped this time"

402,"Johnson to Trott, OUT gone! Johnson strikes again. Full on off stump, hint of swing back into the right hander and that's plumb. Trott driving and is beaten by the movement, superb stuff from Mitchell."

404,"Johnson to Pietersen, no run good line, just straightening down the off stump and Pietersen defends"

409,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run sharp bouncer, but Strauss ducks it comfortably"

411,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 2 runs a little too straight and there's not enough cover on the leg side, so Strauss picks up runs through midwicket"
412,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run good line outside off stump, this one doesn't swing and Collingwood defends"

422,"Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 run shorter and swinging away, Collingwood punches this one through cover"
423,"Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run bouncer! That's fast and swinging as it goes over the batsman's head, Haddin jumps and can't reach it and Watson at first slip leaps up and stops that one, tapping the ball up like a volleyba"

425,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood tries to pull one of the hips, can't connect"
426,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run banged in at the hips, it's nudged away through square leg"
427,"Johnson to Strauss, no run terrific ball, and well played! That's an outswinging yorker - starting at leg stump and straightening, right on line and Strauss does well to keep that out"

433,"Harris to Bell, no run good probing line just outside off, Bell defends solidly"

437,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run pushed away to point"
438,"Johnson to PD Collingwood, OUT another lbw shout as this one swings in, but it's given not out. Ponting asks for a review, but that looked high and off-side. But wait, the replays show that shape was enough to straighten"

465,"Siddle to Prior, 4 byes d'oh! Wrong line entirely from Siddle as he sprays one down leg, Haddin has no chance of stopping this and it's been called byes"
466,"Harris to Bell, 1 wide huge swing, and terribly wide of off, Haddin does well to dive in front of Watson at first slip and take it, but that's clearly a wide"

468,"Harris to Bell, no run better line now outside off stump and it's defended safely back down the pitch"
469,"Harris to Bell, 3 runs Harris draws Bell into a drive and it's a thick edge that runs away through point, not where Bell intended that ball to go"
470,"Harris to Prior, 1 run ooh, Prior again miscues a pull and this one lobs safely just wide of midwicket, Prior was surprised by the speed of it and wasn't watching the ball when he connected with it in front of his eyes"
471,"Harris to Bell, no run down leg side and Haddin takes another leaping catch, but this was off the pad only"
472,"Harris to Bell, no run good line outside off, and it's left alone"
473,"Siddle to Prior, no run starts full outside off, forced out into the off side"
474,"Siddle to Prior, 1 run good yorker, Siddle trying for a repeat of how he did Prior at the Gabba, but's squeezed out through gully who will probably feel he should have cut it off"
475,"Siddle to Bell, 3 runs lovely from Bell, boy he looks in good form, as he drives a delivery from off stump elegantly through the covers but mid-off manages to haul it in"
476,"Siddle to Prior, no run good length on off stump, defended into the off side"
477,"Siddle to Prior, no run well, what happened there? Looks like Prior lost that ball and almost lost his off stump too as he failed to pick up a low full toss which just misses the timber as Prior flays late at the ball"
478,"Siddle to Prior, no run back outside off and left alone"
479,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run starts with a bouncer, Bell goes for the pull but doesn't make contact although there's an appeal from Haddin. Nothing from the bowler"
480,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run wide outside off and swinging away further, left alone"
481,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run short of a length outside off, still getting nice shape away from the batsman"
482,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, 3 runs another sweet drive from Bell as he leans on this outside off stump and finds the gap at cover"

487,"Siddle to Bell, no run good line on off stump, keeping Bell in defensive mode"

493,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run defended back towards the bowler who collects in his follow through"
494,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, 1 run steps across his crease and flicks this down to long leg, was in the air for a while but well clear of square leg"
495,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run probing away on off stump, Prior plays back and defends"
496,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs brings out the pull again, and again doesn't connect very well as it loops into the gap at midwicket...Prior hasn't got his timing, yet, and has been troubled by the short ball"
497,"Siddle to Bell, no run fired down the leg side, Haddin makes a fine take as he takes off to his left"
498,"Siddle to Bell, no run on off stump and defended towards the on side"
499,"Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs he's creamed that, shows Prior how to play the pull with a crunching shot that races to the boundary. He picked it up very early and took it from an off-stump line"
500,"Siddle to Bell, no run much fuller on off stump, hint of movement into Bell as he drives to mid-on"

503,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run outside off, left alone with the swing"

506,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs waits for this to swing and opens the face through backward point"
507,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run a very short bounce which goes miles over Prior's head...not far from a wide. Umpires have been strict on them in this series"
508,"Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run that's a better bouncer, makes Prior jerk his head back out of the line"
509,"Siddle to Bell, 1 run well played, rides the bounce nicely by taking his bottom hand off the bat and work it through leg gully"
510,"Siddle to Prior, no run a bouncer well outside leg stump and Prior barely has to move to avoid it"
511,"Siddle to Prior, no run down the leg side again, but not too far from Prior's gloves as he has a little waft"
512,"Siddle to Prior, no run short over leg stump and Prior jumps inside the line...hello Bodyline?"
513,"Siddle to Prior, no run stays short and over leg stump so Prior moves inside the line again...at least he's sticking to a plan"

519,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run keeps it outside off, trying to build some pressure, and left alone"
520,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run and...wait for it...another leave"

522,"Siddle to Prior, no run another short one, this makes Prior play as he defends off the back foot from about leg stump"
523,"Siddle to Prior, no run that's a good short ball, clangs Prior on the shoulder as he ducks into the line"
524,"Siddle to Prior, OUT gone! Well, the short ball has worked in the end but probably not quite as they expected. The ball after getting hit, Prior moves across his stumps to work it away, but it deflects off his body, back"
525,"Siddle to Swann, no run very short to start with, not surprising, and Swann ducks underneath"
526,"Siddle to Swann, no run another short one outside off, Swann drops his hands and lets it go through."
527,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run behind the line and defends"
528,"Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run outside off and left alone as it swings away"

536,"Siddle to Bell, 1 run full on off stump, pushed back past the bowler and mid-on is very wide"
537,"Siddle to Swann, no run a decent short ball this time and Swann turns his head as he sinks onto his knees"
538,"Siddle to Swann, 1 run targeting the body again, flicked away off his hip through square leg...Swann slips so it means they can't make the second"
539,"Siddle to Bell, no run jumps back in his crease and defends by taking the bottom hand off the bat"
540,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run ah, now that's a good short one, well directed over off stump and it's close to Swann's gloves as he drops his hands. Short balls don't have to start very short here, if you know what I mean"

552,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run short of a length, shaping away past Swann's bat"
553,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs crutched...Swann brings out a powerful back-foot drive through the covers as he's offered a hint of width. Put it away well"
554,"Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run good response from Hilfenhaus, tighter to off stump and I think Swann just about drew his bat away"

560,"Johnson to Bell, no run again this one doesn't really swing, just probing outside off and Bell leaves it alone"
561,"Johnson to Bell, no run super delivery! That's a cracker, swinging in and comprehensively beating Bell, who was late getting the bat down on that, which may have saved him from edging it"

584,"Johnson to Swann, no run leading edge this time as Swann plays a straight ball, looking to work it to leg"
585,"Johnson to Swann, no run Swann swings hard, looking for a cover drive but this one beats the bat"
