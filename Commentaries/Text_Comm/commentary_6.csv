5,"Starc to Hope, 3 runs full on fourth stump at 142 kph, punched on the up back down the ground again and Wade chases from mid-off to corral it before the rope for three."

16,"Starc to Hope, no run full on the stumps, defended to mid-on."
17,"Starc to Hope, 2 runs overpitched on sixth stump, driven firmly through the covers but more off the toe of the bat than the middle and it slows up before the rope."
18,"Starc to Hope, no run Starc drags this wider on the guideline at 145 kph on a full length, Hope leaves it believing it might be called a wide but the umpire lets it go."
19,"Starc to Hope, no run back of a length on seventh stump at 145 kph, left alone again."
20,"Hazlewood to Lewis, no run back of a length on fourth stump at 134 kph, defended."
21,"Hazlewood to Lewis, no run short on the body, goes to pull and a deflection goes down the leg side to Carey. Big appeal given not out. Live it looked like it came off the glove. It slowed up as it passed Lewis. Carey calls for the DRS review. In fact the ball has come off the thigh guard. Umpire Leslie Reifer Jr's not out decision is vindicated. Australia lose a review."

44,"Hazlewood to Hope, 1 run full on off stump at 139 kph, punched back past the non-striker to mid-on for one."
45,"Hazlewood to Hetmyer, OUT Hazlewood strikes to remove another batsman with this around the wicket angle back of a length. Hazlewood bangs this in on a fifth stump line, enough width to tempt Hetmyer into a back foot punch but there's a touch of variable bounce and it disrupts Hetmyer enough to produce an inside edge dragging onto the stumps. Hetmyer shapes like he wanted to swing his bat and destroy the stumps in frustration before opting to walk off"

76,"Agar to Hope, OUT flight from Agar produces the edge to backward point! Agar kept on flighting these deliveries on fourth stump on a fullish length that Hope habitually groped at and this is yet another one where Hope pushes much too far in front of his body not really trying to score. The hard-handed shot balloons in the air between short third man and backward point but it is Marsh at backward point who charges forward and dives to pluck this inche"

86,"Turner to Pooran, OUT my goodness! Bowled without offering a shot in a limited overs match?!?! Turner has been slanting every ball in from very wide of the crease and getting decent turn to most deliveries. Pooran strides forward to this ball that pitches on fifth stump on a good length and shoulders arms expecting it to straighten safely wide of off stump but it skids on as an arm ball and pings back off stump. It clips the very top of off to kick o"

251,"Zampa to Lewis, 1 run good length ball on middle, goes back to flick through the leg side."
252,"Zampa to Hosein, OUT googly looks like it's cleaned up Hosein with a stumping. Flighted beautifully on fourth stump to suck him forward trying to flick through midwicket but it spins past the shot and his back leg overstretches on the shot. Carey is razor sharp whipping the bails off with his toe still in the air trying to get back into his ground. Wonderfully set up and cleverly executed."
253,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run Cottrell prods awkwardly away from his body at a full ball on sixth stump, inside edge ricochets into his feet. Lucky not to drag onto the stumps."
254,"Starc to Lewis, no run bounces Lewis on fourth stump, tries to muscle a pull over square leg and turns down a single."
255,"Starc to Lewis, no run yorker speared into leg stump at 142 kph, Lewis late on a flick. Big lbw shout from Starc denied. It was missing leg but Australia can't review regardless."

261,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run good length ball on fourth stump, shuffles across to get in line to defend."
262,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run googly pitches full on fourth stump, a wild heave over midwicket misses and luckily for Cottrell so does the ball going past leg stump. Shades of Shannon Gabriel in the Test ending v Pakistan a few years back."
263,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run good length ball defended again."
264,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run good length ball on fifth stump, defended."
265,"Zampa to Cottrell, no run darts this in full outside leg stump, Cottrell flicks across and misses as it thuds off his boot. Maiden."

275,"Zampa to Cottrell, 1 leg bye zips this in flat and quick outside leg stump, misses a flick but it deflects off the thigh wide of Carey through fine leg to allow Lewis to get back on strike."
276,"Zampa to Lewis, no run googly lands short on fourth stump, rocks back to slap this to extra cover."
277,"Zampa to Lewis, SIX runs meatball of a full toss on middle stump at thigh height, Lewis devours it in one bite chomping this high over the rope at wide long-on to bring up his 10th half-century in ODIs."
278,"Starc to Cottrell, OUT Starc was searching for a yorker but spears in a full toss at knee height on off stump at 142 kph. In truth it was a poor delivery but Cottrell shows what a tailender he is with an even worse attempt to stab it out. Flails at this while hopping away from the stumps and off stump is ripped out of the ground. The ball makes contact with the turf only after clanging into the timber."
279,Australia's batting lineup may have their hands full with Hosein and Walsh Jr on another pitch offering plenty of assistance to the bowlers but the visitors should still be heavy favorites to chase this down and claim another 10 points on the World Cup Super League points table. Stay with us for the start of the chase in due time.
280,5.55 pm Starc ends with 11 wickets in three matches in this ODI series. Another sharp spell from him but really Hazlewood was the bowler of the innings. 8-1-18-2 does not truly tell the story of how often he beat the edge and on another day he would've taken at least twice as many wickets. The spinners played their part as well. No weak links in the Australia attack today.
281,"Philippe and Henriques in the middle to open the chase. Henriques off strike, opening with McDermott out of the lineup. Cottrell with the new ball coming left-arm over the wicket."
282,"Cottrell to Philippe, no run good length ball on fifth stump, left alone."

294,"Holder to Philippe, no run full on off stump, pushes with hard hands and the ball floats uppishly but lands well short of mid-off."
295,"Hosein to Henriques, no run strikes first ball! Or does he!?! Hosein pitches this full on middle and leg, awkward prod forward and it looked to clearly come off an inside edge onto the pad and then straight to Pollard. Raucous appeal for a catch and Joel Wilson stands looking quizzically before consulting with Leslie Reifer Jr at square leg. After a consultation, they refer to the third umpire with a soft signal of out but the doubt is whether or not"
296,"Hosein to Henriques, OUT no reprieve for Henriques this time! His tour from hell ends in a ball of flames. Hosein darts this arm ball in at 94 kph on off stump, Henriques shuffles across to defend down the wrong line well outside the line of the ball playing for turn and is thumped below the knee roll. Hosein, Hope, Pollard, everyone within vicinity of the bat goes up in an uproarious appeal and Joel Wilson gives this out immediately. Henriques walks"
297,"Hosein to Carey, 1 run Hosein drags this down very short to Carey who gets on a knee and pulls first ball high over square leg for one."

310,"Hosein to Philippe, no run flights this again on fourth stump at 87 kph, fraction of width to entice a drive and it rips past the edge. Hope collects and whips the bails off just in case Philippe has overbalanced. His foot was in the air briefly but the footage is very very grainy. To make matters worse for West Indies they are not using Zing stumps. If they had, this would definitely be out but it's 50/50 with the traditional stumps. This looks out t"

317,"Holder to Carey, no run short and wide, goes to slap this through cover but comes off the toe of the bat to the off side ring fielder."
318,"Holder to Carey, no run back of a length on middle stump seaming away sharply, Carey fends at this and misses. Big appeal due to the sharp late movement but it was purely off the pitch and not the bat."

320,"Hosein to Carey, no run flighted full on off stump, goes to sweep and mistimes this into the pads and then caroms through square leg. Hosein appeals wildly but gets no support. Clearly deflected off the glove."

331,"Hosein to Marsh, no run full on sixth stump, Marsh goes to hammer a sweep, Pollard turns his back at forward short leg and it pings off a very fleshy part of his back in the air toward Hosein but doesn't carry for what would have been one of the all-time great bizarre dismissals."
332,"Hosein to Marsh, (no ball) flighted wider on seventh stump, Marsh can't reach a sweep this time and is beaten. But a no ball is called from the third umpire. Inexcusable for Hosein to overstep. Pollard has to exit the field from his position at forward short leg for the upcoming free hit."

357,"Walsh to Carey, no run flighted full on fifth stump, goes to sweep and misses."
358,"Walsh to Carey, no run dropped! Premeditated reverse sweep mistimed toward Joseph at short third man. He charged forward and dove forward, definitely got two hands underneath it but it clangs off his palms and bursts out. 8/10 difficulty but he got there and it was coming at a gentle pace fluttering off the mistimed shot. Had to be taken."
359,"Walsh to Carey, 1 run Full on off stump, paddle sweep behind square for one."

366,"Cottrell to Marsh, OUT bounced out! Short ball plan finally comes off! Angles a bouncer onto the legs at 133 kph, Marsh swivels to hook and he's a touch early as the ball comes off the back of the bat and feathers through to Hope whose footwork is marvelous as he takes another leg side chance standing upright rather than diving. Marsh walks rather than wait for the umpire's decision and is fuming with himself all the way to the dugout."

462,"Walsh to Wade, no run googly lands full outside leg stump, Wade goes to tickle it fine but it spins across the bat face to produce a leading edge lobbing up just short of point."
463,"Walsh to Wade, FOUR runs googly again lands short outside off, he goes back to cut in front of point and it bounces away to the rope."
464,"Walsh to Wade, no run good length ball on fifth stump, Wade premeditates a sweep and misses. No wide called as it spins down leg."
465,"Walsh to Wade, no run short on sixth stump, goes back to punch to extra cover."
466,"Walsh to Wade, no run flighted full on fourth stump, defended to backward point."
467,"Pooran to Agar, 1 run full and wide, driven to the cover sweeper."
468,"Pooran to Wade, FOUR runs dropped! Sloppy full toss from Pooran at rib height on sixth stump, Wade slaps this to extra cover and it carries at shin height to the man on the ring. Darren Bravo is half-asleep with the match one shot away from ending and reacts very late, falls to his right getting hands to it but it bursts through and goes all the way to the rope. Wade brings up his half-century off the drop."
469,"Pooran to Wade, 1 run full on off stump, pokes this with soft hands into the covers and scampers a single to beat Walsh Jr's charge, scoop and underhand flick toward the non-striker's stumps. Australia clinch a dominant six-wicket win with 19.3 overs to spare."
470,"Well, Ashton Agar said he can't wait to bowl on a pitch like this again. Kieron Pollard... not so much! His quotes will give observers inside and outside the West Indies plenty to chew on until the T20I series with Pakistan gets underway in a few days time. But this wraps up Australia's tour of the region. Thanks for tuning into our coverage. For Andrew McGlashan, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care!"
471,Not so subtle critique of the pitches in Barbados from captain Pollard!
472,"8.50 pm Australia win the series 2-1, but more importantly take 20 out of 30 World Cup Super League Qualifying points. The speed of victory tonight also gives them a hefty boost to their net run rate while the West Indies take a considerable hit in the same tiebreaker column. Wade ends unbeaten with 51, Starc took three wickets to end with best figures on the night, but if you ask me the Man of the Match should go to either Agar or Hazlewood. Agar bowled a"
