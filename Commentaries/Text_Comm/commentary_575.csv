1,"Sreesanth to Gilchrist, 2 runs strayed down leg, turned round to deep fine leg with a quick tuck off the pads"
2,"Sreesanth to Gilchrist, 1 run on the legs once again and tucked round again but this time for a single, but Sreesanth will be encouraged by the swing he is finding"
3,"Sreesanth to Hayden, FOUR runs once again that's on the legs, Sreesanth struggling to find his line to the left handers, and Hayden booted that one off the hips with a firm push through backward square"
4,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run much better line and causes Hayden some trouble there with one which pitches just outside and comes back so close to the forwrad-prodding edge"
5,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run tucked up on leg, with one which pitches on a good length, Hayden squeezes down and out towards mid-on"
6,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run swing back in to the left hander, tight line, and pushed out to mid-on without much power"
7,"Sharma to Gilchrist, FOUR runs over the wicket, short and wide and Gilchrist hits that very hard indeed, standing back and rocking a strong cut up and over backward point and it goes like lightning across the turf"
8,"Sharma to Gilchrist, 1 run better line and length, just on off, worked down off the back foot defensively rather than anything"

10,"Sharma to Hayden, no run banged wide down the channel, again a big leave"
11,"Sharma to Hayden, no run nipped across him with some zig and no little zag, a testing length and the batsman shoulders arms as it goes down the channel"
12,"Sharma to Hayden, no run more of the same, and the batsman does well to leave it, too much of a good length"
13,"Sharma to Hayden, no run there must be a deliberate plan to bowl wide down the channel because there he goes again, once more left"

15,"Sreesanth to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Gilchrist goes again, outside off, and drilled hard on the front foot through cover"
16,"Sreesanth to Gilchrist, OUT what a ripper of a delivery and a good catch - nips it hard back in fro moutside off on a shortish length, Gilchrist jumps into the line and pushes through a nick off an inside edge, Dhoni dives far to his"
17,"Sreesanth to Ponting, 3 runs outside off, Ponting bissects the fielders at mid-off and cover with a firm push of a forward defence"
18,"Sreesanth to Hayden, no run shoulders arms there as the ball jags back a touch from outside off, Hayden quick to make sure to evade the ball"
