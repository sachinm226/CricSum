Yuvraj Singh was"
316,It's Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden to open. Zaheer Khan will bowl first.
317,Hello and welcome to start of coverage of the Australian chase. I'm Anand Vasu and will be calling the second half of this match. The players are coming out onto the field and the game will resume shortly.
318,"Khan to Gilchrist, 1 wide short of a good length and far outside the off, a bit of swing away from the bat that will encourage the bowler, but the line was not good at all. Easily left alone and called a wide even more easily"
319,"Khan to Gilchrist, 1 leg bye fuller this time and a touch too straight, Zaheer overcompensating. Gilchrist gets across and tries to flick but misses. The ball goes off the pad down towards fine-leg"

321,"Khan to Hayden, no run Much better. Short of a driving length and just outside the off, a hint of swing away, left alone to the keeper"

332,"Khan to Gilchrist, 1 run just short of a good length and on the stumps, played down to the on side with a straight bat"
333,"Khan to Hayden, FOUR runs short of a driving length, outside the off, too much width here. Hayden doesn't really care if he isn't to the pitch of the ball. He hits cleanly through the line and over the infield to the cover fence"
