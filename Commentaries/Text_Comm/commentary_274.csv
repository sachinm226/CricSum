0,"Hello all, welcome to the second ODI at the Gabba. The news from the middle is that England have won the toss and will bat. They have also gone in with an unchanged side from the Melbourne ODI, despite the loss there. A win against the Prime Minister's XI might just have given them a little of the confidence that has been lacking."
1,"McKay to Cook, 1 run Cook starts with a cut, gets it away to third man for a single"
2,"McKay to Bell, no run tempting line outside off from McKay and gets some away swing, Bell lets it through to Haddin"
3,"McKay to Bell, 1 wide McKay gets this one wrong, swinging it down leg side for a very wide wide"
4,"McKay to Bell, 2 runs Bell goes for a drive outside off and this skews off a thickish outside edge behind point, he picks up a couple of runs"
5,"McKay to Bell, 1 wide plenty of swing here for McKay but again it's too much movement - this one curves too wide of off and is called a wide"
6,"McKay to Bell, no run outswing again but not quite as wide and Bell just watches this through to Haddin"
7,"McKay to Bell, no run more accurate now as McKay probes on off stump and Bell defends a short-of-a-length delivery"
8,"McKay to Bell, no run Bell comes forward now and ends up just defending this back towards McKay"
9,"Johnson to Cook, no run accurate immediately at 140kph, Cook defends this from off stump"
10,"Johnson to Cook, 1 wide and Johnson now finds what McKay has already discovered - it ain't easy controlling this swing. This one curves well wide of off and almost to first slip. Wide signalled by umpire John Ward, who is on his ODI debut"
11,"Johnson to Cook, no run beaten outside off! Lovely delivery, just moves away enough to beat the bat of Cook, who was dabbing at this"
12,"Johnson to Cook, no run outside off stump again and this one Cook leaves alone"
13,"Johnson to Cook, no run Johnson goes fuller, aiming for the yorker at 146kph, but it's not quite full enough for a yorker and Cook pushes to leg"
14,"Johnson to Cook, 2 runs Cook gets some width now and it's a touch shorter, he's happy to punch this through cover and pick up a couple more runs"
15,"Johnson to Cook, no run this one swings in just a touch and Cook defends solidly towards off"
16,"McKay to Bell, no run McKay moves this in to the right-hander Bell, who defends"
17,"McKay to Bell, no run Bell leans out to defend once more, he's making a watchful start"
18,"McKay to Bell, no run a shout from the Australians here as this one swings down leg and Bell goes for a glance, Haddin makes a diving take. Umpire Dharmasena says not out, but also doesn't signal wide, indicating perhaps that was off thigh pad. Replays suggest it may have missed everything - McKay probably lucky that wasn't called wide"
19,"McKay to Bell, 1 leg bye worked away to the leg side"
20,"McKay to Cook, no run Cook is defending off the back foot now"
21,"McKay to Cook, 1 run on the pads now and Cook flicks it away towards fine leg, just ticking the scoreboard over gently at this stage"
22,"Johnson to Cook, no run again Johnson beats Cook outside off! Really had him squared up here, angled in towards off and just straightening enough, Cook's feet go nowhere and he's lucky not to edge this"
23,"Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs Cook picks up the first boundary of the innings, just a casual sort of flick through square leg as Johnson gives him one on middle and leg"
24,"Johnson to Cook, 1 run steered away towards fine leg and Faulkner does the fielding"
25,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run Johnson bangs this one in short and Bell works it away off the body behind square, awkward delivery"

30,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run Cook again goes for the cut but this one beats the bat - Coulter-Nile giving him a little width here"

32,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run on off stump now and Bell defends"
33,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, 1 run shortish and wideish and cuttish to third mannish"
34,"Johnson to Bell, no run Johnson bangs it in towards the hips, Bell just works it down towards leg"
35,"Johnson to Bell, no run bouncer, nice and accurate too but Bell is keen to play, tries to sway back and steer it over the cordon but doesn't connect - Johnson is interested in a caught behind appeal but Haddin isn't"
36,"Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs Bell has had enough of waiting around, he flashes outside off and crunches Johnson uppishly through cover for his first boundary"
37,"Johnson to Bell, no run Bell drives hard again, this time along the ground and straight to mid-off"
38,"Johnson to Bell, no run nearly played on! Bell defends outside off and this skews off the inside edge just past the stumps - that was close!"

40,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run Bell launches at this, tries to drive Coulter-Nile through mid-off but finds the fielder"

42,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, 3 runs now Cook is taking on Coulter-Nile, too, with a lovely cover drive that is chased down by McKay with a sliding save on the boundary"
43,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs Bell picks up a boundary this time, nice attractive shot too as he clips off his pads wide of mid-on and although it was uppishly struck it was safe, lovely placement"
44,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, 2 runs and wouldn't you know it, a slip comes out and Bell edges this one through the new gap, though angled it down so it wasn't really catchable height - third man collects"
45,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run defended towards the off side now"
46,"McKay to Cook, no run Cook defends a delivery that came at him at 125kph"
47,"McKay to Cook, 3 runs on the pads now and Cook waits on it, clips comfortably through midwicket but it's chased down inside the boundary by Maxwell"

50,"McKay to Cook, no run McKay hurls this one down with a Sharapova-like grunt, Cook nudges off the pads to midwicket"
51,"McKay to Cook, FOUR runs poor ball, short and down leg side and all Cook had to do was help this on its way to fine leg - which he did. McKay is chastising himself at that delivery"

53,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run Bell looks to smash Coulter-Nile over midwicket now but miscues away to the off side"
54,"Coulter-Nile to Bell, 1 run hmmm, Bell has nearly thrown it away here as he tries to launch it over mid-off and it lobs up in the air, Faulkner runs back from mid-off and nearly gets to it - Bell is lucky to survive there"
55,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run beaten outside off now as Coulter-Nile angles it across and draws Cook into the drive"
56,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run pushed away towards mid-off"
57,"Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run driven away to mid-off once again"
58,"McKay to Bell, no run accurate from McKay on off stump, Bell just defends after a couple of more adventurous swings at Coulter-Nile last over"
59,"McKay to Bell, no run Bell walks down the pitch, keen to get the scoreboard moving further, McKay drags the length back and makes Bell defend"
60,"McKay to Bell, 1 wide horribly wide of off now, McKay has done this a few times today, just squirting it far too wide"
61,"McKay to Bell, FOUR runs now Bell gets some width and goes with it, takes a swing at McKay and scoops this up over point and the ball runs away to the boundary, confident shot and well executed by Bell"
62,"McKay to Bell, 2 runs he continues to have a real crack does Bell, tries the big aerial straight drive and doesn't quite middle it, Bailey running back from mid-on can't quite get there in time and has to content himself with keeping it to two runs"
63,"McKay to Bell, no run left alone outside off"
64,"McKay to Bell, no run Bell walks at McKay again and defends"
65,"Faulkner to Cook, no run starts at 132kph and fullish outside off, Cook drives to mid-off"

69,"Faulkner to Bell, no run fuller on the pads, Bell pushes to leg"
70,"Faulkner to Bell, 1 run late cut again, Bell does love that shot, and it continues to bring him safe runs"
71,"Maxwell to Bell, 1 run tossed up on the pads and Bell works it through midwicket"
72,"Maxwell to Cook, OUT Maxwell strikes! Around the wicket to Cook, who drives at a half-volley but does nothing more than send it back in the direction of the bowler, who takes a sharp catch low to his right. Cook will be kicking himself!"
73,"Maxwell to Root, no run Root drives but can't beat point - there's a really tight field inside the ring to try to keep Root on strike"
74,"Maxwell to Root, 2 runs Root is a touch lucky here, gets it away fine off the toe of the bat to get himself off the mark"
75,"Maxwell to Root, no run driven down towards mid-on"
76,"Maxwell to Root, no run fullish from Maxwell, not giving it time to turn, Root drives to mid-off with a clunky sort of sound"
77,"Johnson to Bell, 1 run soft hands from Bell as he just guides this one through square leg for a single"
78,"Johnson to Root, no run accurate at 143kph and Root defends"
79,"Johnson to Root, no run uppishly driven, very uppishly driven towards mid-off and Root is fortunate he didn't get a fraction more on that as it's bounced just short of the fielder"
80,"Johnson to Root, OUT Johnson gets Root! It seemed inevitable, and it's an lbw that gets him. Johnson gets this one to swing back in a fraction, at pace, and the only thing as slow as Root's attempt to get the bat down in time is Dharmasena's delayed decision to give that out. As he did in the first ODI, Root wants a review and as was the case then, he is still out. It was an umpire's call, replays suggestin"
81,"Johnson to Ballance, 1 wide swings this one down leg"
82,"Johnson to Ballance, no run shortish at 142kph but it's outside off, so Ballance isn't in danger - though he dabbed the bat at it perhaps unnecessarily"
83,"Maxwell to Bell, 1 run tossed up on the stumps from around the wicket, Bell now with two partners gone is happy to just work this through midwicket"

88,"Maxwell to Ballance, no run again Maxwell tosses it up and tries to draw Ballance into the drive, he does go at it but mistimes"

90,"Clarke to Ballance, no run on the back foot, crunched to short cover"
91,"Clarke to Ballance, 1 run Clarke is tossing this up, slowly, and Ballance drives down through mid-on"

93,"Clarke to Ballance, 1 run driven through midwicket for another single"
94,"Clarke to Bell, 2 runs tossed up wide of off, Bell was advancing and had to adjust for the width and turn, did well in the end to steer through point and pick up a couple of runs"
95,"Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run turns this one to the leg side for a single"
96,"Maxwell to Bell, 1 run this delivery heading down the leg side to backward square"
97,"Maxwell to Ballance, no run defended on the front foot by Ballance"

107,"Maxwell to Ballance, 2 runs pitches this a bit wider as he drives this straight to the man at sweeper cover, with the pair able to complete a couple"
108,"Maxwell to Ballance, OUT and Maxwell beats an increasingly fidgety Ballance as he lofts one just around off stump, with the flight drawing Ballance down the track before the left-hander, trying to work this leg side, misses the ball completely, and turns around just in time to see Haddin collect the ball and whip the bails off. Maxwell strikes again and suddenly England seemed to have lost their way at 78 f"
109,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run lets the keeper collect this one as it spins away from the bat"
110,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run steers this one down to long-off for a single"

113,"Clarke to Bell, no run defended away to the off side by Bell"
114,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run advances down the track to this tossed up delivery, with Bell looking to hit through mid-off, but instead hits it straight back to Clarke, who gets a touch on it as it just misses the non-striker's stumps, with Morgan backing up a bit too much, and was well short of his ground"
115,"Clarke to Morgan, (no ball) 1 run down the track and Morgan figures he has got a handle on the pitch as he looks to clear midwicket with a big hit, but instead gets this to go higher than farther, with deep midwicket steadying himself under it to take the catch. Morgan has made an inquiry with the umpire about the fact that there are too many fielders outside of the circle. Currently verifying if this is"
116,"Clarke to Bell, 1 run turned away to square leg for a single"
117,"Clarke to Morgan, 1 run once again worked to square leg for one"

232,"Faulkner to Buttler, no run drives down towards mid-on and can't beat the field"
233,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run off the mark with a late cut, just waits on this and steers a single to third man"
234,"Faulkner to Morgan, no run Faulkner goes for the yorker now and Morgan can only push it back in the direction from which it came"
235,"Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs Morgan tries to lift the tempo while the field is up, and he gets away with a boundary. He backed away and swung hard outside off, his thickish edge flew over the infield and bounced away to the boundary"
236,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide Coulter-Nile goes the bouncer and this one has been called a wide - just a touch too high"
237,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run again Coulter-Nile goes short, this time outside off and not quite as high, Buttler shapes to play and then leaves it alone"
238,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run quick single as Buttler nudges this to off, he's a little hesitant at first but gets to the bowler's end in time to beat Bailey's direct hit"
239,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run cut away towards backward point and Morgan can't find the gap"
240,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run Morgan looks to open the shoulders and smash this through midwicket, can't quite get it where he wants it though and finds mid-on"
241,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run good length from Coulter-Nile means Morgan can't do much except steer this to third man for a single"
242,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 2 runs this one stays a touch low and Buttler does well to nudge a couple through midwicket"

244,"Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run steered off the face of the bat towards backward point"
245,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run Buttler uses the angle to work it through square leg"
246,"Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run Morgan backs off a touch and tries to force a yorker through cover, finds the fielder but also a single"
247,"Faulkner to Buttler, 2 runs again the angle helps Buttler work this through midwicket but the boundary is protected so he can only pick up two"
248,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run drives down towards long-on"
249,"Johnson to Buttler, 1 run Buttler turns this off his hips towards square leg"
250,"Johnson to Morgan, no run interesting, no wide call from the umpire now as Morgan goes for a hook to a ball down leg - that was a long way down so the umpire must have felt there was some glove on that. Don't think there was - in any case it bounced short of Haddin"
251,"Johnson to Morgan, 1 wide well, this one has been called wide now, a bouncer that is probably just a touch too high as Morgan ducks"
252,"Johnson to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan is in busy Michael Hussey-mode here as he pushes through cover and calls and runs quickly, hares back for a second run"
253,"Johnson to Morgan, no run defended back towards Johnson"
254,"Johnson to Morgan, 1 leg bye swinging down leg but the pad of Morgan gets in the way, and he picks up a leg bye"

258,"McKay to Buttler, 3 runs Buttler decides he's seen enough and backs away, lifts McKay over cover but didn't quite have the timing for it to reach the boundary"
259,"McKay to Morgan, 1 run Morgan advances down the pitch but has to adjust his stroke and settles for a quick single nudged to point"
260,"McKay to Buttler, 2 runs again Buttler uses the wrists nicely to flick this behind square from an off-stump line and his running is sharp enough to make that two"
261,"McKay to Buttler, 1 run again Buttler works it through leg, makes it a pretty productive over - 10 off it with no boundaries"
262,"Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler goes over the top now and doesn't quite time it, but had enough muscle behind it to get it away to the boundary at midwicket"
263,"Johnson to Buttler, 1 run slower bouncer now from Johnson and Buttler shapes to hook, then adjusts and settles for a single to leg"
264,"Johnson to Morgan, SIX runs super shot! Morgan has had a real crack at Johnson here, uses the pace of the ball and whacks this over cover with such timing that it has cleared the boundary!"

266,"Johnson to Buttler, 1 run Buttler goes back in his crease and gets a single to third man off a thickish edge"
267,"Johnson to Morgan, 1 run Johnson goes for the yorker but Morgan is good enough to work it behind square for a single"
268,"Faulkner to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan lifts this over wide midwicket and it's well timed but reeled in on the boundary"
269,"Faulkner to Morgan, no run Morgan advances but his drive can't beat cover"
270,"Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs powerful shot! Morgan has crunched Faulkner over long-on with such good timing and strength that it's made it ten rows back in the crowd, he could really get England's total moving here"
271,"Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs another boundary, this time he's manouevred it through square leg where there is a gap"
272,"Faulkner to Morgan, no run good yorker - Morgan can't do anything but keep that out"
273,"Faulkner to Morgan, 2 runs tries for another heave through leg but doesn't quite time this one well enough to reach the square leg boundary"
274,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run Buttler backs off and tries to force but can't beat the field"
275,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run goes for the bouncer now and Buttler's hook bounces out to Warner at deep midwicket"

277,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run yet again Buttler tries to create space by backing away but Coulter-Nile does well to adjust and follows him, gives him no room and Buttler can only keep it out"
278,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run oh dear, Coulter-Nile has missed the chance for a wicket - by dropping the catch himself! Buttler has top-edged and this ball flies high into the off side, Bailey comes in and seems to want the catch but Coulter-Nile calls it, then seems to be in position but grasses the chance - then grasses himself, kneeling on the ground in anguish"
279,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, SIX runs huge six! Morgan has timed this one magnificently, launched it way over the long-off boundary to add insult to injury for Coulter-Nile"
280,"Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run good yorker and all Buttler can do is push it through the off side"
281,"Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs Morgan is on fire here! He's whipped a full toss off the middle-and-leg line and helped it on its way over square leg for six"
282,"Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs another six! Morgan has 96 now and this is the biggest six of the lot, he has launched an enormous swipe over midwicket to the long boundary - and it's gone many, many rows back into the crowd"
283,"Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run he won't get the hundred just yet, forces a single through cover"
284,"Faulkner to Buttler, no run good yorker now as Faulkner gets the length right, Buttler pushes it back to him"
285,"Faulkner to Buttler, FOUR runs this yorker is not quite right though, just a fraction too short and Buttler slaps this half-volley over extra cover for four more runs"
286,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run Morgan gets a low full toss but can't quite find the gap, picks up a single on the bounce to deep midwicket"

288,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run Morgan times this but doesn't place it, finds the man at mid-off"
289,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, FOUR runs what a way to bring up the hundred! Morgan gets a shortish ball and simply - well, he makes it look simple - helps it on its way over the keeper's head where it bounces away to the boundary. That's his sixth ODI century and he's put England on track for a hefty total"
290,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run takes a swing at this through leg but just a single"
291,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 leg bye once again Coulter-Nile does well to follow Buttler as he backs away, can only manage a leg bye"
292,"Johnson to Buttler, no run Buttler tries to get fancy but it doesn't work, he's walked across well outside leg and tried to scoop it over Haddin, but doesn't manage to get hold of it and Haddin gloves the ball"
293,"Johnson to Buttler, SIX runs this one Buttler plays more conventionally, thumps it down the ground towards long-off and that looks to be clearing the rope - Marsh steps over the rope and jumps and pushes the ball back in. Hmm, he launched himself from outside the field of play and was in the air when he touched the ball to force it back into play. That must be six, surely? And has been changed subsequently"
294,"Johnson to Buttler, 1 wide wide of off"
295,"Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs crunched away through midwicket now and Maxwell dives to reel it in inside the boundary"
296,"Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler gets lucky now as he swipes hard and a top edge flies over the head of Haddin for four more"

301,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run thumped through the leg side now"
302,"Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT Buttler skies this one and Clarke runs in from mid-on, appears at first to misjudge it and has to dive forward a bit but does indeed complete the catch, so Coulter-Nile gets the wicket he missed earlier, and England lose their sixth wicket, but Buttler has done a fine job"
303,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run Morgan jams down on a yorker and forces a single through off"

305,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run worked away through the leg side"
306,"Faulkner to Morgan, OUT Morgan gets a low full toss and miscues it, finds the man at deep mid-off and that's the end of a wonderful innings of 106, Morgan has really given England's bowlers a strong target to defend"
307,"Faulkner to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan takes a swing and picks up a single through leg side"
308,"Faulkner to Jordan, no run Jordan gets a slower bouncer and can't put bat on ball"
309,"Faulkner to Jordan, no run again he can't put bat on a short ball"
310,"Faulkner to Jordan, no run again Faulkner goes short and again Jordan can't hit it"
311,"Faulkner to Jordan, 2 runs Jordan swipes and does make contact with this one, picks up two through the leg side despite a tight call with Bresnan completing the second at the non-striker's end"
312,"So England have finished with 8 for 296, leaving Australia chasing 297 for victory. (Note: After the innings break this was updated to 8 for 300 due to an umpiring error that called ball 47.2 a two, when it should have been a six). What a fantastic innings from Eoin Morgan, his hundred was the difference between a sub-par total and something much more competitive. Australia thought they had him cheaply when he was"
313,"We are back live at the Gabba. It will be Rankin to bowl to Warner. And during the break the match officials have made a correction to England's score. It's up to 300 and Buttler's score is now 49. That's because the ball at 47.2, when Shaun Marsh stepped outside the boundary and knocked the ball back in play, was not called a six when it should have been. The officials have now rectified that."
314,"Rankin to Warner, 2 runs and Warner starts it off with a flash to this shortish length outside off which is played to extra-cover"

340,"Rankin to Marsh, no run drives this full length one to the fielder at long-off"

346,"Jordan to Marsh, 1 run another full one, this time on the pads, as Marsh looks for the clip, but ends up being hit outside the line. Marsh presses on for the run, and is lucky to make his ground before the throw from the mid-off fielder. Was very tough and go that one"
347,"Jordan to Warner, no run surprises Warner with a short one which has him ducking for cover"
348,"Jordan to Warner, OUT Jordan takes a spectacular return catch to remove the dangerous Warner as the left-hander hammers back a length ball to the right of Jordan, who instinctively stretches out his hand to grab hold of the chance. Amazing that it even managed to stick, especially with how hard Warner had struck that back. Removes a dangerous thorn in the backside for the English"

399,"Bresnan to Marsh, no run Bresnan strikes Marsh on the pads as the bowler goes up for an appeal. Dharmasena is not interested though, and after a brief consultation, they decide to go for the review.

458,"Rankin to Haddin, no run banged in short of a length and Haddin steers it to backward point"
459,"Rankin to Haddin, no run again Haddin rocks back into the crease and can't beat point"
460,"Rankin to Haddin, no run beaten outside off, Rankin follows the shorter ones with a fuller ball that draws Haddin out and he can't get bat on ball"
461,"Rankin to Haddin, no run solidly defended by Haddin"

465,"Root to Maxwell, no run pushed away to cover but can't find the gap"
466,"Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell gets adventurous now and it works! He's gone for the reverse ... hmm, sweep, I suppose, but it's more of a swipe that just clears square leg and runs away to the boundary"
467,"Root to Maxwell, no run pushed away to the leg side"
468,"Root to Maxwell, 1 run nudges a single through point"
469,"Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run pulled away through square leg"

488,"Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs once again Maxwell picks the gap behind backward point with a reverse sweep - how does Cook stop that?"
489,"Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs he's tried it again from a full toss and this is four more! This one runs finer and there is nothing England can do to stop it"

495,"Jordan to Maxwell, 2 leg byes nice ball from Jordan that nips back in off the seam and Maxwell tries to steer it to third man, but it nips in so much it strikes him on the thigh pad - Jordan asks the lbw question but it looked high"

497,"Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs Maxwell opens the face and steers this behind point for a single to third man"

505,"Bopara to Maxwell, no run pushed away to the off side"
506,"Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell gets another boundary through the backward point area but not with a reverse shot this time - it's just a really well placed late cut"
507,"Bopara to Maxwell, no run defended back down the pitch"
508,"Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run Haddin starts the powerplay sedately enough, just a nudged single to mid-off"
509,"Bresnan to Maxwell, FOUR runs good timing from Maxwell, albeit from a poor delivery - low full toss just a touch down leg and Maxwell helps it on its way behind fine leg. Almost a yorker - almost, but not quite"
510,"Bresnan to Maxwell, 3 runs Maxwell hooks this one over square leg and picks up three more"
511,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run Haddin tries to force through cover but can't find the gap"
512,"Bresnan to Haddin, 2 runs shortish and Haddin pulls through square leg"
513,"Bresnan to Haddin, no run driven down to mid-off but too hard - means they can't take the single"
514,"Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye leg bye is all that Maxwell can manage as Jordan aims at the leg-stump"

516,"Jordan to Haddin, 2 runs clipped away through midwicket for another couple of runs"
517,"Jordan to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin finds the off-side boundary now as Jordan gives him something short and wide, Haddin crunches a cut through cover point"
518,"Jordan to Haddin, FOUR runs super shot! Haddin may just be capable of rescuing Australia as he did in the Tests! He's just lifted this over extra cover and there's no man out there so if he hits it cleanly - as he did - it's a safe shot for four"
519,"Jordan to Haddin, 1 run down leg and Haddin works it away behind square"
520,"Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 run plays with soft hands to the off side as Maxwell brings up a well-played fifty. Australia will hope he can continue on longer"

540,"Bopara to Coulter-Nile, 1 run slower ball which is helped to square leg"
541,"Bopara to Faulkner, 1 run pushes this one gently to the off side with the intent to run a quick single, but is hesitant as he sees his partner turn back, but then the pair decide to risk it, and luckily enough another fumble affords Nathan that extra split-second to get in the dive"
542,"Bopara to Coulter-Nile, no run fuller one shaping in as Nathan inside-edges, but luckily away from the stumps"

545,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 wide going down the leg side as the umpire calls a wide"
546,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run plays this softly to the man at point as they embark on a quick single, but the throw would have had the non-striker run out by miles. Morgan, after firing in the throw, grabs hold of his right knee. Hopefully he hasn't done himself in there"

557,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run defends this one carefully with soft hands to the off side for one"

559,"Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run ends up playing this reverse-swinging delivery back to the bowler"
560,"Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run fires in a leg side yorker which Nathan fails to get away. Really should have done better with this one"
561,"Stokes to Coulter-Nile, OUT gets one to swing in from just outside off as Nathan goes for the big heave down the ground, but misses the ball as this careens low into his right pad, which is definitely in line of the stumps. Doesn't look to have got an inside-edge as this one continued onto the pads, so fairplay to the Australians for not wasting the review"

563,"Bopara to Faulkner, 1 run low full toss just outside off as this is played straight to long-on"

573,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run leans into a drive through the covers, but is kept to just one"
574,"Stokes to Johnson, no run tries a slower one on a length which Johnson reads late as this goes harmlessly past the bat to the keeper"

583,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run pitches this up as Faulkner is able to get it down to long-on for a single. This leaves McKay exposed at the other end, but he too can hit a long ball"

588,"Bresnan to McKay, no run short ball just outside off which is defended off the back foot to the off side"

590,"Bresnan to McKay, 1 run short delivery on the off stump, McKay pulls it to deep mid-wicket"

596,"Stokes to Faulkner, no run bludgeons this with his rendition of Dhoni's helicopter, but this one unfortunately finds mid-off"
597,"Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs dropped back of a length and this is all Faulkner needed as he goes after this with a pull shot. Root, running in from deep square leg, is able to get a hand on it before the boundary, but the momentum carries him over, ends up being called a six by the third umpire. Root really deserved that one as he was in control, but unfortunately cost his side two extra runs at the least"

602,"Bresnan to Faulkner, 2 runs on the back foot as this is pulled down to deep midwicket, with the pair running for their lives as they are able to scamper back for the second, and beat the incoming throw from the deep at the keeper's end"
603,"Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run once again negotiates this shortish length slower ball to the leg side for a single"
604,"Bresnan to McKay, no run decides to fire in a bouncer which for all intensive purposes should have been called a wide by the third umpire, but Dharmasena just walks away from the spot. England lucky to get away with that one"
605,"Stokes to Faulkner, no run this one was heading down the pads as Faulkner decides to go with it and hit over cow corner, but gets a bit too early into the shot, with the ball falling safely to his right"
606,"Stokes to Faulkner, no run gets in a yorker on middle and leg which Faulkner is able to dig out successfully"
607,"Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs back of a length and just crunched over the midwicket boundary for a huge six. Such a clean swing of the blade as this one just rises and rises into the stands"
608,"Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs in the slot and suddenly images of Ishant start to come to the surface as Faulkner clears his front leg, and then clears the long-on boundary with another easy swing of the bat. This is sensational hitting from the Tasmanian allrounder"
609,"Stokes to Faulkner, no run third time not so lucky for Faulkner as clearly the adrenaline is getting to him now. Is lucky not to get bowled as this goes down the leg stump to the keeper"
610,"Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run fires it in on the blockhole as Faulkner eases this one down to long-on for a single, and more importantly for Australia, retain the striek"
611,"Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs tries a slower bouncer which Faulkner is too early on as the ball runs off the face, and bounces over the keeper's outstretched gloves to the third man rope. Australia now need 8 off 5"
612,"Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs sees this one early as Faulkner readies himself to this shorter one just outside off, before pulling this magnificently to midwicket for a one-bounce four which bifurcates the two fielders on the leg side"
613,"Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs able to find the gap on the off side as he backs away to squirt this away through extra-cover, beating the fielder near the 30-yard circle, as this travels to the rope, sparking off scenes of delirium across the Gabba"
614,"Faulkner jumps in celebration as the Australians have pulled off an impressive heist here in Brisbane. Faulkner is proving to be a really valuable commodity for Australia of late, especially with the bat in hand. This has to go down as one of the all-time great Australia-England matches. The England fielders are in shock and Michael Slater is saluting Faulkner."
615,"I have only ever seen this for a player's last match or when they play a truly special innings, and I guess the latter can describe Faulkner's knock as he is given a guard of honour by the Australian players and backroom staff. The Gabba has simply taken off over these last few minutes. Australia simply can not lose it seems."
616,"Have you returned yet from the clouds? What a win this was for Australia as Faulkner proved that the Mohali heist was not a one-off. Can't recall a greater eruption from an Australian crowd in recent years. England will be slightly shell-shocked by what has just transpired, but they will need to pick themselves up by the straps and get mentally ready for the 3rd ODI, which will be played in Sydney in two days' tim"
617,Australia won by 1 wicket (with 3 balls remaining)
618,"Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS"
