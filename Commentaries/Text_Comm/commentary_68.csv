242,Innings break Brilliant performance from India's bowlers. Australia never got going at any stage after Finch fell in the second over. Shami was outstanding up front and the spinners strangled Australia's middle order. Australia struggled to rotate the strike and then boundaries became hard to find. India will be looking
