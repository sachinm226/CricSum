430,"Ali to Khawaja, 1 run fully forward once more"
431,"Ali to Finch, no run a drag-down from Moeen as he ramps up the pace, a flat-batted pull round the corner, contact at ankle height, but Root does well to intercept behind square"
432,"Ali to Finch, no run speared in on the leg stump, defended"
433,"Ali to Finch, SIX runs pounded majestically over long-on! Woakes was back on the rope but that was belligerently nailed, leaning back, short arms, full power, pounded out of the arc and over the rope!"

435,"Rashid to Khawaja, no run advancing to the pitch, a scuffed drive back up the track"

441,"Ali to Finch, no run fast and flat, blocked"

463,"Stokes to Finch, no run banged in short, firmly pulled, just short of Moeen at short midwicket!"
464,"Stokes to Finch, 2 runs smashed with intent towards the Mound Stand rope and that's a brilliant sprawling dive from Archer! Intercepting a violent drive"

466,"Stokes to Khawaja, 1 run tapped to backward point, off the back foot, more easy strike rotation"

472,"Rashid to Finch, no run fenced off the back foot into the covers, solid connection"
473,"Rashid to Finch, FOUR runs lots more air, and that's brilliantly timed and placed! Finch waited, and waited, and waited, then laced his drive clean through the infield. Perfection. He's into the nineties"
474,"Rashid to Finch, no run solid in defence to seal another domineering over. Rashid has been tidy but lacked threat today"
475,"Stokes to Khawaja, no run back of a length, outside off, chopped down into the crease as Khawaja looks to run the single through third man"
476,"Stokes to Khawaja, OUT bowled him! 90mph from Stokes, right into the blockhole, and Khawaja was simply beaten for pace as this shaped back in as he wafted rather loosely across the line. A vital incision to end a burgeoning stand"

478,"Stokes to Finch, 1 run wider on the crease, banging in the short ball, Finch rolls his wrists on a pull to backward square"

480,"Archer to Finch, 2 runs open-faced poke to backward point"

493,"Archer to Finch, 2 runs whipped to fine leg and a misfield allows him to back for two! A brilliant century from the skipper!"
494,"Archer to Finch, OUT caught at fine leg! What has he done? A century and out. A high short ball, he was sucked into hooking, it was high and outside his eyeline, he gets a top edge that flies to fine leg and Woakes, after misfielding to concede his hundred, hangs on to the catch. Big blow landed by England"
495,"Archer to Smith, FOUR runs tickled fine for four! He shuffled across outside off, got a shorter length and tickled it fine"
496,"Archer to Smith, 1 run 118kph slower ball on off, he's back and across, working this behind square for a single"

503,"Wood to Smith, FOUR runs opens the face and runs fine of third man! Short outside off, he just opened the blade, used the pace and ran it fine of third man"
504,"Archer to Maxwell, no run 142kph back of a length on off, he is back and across and defending"

521,"Rashid to Smith, no run wrong un, Smith doesn't pick it until late and is taken on the pad"

527,"Wood to Cummins, 1 run short into the ribs, 88mph, he pulls awkwardly down to fine leg"
528,"Woakes to Cummins, OUT edged and taken by Buttler! Good delivery. Good length outside off, seam was wobbling, he drives without much footwork, it takes the edge and Buttler dives low to his right to hang on"
529,"Woakes to Starc, 1 run 112kph, short slower ball, he rides the bounce and runs this to third man"
530,"Woakes to Carey, 1 run nearly a run out! Short into the body, he tried to pull, it comes off the body, and rolls down the pitch, Starc runs through and barely beats the throw from Woakes but it didn't hit"

544,"Rashid to Smith, 1 run, OUT horror mix up and Stoinis is run out as they end up at the same end! Smith drives past cover wide of long off, Stoinis touches for one and sprint back for two and Smith doesn't run! Stoinis would have beaten the throw running to the non-striker's but he keeps running to the rooms. Rashid gathers and lobs it Buttler!"
545,"Rashid to Carey, no run tossed up and he drives to cover"
546,"Archer to Carey, 1 wide full toss wide outside the guideline and called"

559,Innings break 2.05pm Alex Carey's late flourish gives Australia something to bowl at. They made a mess of an outstanding start. Aaron Finch and David Warner were superb up front on a difficult pitch but neither could kick on to a big score. Finch got out for exactly 100. Warner made 53 and then the side fell away from there.
560,"Michael Hussey, Graeme Swann and Murali Kartik give their thoughts on Australia's total on the live show. Andrew Miller will be back to start the chase in a little while."
561,"2.28pm Well hello again. Are you ready for the showdown? England's target is 286 - perhaps 40 runs fewer than Australia would have anticipated after 30 overs, and meat and drink for a side that has been putting 300 on the board for fun in this tournament ... until of course that nerve-shattering implosion against Sri Lanka last week ... is today redemption day, or the beginning of the end? If Australia can hold out, they will be"
562,"2.33pm So, out come England's openers, Jonny Bairstow and James Vince. Mitchell Starc, Australia's primary menace, was feeling his hamstring when batting at the end of their innings ... he's not taking the newest of new balls ... Jason Behrendorff has first dibs. Interesting..."
563,"Behrendorff to Vince, no run left-arm over the wicket with a tight leg-stump line to the right-hander, solid in defence, up to mid-on"
564,"Behrendorff to Root, no run outside off, and this one nips off the seam away towards the cordon"
565,"Behrendorff to Root, no run up on the toes, punched with stiff forearms into the covers"
566,"Behrendorff to Root, no run ploughing a tight line across the right-hander, nip away from the bat once more as Root leaves alone"
567,"Behrendorff to Root, FOUR runs short, wide, chancy! It was confident enough in the end, but a touch tentative on the cut as Root placed the ball past a leaping Maxwell at backward point. England are up and running ..."
568,"Starc to Bairstow, no run jeepers, that's a good leave! Outside off, nipping back in, skims past the off stump with good carry! Starc hitting the seam from the get-go"
569,"Starc to Bairstow, no run wider line, 147kph, which isn't too shabby, nips away as Bairstow leaves alone"
570,"Starc to Bairstow, 2 runs wristy from Bairstow... not quite to the pitch, not quite timed either, but plinked through the gap in the covers with an open face and lots of momentum"
571,"Starc to Bairstow, 1 run fuller length outside off, Bairstow brings out the kitchen sink and scuffs a wild drive on the bounce to third man"
572,"Starc to Root, FOUR runs whoops, can't bowl there to Root! Swinging on a leg-stump line, ever further past the stumps, Root places bat on ball and tickles it fine through the finest of fine legs"
573,"Starc to Root, no run a calm leave on a fuller length outside off. It's been a bit skittish from England so far, but no further chances..."
574,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run pops from just back of a length, angled across Bairstow who is anchored on the back foot, wary of the inswinger. Beaten outside off"
575,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run attempted pull, whistles into the midriff"
576,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR runs perfect timing, meeting the inswing with a clip off the pads. Full face on contact, clean through long-on"
577,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run solidly forward, defending on off stump"
578,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run tight into the pads, Bairstow loses one hand on the bat as he attempts to deflect off the hip"
579,"Starc to Root, no run driven, loosely, and passes the inside edge! Tentative and extravagant from Root, very hard hands, and too late on the stroke too"
580,"Starc to Root, no run stiff-limbed once more, as Root fences this off the front foot into the covers"
581,"Starc to Morgan, no run banged into the hip, Morgan shuffles across his crease"
582,"Starc to Morgan, no run loose from Morgan! Staying very leg-sided in order to free up the drive, but there was big late outswing to the left-hander, and it zipped past the edge!"
583,"Starc to Morgan, no run cramped on the pads, speared across the left-hander. A wicket maiden!"
584,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run outside off, through to the keeper once again"
585,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run tentative from Bairstow! Another poke forward on off stump, paralysed by fear of the inswinger, and nearly allows this to wriggle down into his crease"
586,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, 1 leg bye there is the inswinger, but it's on the pads. Can't clip it fine"
587,"Behrendorff to Morgan, 1 wide fired past the leg stump"
588,"Behrendorff to Morgan, no run width, and an attempted slash through the off-side, but can't connect properly"
589,"Behrendorff to Morgan, FOUR runs fierce from Morgan! Skipping to the pitch like a frisky spring lamb, and plundered through long-off! Intent from the skipper! Wolf in lamb's clothing"
590,"Behrendorff to Morgan, no run anchored to the crease this time as Behrendorff finds extra nip outside off, and leaves it alone"
591,"Starc to Bairstow, no run back of a length, tight line, poked into the leg side with a closed face"
592,"Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs Bairstow at his best! Seizing on the half-volley outside off stump, and simply extends his arms through the line of the ball, from a solid base. No stopping that!"
593,"Starc to Bairstow, no run back of a length, tighter line, that's excellently left"
594,"Starc to Bairstow, 1 run inswing once more, but Bairstow is alive to it, waiting deep in his crease and nudging to the leg side"
595,"Starc to Stokes, no run another left-hander meets the outswinger with a tentative push. Gosh, this is getting lively"
596,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run driven off an inside edge, back down the pitch"
597,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run driven, without conviction, meeting the full length, just a touch of inswing taking the ball away from the meat of the bat"
598,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run pressed with caution into the off side, meeting one that shapes back into the right-hander with hard hands"
599,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run on the back foot, defended back down the track to the bowler"
600,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR runs skims over mid-off! Aaron Finch on a stepladder would have swallowed that! Bairstow planted the front foot, walloped through the line, really high on the bat and crowbarred to the rope with a huge slice of fortune!"

608,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run fenced off the back foot, into the leg side"
609,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run a flat-footed mow! Keeps low to beat the waft, but that was loose either way"
610,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR runs pounded off the back foot! Bairstow's cover driving, off front foot and back, can be sublime. Back of a length this time, and piercing the covers like a high-pitched screech"

612,"Behrendorff to Stokes, no run back of a length, outside off, solidly blocked into the off side"

618,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run fenced to midwicket once again but without the timing"
619,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run firm in defence, that's the Powerplay done and dusted. Australia's 'phase', you have to say!"

622,"Behrendorff to Stokes, FOUR runs emphatic from Stokes! He's off the mark with a Morgan-esque shimmy and slam, freeing the arms for a wild slap through the covers. Three steps down the pitch"
623,"Behrendorff to Stokes, no run Behrendorff gets straight back onto that awkward popping length. Stokes defends with the inside half of his bat, on the back foot"
624,"Behrendorff to Stokes, no run another advance to the pitch, Behrendorff hauls his length back by a yard and forces a defensive block into the covers"
625,"Behrendorff to Stokes, no run deep in the crease this time from Stokes, no attempt to disrupt the length this time, so Behrendorff drops it on a sixpence and lets the pitch do the rest. Blocked. This is a thrilling mini-duel"

627,"Cummins to Stokes, no run solidly forward in defence"
628,"Cummins to Stokes, no run ooh, loose .... back of a length, an attempted chop through point but this hops over the swishing blade"

630,"Cummins to Stokes, no run outside off, no stroke this time"

1072,"Starc to Rashid, FOUR runs back-to-back boundaries, the patient has a pulse! Rashid has been working on this stroke, an open-faced wristy steer from deep in the crease, through the covers"
1073,"Starc to Rashid, no run slower ball, hops over the stumps as Rashid gets in a tangle"
1074,"Well, Jarrod Kimber called it before the match. There's a World Cup pedigree that Australia can tap into, one that England can only gaze upon longingly. Despite a gutsy 89 from Ben Stokes - one that was ended by the ball of the tournament so far - they never came close to challenging their target."
1075,"6.02pm Wow. Behrendorff, five wickets. Starc, four wickets. Left-arm quicks, 9 for 87 all told! England have been yorker-ised in the World Cup Ashes showdown, and now their campaign really is on the ropes!"
1076,"6.10pm Bharath Seervi has dug out the instances of nine wickets being shared by opening bowlers in a WC game. It's a rare feat, more usually achieved against, err, lesser teams"
1077,"""Behrendorff bowled beautifully, we've you've got a guy who can swing the ball back down the line to the right handers, that's an asset. And Warner is playing nicely, people say it's not the Warner of old, but there's bowling that demands respect, and today was close to his best. You're looking to be positive, but he got us off to a good start. We're confident with what we've got, and we've won five World Cups in our history."""
1078,"6.19pm Australia in World Cup while defending 275+ targets ... played 25, won 25... Fetch that and bowl me another!"
1079,"As for England, well, it is now looking like fourth or bust ... 12 points is the most that they can now get ... and it would take some freak results for India, New Zealand and Australia not to get more than that. But as Morgan says, their destiny is in their own hands. Beat India and New Zealand, they are through. Beat one of them, and they still have hope. It's not ideal ... but they have two games to reach the semi-finals. They"
1080,"6.21pm So, a final word on the points table. Australia's qualification is secure because they have already won six games - even if others equal their points, they will have more wins which is the first criteria ahead of NRR."
1081,"Sunday at Edgbaston, England v India. It can't come quickly enough! From Andrew Miller, Alex Malcolm and Chandan Duorah, good night"
1082,"6.30pm Right, that's your lot for today. And to think last week, we were worried about the top four being locked out before the end of the round robin ... trust England to keep the group stages lively with their habitual chaos. It was like this in 2011 and 2015 too ... but they remain a vastly better team now than in either of those campaigns, in spite of appearances today. As for Australia, well, the defending champions have jus"
1083,Australia won by 64 runs
