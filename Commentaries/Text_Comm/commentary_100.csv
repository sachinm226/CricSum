0,"Rashid to Smith, 1 run touch short, whipped out to deep midwicket"
1,"Rashid to Finch, 2 wide angled down the leg side, he goes for a dab-sweep, doesn't make contact, rebounds off Buttler's gloves"
2,"Rashid to Smith, 1 run short again, pulled to deep backward square leg"
3,"Rashid to Finch, 1 run uses his feet, this drifts outside leg stump, pushed into the on side"
4,"Rashid to Smith, no run short on leg stump, think Smith was trying to leave this for the wide but it takes his body"
5,"Rashid to Smith, 1 wide this one is way down the leg side"
6,"Rashid to Smith, OUT he's got Smith! What a strike for Rashid. Gets it outside off, just a hint of turn, and a thin nick to Buttler. He actually played outside this, away from his body, and got an inside edge. Not sure Buttler took it entirely cleanly,"
7,"Rashid to Head, no run beats him straightaway! Adjust to the left hander, pushed across him, may have been the googly, Head's feet not going and he fiddles at it"
8,"Plunkett to Finch, 2 runs short of a length outside off, cut through point wide of third man"
9,"Plunkett to Finch, no run full outside off, onto the front foot and punches to cover"

26,"Plunkett to Head, OUT dragged on! We saw a few of those in the Test match here. Good length, outside off, aiming to play square through the off side and gets a bottom edge into the timber. The seventh ball of the over proves a bonus for England!"
27,"Rashid to Finch, no run outside leg stump, the line has been inconsistent so far, flicked to short fine leg"
28,"Rashid to Finch, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! Not sure he picked the googly. Morgan has called the review. Gets forward, spins past the bat and front pad. Actually takes the back leg. And it's done too much, missing leg stump"

30,"Rashid to Marsh, 1 run more air, tossed up at off stump, punched firmly to mid-on who makes a good save but is deep enough for the single"

49,"Ali to Marsh, 1 run tapped into space, down the ground"
50,"Ali to Finch, 1 run flicked in the air, through midwicket, and up comes an effortlessly fluent fifty for Aaron Finch. It's been tough going out there, but he's made it look easy"

61,"Ali to Finch, no run twirly length, on off stump"

73,"Ali to Marsh, 1 run chopped into space at point"

75,"Ali to Marsh, no run onto the front foot once more"
76,"Plunkett to Finch, no run angled into the pads, half an appeal from Plunkett, but the real drama is between the wickets - Marsh wants the single, gets sent back, and wears a shy on his back as he makes his ground"
