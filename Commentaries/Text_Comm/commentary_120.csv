0,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, 1 run Horrid fielding from Pakistan. Afridi is the culprit off his own bowling. Full on middle, played back, the bowler lazily lets it sneak through his hands"
1,"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Short, 1 run full and just a shade outside off, looks like a cutter that grips in the pitch and foils the timing, Short drags a heave but it does not carry to wide long-on"

33,"Faheem to Head, 1 run very full on middle, Head backs away and smears a single down the ground"
34,"Faheem to Carey, OUT Pakistan's fielding veers from ordinary to extraordinary. This rocket drive from Carey seemed destined to fly to the boundary.

57,"Amir to Head, OUT Australia continue to lose their way in the end over. Head holes out to long-on. On a length and outside off, Head swings and gets more height as opposed to distance"
