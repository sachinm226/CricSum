0,"McGrath to Bray, 1 run off the mark straight away, that's massive, a poke to the covers, a dash to the other end and a huge stare from McGrath. Welcome"
1,"McGrath to Porterfield, no run pushed right up there, on the money, and that's defended down by Porterhouse"
2,"McGrath to Porterfield, no run angled across the lefthander, scrambled seam, testing him outside off and he just lets that go. Good ball from Glenn"
3,"McGrath to Porterfield, 1 run slower ball, poked down and they set off. They have to hurry... or they would have done if Mr Mike Hussey-Cricket hadn't fumbled on his way through"
4,"McGrath to Bray, OUT and that's a very early strike indeed, inswing clipped the outside of off stump. Bray didn't move his feet, tried to jab down on it. Failed"
5,"Tait to Porterfield, no run quick and hostile immediately - just shooting that past the outside edge, rearing up and past the head. Gilchrist likes that one"
6,"Tait to Porterfield, no run left alone outside off stump"
7,"Tait to Porterfield, no run full toss at the hips and that's just skewed into the covers. Full tosses are usually gifts, but their angle can be quite awkward"
8,"Tait to Porterfield, no run on middle, short and there's some excitement as that's tucked down to the man at square"
9,"Tait to Porterfield, no run more of the sharp stuff, that one outside off, on a yorker length and the batsman played very late indeed - that ball was too quick for him"
10,"Tait to Porterfield, no run low full toss on leg and that's too quick for him, just crashing into his knee roll, but would have gone on past leg"
11,"McGrath to Morgan, no run brings his bat down on that one, which was full and pitched just in front of him on line with off"
12,"McGrath to Morgan, no run pushed right up there and that's played down into the covers"
13,"McGrath to Morgan, no run left alone outside off as that slinks through on a good length"
14,"McGrath to Morgan, no run that one cut back in, just a touch, at the lefthander - plenty of bounce again and nearly cutting him up"
15,"McGrath to Morgan, no run well struck by Morgan in front of point, but Symonds stops that in the covers"
16,"McGrath to Morgan, no run up there, on leg, and that's pushed to square"
17,"Tait to Porterfield, OUT right up there, straight, on leg, not much swing, too quick for the batsman and not much time's needed for the decision"
18,"Tait to N O'Brien, OUT ...and out again: full toss, and there's no footwork as the batsman drags a huge inside edge back onto his stumps and Tait's on a hat-trick"
19,"Tait to K O'Brien, no run ooh, as close as you can get to a hat-trick without getting a hat-trick - too good that one, squaring him up at 92mph, and it just slinks past his outside edge - just"
20,"Tait to K O'Brien, 1 wide down leg, Tait must think he's still bowling to lefthanders"
21,"Tait to K O'Brien, 1 wide more of the leg stuff, this one rising a bit more, hopping over O'Brien's bent back"
22,"Tait to K O'Brien, FOUR runs just too short, but straight, and that's played well off the toes through midwicket"
23,"Tait to K O'Brien, no run short, the batsman ducks into it, right into it, and that clatters right into his bat. He didn't flinch"
24,"Tait to K O'Brien, FOUR runs a good shot again, tucked off the toes again and that races again"
25,"McGrath to Morgan, no run left alone outside off"
26,"McGrath to Morgan, OUT very soft, on off stump, and that's outside-edged to first slip. Ireland in complete disarray"
27,"McGrath to White, no run driven into the covers"
28,"McGrath to White, no run stands tall, and that's an inside edge, nearly back on the stumps, but not quite and Gilchrist tidies"
29,"McGrath to White, 1 run pushed into the covers"
30,"Tait to White, no run outside off, some naughty swing threatens to send back yet another Irish player, but he doesn't connect with a loose swish away from his body, his feet stuck in the ground"
31,"Tait to White, 1 wide misdirected sling shot at 90mph (145kph) down off (Warp factor 0.2 for any Klingons out there)"
32,"Tait to White, 1 wide another wide, this one down leg at 91.6mph, which is 145.5kph, warp factor 0.202. 1612.16 inches a second"
33,"Tait to White, no run outside off, and left alone"
34,"Tait to White, no run defended forward tis time"
35,"Tait to White, 1 wide another wide down leg, at 92mph, spot on 148kph"
36,"Tait to White, 1 run"
37,"Tait to K O'Brien, no run dropped! Ponting dives to his right to take a relatively difficult chance at second slip, the ball popping out of his hands as he lands"
38,"Tait to K O'Brien, (no ball) oh dear"
39,"Tait to K O'Brien, 1 wide is Tait being greedy or what? This time he sprays the ball wide down off"
40,"Tait to K O'Brien, 3 runs again drifting on the pads and neatly clipped away through square leg, it pulls up short of the rope"
41,"McGrath to White, 2 runs no sign of any discomfort after being smacked on the cranium in the previous over"
42,"McGrath to White, no run just short of a length, lacking any pace and White is back and across, pushing it out to cover"
43,"McGrath to White, OUT great catch! An excellent slower ball which he misread, spooning it over McGrath's head"
44,"McGrath to Johnston, no run a short bouncer, wild and wooly and down the leg side"
45,"McGrath to Johnston, no run just outside off and he leaves it alone"
46,"McGrath to Johnston, 1 run that'll make him feel better, a firm, crunching late cut down to third man"
47,"Clark to Johnston, no run on middle-and-leg, he's right back in his stumps - practically sitting on his stumps - and defends off the back foot"
48,"Clark to Johnston, no run too short and straight, clipped off his legs but straight to midwicket"
49,"Clark to Johnston, no run ooh luverly yorker from Clark there, on off stump and swinging into the batsman who digs it out with his willow spade"
50,"Clark to Johnston, 1 run easily nudged to leg for a single"
51,"Clark to K O'Brien, no run play and a miss outside off. That kept disconcertingly low on O'Brien who fished at it, missed it and they all go home for tea"
52,"Clark to K O'Brien, no run but a touch of bounce there from Clark, outside off, O'Brien cuts hard but can only find thin air. An almighty heave ho."
53,"McGrath to Johnston, 2 runs solidly, firmly cut off the back foot past point"
54,"McGrath to Johnston, FOUR runs shot! That's a delicious shot, timing a fairly meek delivery on his legs, punching it with pleasing timing past mid-on"
55,"McGrath to Johnston, no run that's more like it from the old man"
56,"McGrath to Johnston, no run shot - but brilliantly fielded by Clarke at backward point. It was savagely cut just to Clarke's right who dived and saved four"
57,"McGrath to Johnston, no run short of a length and left alone"
58,"McGrath to Johnston, 2 runs calmly driven, if a little uppishly, through the covers without really timing it...but neatly placed nevertheless"
59,"Clark to K O'Brien, no run ooh edged but just short of first slip. Some way short of the slips in fact"
60,"Clark to K O'Brien, OUT drifting onto his pads and timed beautifully, with an elegant flick of his wrists, but he picks out Hodge at short midwicket who didn't need move an inch, taking the ball at head height"
61,"Clark to McCallan, 1 run ah, lovely bowling"
62,"Clark to Johnston, FOUR runs too short and it's uppercut down to McGrath at third man - who makes a complete hash of it. He only had a few yards to run to his right, but seemed to give up at the last moment"
63,"Clark to Johnston, no run firmly pushed back to the bowler"
64,"Clark to Johnston, no run excellent ball on middle-and-off and it's defended solidly on the front foot"
65,"Tait to McCallan, no run a roar from Tait, as is his wont, but it's short and wide enough to be left alone with ease"
66,"Tait to McCallan, no run tighter length and a touch fuller, left alone at the last moment"
67,"Tait to McCallan, 2 runs very nicely played, just calmly driving this on the front foot through the infield, past cover, for a couple"
68,"Tait to McCallan, no run flicked off his legs to Hodge who, rather impetuously, shies at the stumps but hits the batsman"
69,"Tait to McCallan, 1 wide an ugly, short, wide, lifting delivery which is easily left alone"
70,"Tait to McCallan, no run oh nearly goddim there. A fearsome ball just outside off, full and fast which is clamped down upon at the very last moment, gets a bottom edge, and the ball very nearly shaves his off stump"
71,"Tait to McCallan, no run but that's much better from McCallan, confidently (ish) forward and defended with a straight bat"
72,"Clark to Johnston, no run pushed easily to cover, but straight to cover"
73,"Clark to Johnston, no run an attempted bouncer? Perhaps not quite short enough to be considered a bouncer, but nevertheless he shies away from it, dropping his hands low"
74,"Clark to Johnston, no run and another one which keeps low, rattling into his pads"
75,"Clark to Johnston, no run ooh close! A play-and-a-miss outside off to a really fine leg-cutter, swinging further away after cutting"
76,"Clark to Johnston, no run onto the front foot and he tries to clobber it but can only clatter it straight into the ground"
77,"Clark to Johnston, 3 runs well played. A full toss worked off his legs, past the diving short midwicket"
78,"Tait to Johnston, 1 wide rubbish. Short, wide and wided by the umpire"
79,"Tait to Johnston, no run much, much better, angling into the batsman and it actually holds its line there. Perhaps the batsman was expecting it to swing, or cut, away, as indicated by his attempt to hammer it off the back foo"
80,"Tait to Johnston, no run my word that was sharp"
81,"Tait to Johnston, OUT but he's got him this time. Clever bowling from Tait, sending it just a touch wider and enticing the drive. Johnston goes for an expansive slap through the covers, but instead the ball slaps into his stu"
82,"Tait to Mooney, 2 runs excellent first nut, on leg stump, but it's squeezed out on the back foot, square of the wicket out into the off side"
83,"Tait to Mooney, no run on off stump, swinging back into the left hander who jumps back to leg, as though shocked by an electric pokery implement, and pushes i to leg"
84,"Tait to Mooney, 3 runs neatly driven down the ground"
85,"Clark to Mooney, no run a classic Clark cutter, and a fine piece of alliteration there from Will, as this little off cutter just moves away from a tentative forward defence from the batsman"
86,"Clark to Mooney, no run ever-so-slightly shorter, allowing him just a fraction more time to read the length and it's left alone. Wisely. Like an owl."
87,"Clark to Mooney, no run a nothing delivery, really, too wide of the off stump to threaten the batsman"
88,"Clark to Mooney, no run short and wide, once again, and left alone"
89,"Clark to Mooney, no run short, rising onto the left hander who punches it off the back foot to cover"
90,"Clark to Mooney, no run forward on the front foot, if not quite to the pitch of the ball, and it's sliced to point"
91,"Tait to McCallan, no run ooh that was quick. 92 mph, but looked faster, and swinging into the batsman who dug it out"
92,"Tait to McCallan, 1 run nicely clunked to extra cover, and they set off for a single"
93,"Tait to Mooney, 3 wide well that's vicious, if wooly - not to mention wild. Short, and he ducks underneath it"
94,"Tait to Mooney, no run much better"
95,"Tait to Mooney, 2 runs terrific stop from Symonds at extra cover saves four. Mooney just pushed at it, seemingly without any power, but such is Tait's pace that it fairly sped off the bat"
96,"Tait to Mooney, FOUR runs shot! That's what he was attempting the previous delivery, driving this on the up past Symonds this time. Fabulous shot"
97,"Tait to Mooney, 1 run pushed out off the back foot and he screams through for a single"
98,"Hogg to Mooney, no run on off stump, he tries to paddle it but misses"
99,"Hogg to Mooney, no run nearly! On middle-and-off, he came forward meekly and tried to defend it but the spin of the ball almost saw it wobble into his stumps"
100,"Hogg to Mooney, 1 run pushed out to cover for a single"
101,"Hogg to McCallan, no run smothered by the batsman on the front foot"
102,"Hogg to McCallan, no run the wrong'un which is misread by the batsman who plays and misses outside off"
103,"Hogg to McCallan, 1 run swept just behind square"
104,"Symonds to McCallan, no run here comes Symonds, chugging in, and it's defended on the front foot"
105,"Symonds to McCallan, no run good length, if slightly wide, and it's defended out to cover"
106,"Symonds to McCallan, no run too straight but he can't make anything of it, nudging it to leg and straight to midwicket"
107,"Symonds to McCallan, no run just a little too wide, but it's a good length from Symonds here, not allowing the batsman to drive"
108,"Symonds to McCallan, no run but he does drive this time, though it's a little short to be doing so and it's aerially clubbed to cover"
109,"Symonds to McCallan, OUT gone this time. McCallan was getting fed up with all this poking and prodding"
110,"Hogg to D Langford-Smith, no run turning back into the right hander who defends off the back foot"
111,"Hogg to D Langford-Smith, 1 run on leg stump, turned to short fine leg. Oh dear, it's Symonds there and they take him on - with a single, not in terms of asking him for a fight or anything - but his throw is wide"
112,"Hogg to Mooney, no run big shout by Gilchrist to one he padded away"
113,"Hogg to Mooney, 1 run pushed out to cover on the front foot"
114,"Hogg to D Langford-Smith, no run on off stump and pushed calmly back to the bowler"

116,"Symonds to Mooney, 1 run ooh nicely bowled, shaping back into the batsman but he played it quite competently"
117,"Symonds to D Langford-Smith, no run very well bowled - a fuller length this time which is defended, or rather dug out"
118,"Symonds to D Langford-Smith, 1 run edged, but it doesn't carry, falling just short of the colossus that is Hayden at first slip"
119,"Symonds to Mooney, no run crashed into the covers but he can't bisect it"
120,"Symonds to Mooney, no run a play and a miss outside off - well bowled"
121,"Symonds to Mooney, FOUR runs and he does get an edge this time, but it's wide of the lone slip"
122,"Hogg to D Langford-Smith, OUT Dave's gone! Stepping back, not picking it at all, he tries to defend but it takes the outside edge, ballooning to Ricky Ponting at silly point"
123,"Hogg to Rankin, no run huge appeal - a quicker one which raps him on the pad. And that looks absolutely dead, but Rudi doesn't like it"
124,"Hogg to Rankin, no run forward come Rankin, playing it with impressively soft hands (perhaps I'm being overly generous there), to one just falling short of slip"
125,"Hogg to Rankin, no run solidly defended this time"
126,"Hogg to Rankin, 1 wide drifting down the leg side"
127,"Hogg to Rankin, no run terrific ball, the wrong'un, not picked by Rankin who plays and misses"
128,"Hogg to Rankin, no run pushed out to leg"
129,"Symonds to Mooney, 1 run firmly punched on the front foot, square of the wicket"
130,"Symonds to Rankin, no run and it's left alone outside off. Just a hint of away movement there"
131,"Symonds to Rankin, no run just a bit of wobble back into the left hander who is cautiously forward, poking it out to cover"

140,"McGrath to White, no run patted back to McGrath who ambles down the track to field, before turning and lolloping back to his mark"

179,"Hogg to Mooney, no run pushed onto the back foot"
180,"Hogg to Mooney, no run Rudi Koertzen's a kidder. That one's curved past the outside edge, Gilchrist thinks it's out and the umpire shapes to give it so, but decides he's just moving his left arm. Gilchrist can't believe it"
