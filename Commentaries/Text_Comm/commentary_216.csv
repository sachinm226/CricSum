106,"Starc to Mendis, no run more movement but this one has started too wide, moves on further outside off and Mendis is comfortable in leaving"
107,"Starc to Mendis, FOUR runs short and wide, too much width. The length was also different. Much shorter and so Kusal goes after the upper cut. Gets it off the outside edge and it races away to the third man boundary"

109,"Starc to Mendis, no run nice end. Full and straight, blocked under his eyes"
110,"Zampa to Upul Tharanga, 1 run flight, too much of it, a full toss is drilled to long-on for one"
111,"Zampa to Mendis, SIX runs yikes, tripe. Mendis doesn't care. A filthy full toss on middle, Kusal, like he did in the Test here a few weeks ago, puts it away over the square leg fence. Wears a wide grin"
112,"Zampa to Mendis, 1 run another rank long-hop on off, Mendis rocks back and puts it away to deep midwicket."

122,"Boland to Mendis, no run good length delivery outside off, craved out to point, who fires a completely unnecessary throw at the non-strikers end. Maybe an attempt to scuff up the ball"

131,"Hastings to Mendis, no run back of a length on middle, worked away to midwicket. Hitting a hard length is Hastings"
132,"Hastings to Mendis, FOUR runs smashes it over mid-off. What a shot that is. A tad too full outside off, Mendis opens up the bat face and drills the drive over long-off. The length was there to play that shot."
133,"Hastings to Mendis, 1 run back of a length on off, shovelled to midwicket. Use of that bottom hand. Superb batting"

219,"Faulkner to Perera, no run right towards the off stump now, Dilruwan blocks with a straight bat"
220,"Zampa to Pathirana, FOUR runs just clears mid-off! He came down the ground and didn't middle the full toss at all, chipping it just over Starc running backwards. Starc even put in a slide near the boundary to keep the ball in but the third umpire wants to be sure. Looks like he was in contact with the ball and rope at the same time, according to the third umpire"
221,"Zampa to Pathirana, FOUR runs middles it this time for four more! Danced down the track and smacked the full toss straight down the ground"

229,"Starc to Pathirana, 1 run angling into the batsman again, he works it off the hips towards long leg"
230,"Starc to Perera, OUT the angle does it again, off stump knocked over! That one zipped through the defence as Dilruwan looked to defend it in front of off, the ball nipped in sharply from outside off and beat the outside edge to hit the stump"
231,"Starc to Lakmal, OUT that's a yorker at 147kmh and whams into the middle stump! The angle, the speed, the length...all come together to push Lakmal on the back foot, he tries to block the ball but it beats him completely to disturb the bottom of middle stump"
232,"Starc to Aponso, no run Aponso gets a quick delivery too towards the off stump, just back of length and not a yorker, he covers his stumps and defends a solidly to draw a cheer from the crowd"
233,"Boland to Pathirana, no run offers some width outside off, Pathirana swings big outside off and finds short cover"
234,"Boland to Pathirana, no run bangs it in shorter around off now, he stays back to defend it"
235,"Boland to Pathirana, no run gives some room on the off side with the angle, Pathirana cuts it late but the point fielder goes to his right to stop it"
236,"Boland to Pathirana, FOUR runs that's a Sanga-style drive over the covers - get some width and unleash an elegant swing by going down on a knee. Khawaja chased and put in a dive but the ball beat him"

241,"Starc to Pathirana, no run in the block hole on middle stump now, he digs it out to the leg side"
242,"Starc to Pathirana, (no ball) FOUR runs is the ball wet? That was a swinging beamer towards the chest around off stump, and Pathirana adjusts very well to go down a bit and guide that fine on the off side for four. That's a no ball"
243,"Starc to Pathirana, no run in the block hole now outside off, he steers it to third man but they don't run"

246,"Boland to Pathirana, no run length delivery to target the stumps, he defends with a straight bat"
247,"Boland to Pathirana, OUT can't clear mid-off and SL are bowled out for 195! Pitched up, he lofts the ball on the off side but doesn't get enough and Faulkner takes a couple of steps back to catch that easily"
248,"5.32pm Sri Lanka must be distraught with their efoorts here. De Silva and Gunathilaka didn't give Starc a wicket in the opening spell and started picking boundaries too in their half-century stand but once Faulkner broke the stand, wickets kept tumbling and lack of partnerships led to their downfall. No batsman reached the forties as all bowlers except Zampa kept the scoring rate under check, picked wickets (which Zampa did too) and SL never"
249,"Welcome back to the chase. An all too familiar story for Sri Lanka, but can their spinners set up something? Either way this ain't going to be a 50-overs innings. The drizzle before the break won't really help them either. Warner and Wade, Finch isn't fit enough to open. Wade has opened in ODI cricket before, I think. Seam to start, Suranga Lakmal."
250,"Lakmal to Warner, 1 run ooh, lots of movement to start. Good length on middle, the ball darts back prodigiously. Inside edge to fine leg for a run"
251,"Lakmal to Wade, no run full and wide outside off, 131 kph. Nicely driven to cover off the back foot"
252,"Lakmal to Wade, no run good length outside off, some inward movement. Blocked"

260,"Perera to Warner, no run this one is the slider. Full and straight, quick. Driven to cover. No turn this time"

266,"Lakmal to Wade, no run full and straight, inward movement. Hit back to the bowler"
267,"Lakmal to Wade, 1 run back of a length outside off, Wade stands tall and punches to mid-off. Despite him being deep in the crease, he still gets one"

269,"Perera to Wade, no run quick outside off, skids on with the arm. Wade comes down but pads it away into the leg side"

272,"Perera to Warner, no run overpitched, quick. Hastily driven to mid-on"
273,"Perera to Warner, 1 run back of a length on off, Warner goes back and punches to long-off"
274,"Lakmal to Warner, no run short and wide, too much width but extracts some extra bounce too which is responsible for the ball going over Warner's flaying bat"
275,"Lakmal to Warner, 2 runs squirted away over point. Full and wide outside off, Warner goes after it. The ball skews off the outside half, over point. Third man gets around"

284,"Perera to Bailey, 1 run flat on leg, worked to midwicket to get off and running"

288,"Lakmal to Bailey, 1 run back of a length on leg, Bailey nurdles one into the leg side for a run"
289,"Lakmal to Warner, no run wafts and the ball goes past! Not a good shot. Good length outside off, the ball moves away and beats the bat. No feet movement"

329,"Pathirana to Warner, no run big appeal, no says umpire Dar. Tossed up outside off, Warner gets low and tries to sweep, straight to leg slip. Was there some glove there? Mighty close to it, may have been the top edge in fact. Sri Lanka do not review."
