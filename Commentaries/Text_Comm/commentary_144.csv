0,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run shortish and outside off, Williamson drags it across to the man at deep square leg with a pull. That single also brings up the fifty partnership"
1,"Faulkner to Guptill, no run off-pace delivery again and Guptill doesn't read it. Lovely deception. Pitches it on a good length and manages to get a little more bounce than the batsman expects, to hit him on the thigh"
2,"Faulkner to Guptill, 1 run fuller delivery outside off, drives it past mid-on's left"
3,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run moves across onto off stump to glance a shortish delivery on middle to long leg"
4,"Faulkner to Guptill, no run good length ball on off stump, defends to mdiwicket"
5,"Cummins to Williamson, 1 run glides a back of a length delivery to deep third man. Uses all the 142 kph pace to his own benefit"
6,"Cummins to Guptill, no run opens the face at the last second to try and beat the man at point, but this 146 kph delivery doesn't let him do so"
7,"Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs lifts it over the wicketkeeper! This is purely intentional. This is absolutely brilliant. In the idea at least, if not the execution. Guptill knows Cummins is giving him so much pace than he knows what to do with, and so the moment it is pitched short, even if it is on middle, he swerves his torso back and ramps it"
8,"Cummins to Guptill, no run bangs it into middle of the deck and gives the batsman an easy sighter. Bouncer avoided"
9,"Cummins to Guptill, 1 run 121 kph, that's the slower ball, full on off stump, Guptill picks it, blocks it into the cover point region for a single"
10,"Cummins to Williamson, no run back of a length and just outside off, defends"
11,"Faulkner to Guptill, 1 leg bye angles it into the pads and Guptill is unable to do what he wants to, tickle it past the left of short fine leg, which would have been a boundary"
12,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run good length ball outside off, Williamson directs it off the open face to deep third man"
13,"Faulkner to Guptill, no run oh, misses out again. And this is a poorer ball than earlier in the over because the line is way down leg. Guptill manages to get bat, but the flick shot picks out short fine leg - the only man there"
14,"Faulkner to Guptill, FOUR runs full and wide outside off, and Guptill is able to pick the gap between point and short third man. He was originally intending to glide it, but seeing as the delivery didn't have much pace but gave him all the room he needed to free his arms, he hit it a lot harder"
15,"Faulkner to Guptill, 1 run defends towards point, with soft hands, and sneaks a single"
16,"Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run gets on top of the bounce of this shortish delivery on off stump and whips it through midwicket"
17,"Stoinis to Williamson, no run pretty full and outside off, Williamson leans back, plays very, very late and ends up chopping the ball behind to the keeper"
18,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run good length and angled in at off stump, uses his wrists and manoeuvres the ball to square leg"
19,"Stoinis to Guptill, 1 run back of a length and on off stump, Guptill hangs back and chops a cheeky single to the right of Handscomb behind the stumps"
20,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run just short of a good length and outside off, leans back, gently punches in front of point and sets off to the other end"
21,"Stoinis to Guptill, 1 run rising short ball outside off, Guptill rises with it and blunts the ball to cover"
22,"Stoinis to Williamson, OUT bat-pad catch to backward point running to his left. Big appeal from Stoinis and the keeper. Umpire Knights' finger goes up. Stoinis snaffles Williamson in his first over. Back of a length and angled in at off stump, kicks up, Williamson jumps off the ground and seeks to work the ball to the leg side. The ball grazes the inside edge, then the thigh pad, and pops up to Maxwell. Williamson is Stonis' maiden one-day international victim. How ab"
23,"Starc to Guptill, no run full and outside off, pushed down to mid-off"
24,"Starc to Guptill, no run wide yorker, squeezed out"

28,"Starc to Taylor, no run pitched up and slanting away outside off, left alone"
29,"Stoinis to Guptill, 1 run back of a length and outside off, Guptill runs it down to third man. He raises his bat and acknowledges his half-century, taking in the applause from the home crowd."
30,"Stoinis to Taylor, 5 wide Stoinis runs in hard, hits the deck hard, this one absolutely flies off the surface, and beats a leaping Handscomb. Tough day behind the stumps. Taylor avoided it. Five wides it is"
31,"Stoinis to Taylor, 1 run length and outside off, Taylor simply taps it down to third man"
32,"Stoinis to Guptill, 1 run tip-and-run single to the left of the keeper"
33,"Stoinis to Taylor, 2 runs excellent placement and running to boot from Taylor. Fullish and on off, Taylor, with a more pronounced side-on stance, simply dabs it in the gap at square leg"
34,"Stoinis to Taylor, no run nice and full outside off, Taylor flows forward and drives through the line. Hits crisply but can't beat mid-off now"
35,"Stoinis to Taylor, no run back of a length and outside off, jabbed to point and that's drinks"
36,"Starc to Guptill, no run back of a length, bounces at Guptill, 140ks, catches him in an awkward tangle"
37,"Starc to Guptill, no run short on leg stump, 139.6ks, tucks 'em up for room. Guptill fends it back to Starc"
38,"Starc to Guptill, 1 run just short of a good length and speared wide outside off, Guptill flat-bats a cut to sweeper"

40,"Starc to Taylor, no run very full and on a set of stumps outside off, Taylor does not bother going after it"

44,"Stoinis to Taylor, no run full and outside off, presses forward, meets the pitch and drives the ball to short cover"

46,"Stoinis to Guptill, 2 runs short of a length and outside off, Guptill gets up on his tippy toes and plays a jabbing punch square through the off side"
47,"Stoinis to Guptill, no run back of a length and sort of skids through outside off, Guptill is stapled to the crease as he swishes and only connects with thin air"
48,"Head to Taylor, 1 run full and slow on off stump, Taylor shuffles across off, goes low, and paddles to long leg"
49,"Head to Guptill, 1 wide quick fizzer down leg, left alone"
50,"Head to Guptill, no run straight ball on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
51,"Head to Guptill, 4 byes Handscomb's day gets tougher. He is nutmegged. Guptill pre-meditates shuffling outside leg stump for a scoop to the left of the keeper. Guptill is beaten, as is the keeper, as the ball goes through his legs"
52,"Head to Guptill, 1 run pretty full and slid across off stump, Guptill edges it, the ball grazes the pad of Handscomb and streaks away down towards third man"

55,"Head to Taylor, 1 run paddled down towards long leg"
56,"Stoinis to Taylor, no run short and wide outside off, thumps a cut to the left of Maxwell. He spins around, aims at the striker's end, and misses. Taylor was off for a single, a direct hit could have dismissed Taylor"

58,"Stoinis to Guptill, no run just short of a good length on middle, fended back to the bowler"

60,"Stoinis to Taylor, 1 run Taylor takes Maxwell's arm on for the third time in six balls. Tips it to point and scampers across. Maxwell still can't connect with a direct hit. This time he misses at the striker's end"

66,"Head to Guptill, no run pitched up on off, driven to mid-off, who is inside the circle"

71,"Stoinis to Taylor, no run full and outside off, whipped away on the front foot to straight midwicket"

74,"Head to Taylor, 1 run fired on leg or just outside leg, swept to long leg"
75,"Head to Guptill, 1 run full on middle, not much turn, push-driven to long-on"
76,"Head to Taylor, OUT too full for the sweep and Taylor drags it back onto the stumps. Tossed up and angling across off, wide outside off, Taylor goes low and makes a mess of the sweep. Head reaps reward for some tight bowling"

82,"Stoinis to Guptill, no run full and angled in on off, punched to cover on the front foot"
83,"Stoinis to Guptill, OUT bowled'em. Stoinis has nabbed both Williamson and Guptill. Sneaks through the gate. Half-volley length, bowled from wide of the crease, right up there to be laced through the covers. Guptill attempts a drive, but the ball cuts back in slightly and goes through the defences.

84,"Stoinis to Munro, 1 run full on the pads, whipped away through deep square leg"

89,"Head to Munro, no run full and on off, dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch. Pushed to mid-on off the inside half"
90,"Head to Munro, no run Handscomb drops another catch. Shorter offbreak from Head, spins away from the left-hander. He goes back for a cut, outside-edges it behind, the ball clangs off the gloves"
91,"Head to Munro, 1 run tossed on middle, driven on the front foot to long-on"
92,"Stoinis to Munro, OUT length and outside off, Munro shovels it in the air off the inside half and hands a loopy catch to Finch. Not a full-blooded hit from the left-hander. He aimed to clear mid-on, instead chipped it to Australia's captain. So Handscomb's drop costs Australia just one run"
93,"Stoinis to Neesham, no run left alone outside off"
94,"Stoinis to Neesham, 1 run leg-side delivery, glided down to long leg"
95,"Stoinis to Broom, no run offcutter, comes in, beats the inside edge and clatters into the back thigh"

111,"Cummins to Neesham, 1 run short of a length and outside off, dabbed down to wide slip"
112,"Cummins to Broom, 1 run back of a length on off, hops and nurdles a single in front of midwicket"
113,"Cummins to Neesham, FOUR runs 142.5ks short ball outside off, Neesham is beaten for pace. He is rushed into a hook and ends up top-edging the ball over the keeper's head. Evades long leg sliding to his right. One-bounce four"
114,"Cummins to Neesham, no run bouncer, ducks under it"
115,"Cummins to Neesham, FOUR runs short of a length and slanting away outside off, Neesham has a waft away from the body. The ball grazes the inside edge and rolls away past the stumps fine on the leg side. French-cut away"

120,"Stoinis to Neesham, no run short of a length and outside off, chopped away to the right of Maxwell at backward point"
121,"Stoinis to Neesham, 1 run leg-stump delivery, which is easily glanced to long leg"
122,"Cummins to Neesham, 1 run Marsh drops it at wide slip diving across to his right. Went with one hand, the ball popped out of it. Full and angling across off, Neesham wafts with his feet stapled to the crease and gets away. Marsh was late onto it"
123,"Cummins to Broom, no run"

133,"Stoinis to Neesham, 2 runs back of a length on middle and leg, hangs back and whips through midwicket for two. Excellent running. End of an uninterrupted spell from Stoinis: 10-0-49-3. And that's drinks at Eden Park"
134,"Faulkner to Broom, FOUR runs well, that bodes well for New Zealand, moving into the final stage of the innings. Broom waits on a shortish delivery outside off, letting it come on and then chops down on it. Late cut past deep third man's right"
135,"Faulkner to Broom, 1 run squares him up with the angle from over the wicket as a back of a length ball pitches on leg stump and decks away off the seam. Broom, intending to work the ball to midwicket, gets a leading edge past point"
136,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run into the pads and Neesham, trying to glance it fine, doesn't get any bat on it. Could have easily been a boundary with fine leg up"
137,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run strikes him in the box, or close to, I think. A little bit of seam movement into the left-hander, who is surprised by the movement, the ball beating his inside edge and pinning him"
138,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run shortish and outside off, Neesham looks for a cut, but plays the shot under the ball. No footwork"
139,"Faulkner to Neesham, 1 run length ball outside off, flat-batted through the covers. That's the back of the hand slower ball, bringing up the fifty-partnership. And they've got there in 49 balls"
140,"Hazlewood to Neesham, no run cramps him up with a 132 kph delivery on off stump, Neesham goes for the pull, but is perhaps into the shot just a touch late. Inside edge onto his thigh"

142,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run tries to work a good length ball on off stump through the leg side, but finds midwicket"

150,"Faulkner to Broom, 1 run fuller ball outside off, drives through to the man sweeping on the off side boundary"
151,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run flashes outside off, but without proper footwork he has no hope of making connection. Good slower ball from Faulkner again"
152,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run digs it in short, Broom goes for a pull and Hazlewood barely even asks for a caught behind appeal, but the umpire Palliyaguruge says sure, why not? The batsman goes for a review straight away though and with nothing on both HotSpot and Snicko, the on-field decision is overruled. Take nothing away from the ball though, climbed up towards Broom's left shoulder, cramping him up and preventing him from making good, or any, connection"

154,"Hazlewood to Neesham, no run shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
155,"Hazlewood to Neesham, FOUR runs nails the pull, hit so far in front of square that it should deflate a fast bowler. Hazlewood tries to go short again, but this time it didn't quite rise up high enough. Neesham takes it from outside off and swings it past midwicket"
156,"Hazlewood to Neesham, FOUR runs flat-batted over mid-on! Gets the length to go up and over with a straight bat and he doesn't waste it"
157,"Hazlewood to Neesham, 1 run works it into the leg side, behind square"

160,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run invites the drive and gets it as Neesham finds cover again"

162,"Faulkner to Broom, 1 run gets up on his toes and flicks a short delivery off his hip towards short fine leg"
163,"Faulkner to Neesham, no run rather a bit full to be attempting a cut shot, and again Neesham is beaten. Faulkner's seen this almost every over since coming back to bowl in his second spell and he has his hands on his hips, not amused at his luck"
164,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run attempts to clip a shortish delivery into the leg side, but takes it high on the pad instead"
165,"Hazlewood to Broom, SIX runs rushes down the track and hammers it onto the sightscreen. Takes till the 38th over for the first six on a ground where the straight boundary is about 60 m. Top shot from Broom though, changing a length ball into an overpitched one with his footwork. Actually damages the sightscreen electronics"
166,"Hazlewood to Broom, 1 run opens the face and runs a short of a length delivery past backward point"
167,"Hazlewood to Neesham, 2 runs stays deep in his crease to hatchet a short delivery on middle and up and over the leg side infield to long-on"
168,"Hazlewood to Neesham, no run length ball outside off, defends to point"
169,"Hazlewood to Neesham, OUT top edge as he pulls and deep midwicket takes a simple catch. Excellent time for a wicket and it comes from their Mr Dependable. Simple, back of a length, not much room to free the arms. Neesham tries to make a bit too much of it and mistimes his shot. Head steadies himself a few yards inside the fence and takes it well"
170,"Starc to Broom, no run full on middle and leg, turns it to midwicket"
171,"Starc to Broom, 1 run guides it to sweeper cover"

182,"Hazlewood to Santner, no run back of a length on middle and leg, keeps it out"
183,"Starc to Broom, FOUR runs gets his fifty with a phenomenal extra cover drive. It's length. He sees he can get under it. And he pummels it over the top. Eden Park roars"
184,"Starc to Broom, no run slings down a yorker at 146 kph, from wide of the crease, and Broom digs it out to point"
185,"Starc to Broom, no run another yorker, angled sharply into the leg stump. Broom falls over as he tries to flick and is hit on the pads. Shouldn't be out lbw, the umpire doesn't give it, but Australia review. There's no bat, and on impact, middle and off stump are visible, an indication that it would miss the leg. HawkEye confirms"
186,"Starc to Broom, SIX runs has he taken it? Hazlewood leaps in the air, right on the edge of the boundary at third man, and comes up with a one-hander. So cool. So calm. Tracking it all the way. Such a super effort. But is his foot on the line? He isn't entirely happy with the effort, so that's an indicator that he felt the advertising skirting on his boot. The short boundaries at Eden Park comes to Broom's rescue and his upper cut to a short ball wide outside off comes"
187,"Starc to Broom, 1 wide spears a 145 kph delivery down the leg side, Broom tries to get his bat on it with a flick but he has no chance"

191,"Cummins to Santner, OUT what a shot, but oh, there's a fielder there, it's Maxwell, and its a stunning catch! Flashes a little grin after running several yards to his right, eyes always on the ball, taking it cleanly as he bends low and then gets into a military-style roll with the momentum he had going. Top effort. And one of the few times Santner times the ball, and he did so well to back away to make his own room against a good short ball"
192,"Cummins to Broom, 1 run guides a shortish delivery to deep third man"
193,"Cummins to Southee, 4 byes oopsy, the stand-in keeper mucks up. It's the slower ball outside off, Broom tries the dab to third man, but comes up with nothing. The ball bounces before it reaches Handscomb and spins away to his left"
194,"Cummins to Southee, OUT backs away and goes for the upper cut and he hasn't got enough on it. Third man comes up off the boundary, steadies himself and takes a good catch. Faulkner the man there"
195,"Cummins to Broom, 1 run and he does so, dabbing a back of a length delivery to deep third man"
196,"Starc to Broom, no run starts around the wicket and beats Broom, who is trying to late cut a back of a length slower ball which cramps him for room"
197,"Starc to Broom, 2 runs guides it behind point for a couple of runs"

203,"Hazlewood to Broom, 1 run pulls, but can only get a single for it because Hazlewood hasn't given any room for Broom to work with"
204,"Hazlewood to Santner, no run swats a bouncer, coming up past his chest, to short midwicket"
205,"Hazlewood to Santner, 1 run belts a full delivery just outside off to a deepish mid-off"
206,"Hazlewood to Broom, 1 run lets the short ball come onto him and deflects it behind square leg"
207,"Hazlewood to Santner, no run pushes him back with one coming up to his chest, on leg stump, so the only option for Santner is to bunt it down the pitch. Intelligent cricket from Hazlewood, forcing the batsman into awkward positions when all he is thinking about is hitting the ball hard"
208,"Starc to Broom, 1 wide full and quite a distance outside off, Broom can collect the extra"
209,"Starc to Broom, FOUR runs lashes it over extra cover. He's playing a gem of an innings, but at this point it is unsure whether it will be enough. Gets length, thrashes length"
210,"Starc to Broom, no run digs out a yorker to point"
211,"Starc to Broom, no run beaten for pace as a 145 kph delivery, a wide yorker, skips past the flashing blade"
212,"Starc to Broom, 1 leg bye slings a full delivery into the pads and Broom is struck on the toe at full pace, he's floored too, but has enough of his faculties to take a leg bye. Outstanding yorker bowler, this fellow, and this angle from around the wicket, wide of the crease, with that slingy arm action makes it all the more difficult"
213,"Starc to Ferguson, no run 145 kph, full and straight at the stumps, Ferguson manages to keep it out"
214,"Starc to Ferguson, no run low full toss, pushes it to deep point. Broom says no on the single to keep the strike"
215,"Cummins to Broom, no run good bowling. that's the slower ball, dug into the middle of the deck, biting into it and cutting into the right-hander. Broom goes for a cut, lets out a loud grunt too by evidence of the stump mics, and is beaten"
216,"Cummins to Broom, SIX runs too straight, too easy to be picked up. Broom clears his front leg and heaves it over the long leg boundary, well to the left of the man in the deep"
217,"Cummins to Broom, 1 run reaches out in front of him, over his shoulder, to drag a short ball from outside off to deep midwicket"
218,"Cummins to Ferguson, no run bouncer, aims it at Ferguson's left ear, avoids it. The square leg umpire Wayne Knights originally intended to signal wide, but then changed his mind. Good bowling, although Eden Park boos at the lack of a wide"
219,"Cummins to Ferguson, 1 run shortish and outside off, slashed behind point"
220,"Cummins to Broom, 1 run backs away and cuts a short delivery on off stump to deep point. Keep the strike with two overs to go"
221,"Starc to Broom, 1 run carves a full and wide delivery to deep point"
222,"Starc to Santner, 1 run good length on off stump, Santner taps and runs to cover. Excellent single, and Broom showing the requisite desperation with a big dive to beat a direct hit from jersey number 9. Possibly Heazlett?"
223,"Starc to Broom, 1 run spins on his back foot to pull a short ball from outside off to deep midwicket"
224,"Starc to Santner, 1 run backs away from a full delivery on leg stump and drills it to long-on"

226,"Starc to Broom, no run full and just outside off, as Starc moves around the wicket to cut the angle, Broom steers it to point"
227,"Hazlewood to Santner, 1 run moves leg side, he is preempting the short-ball tactic from Hazlewood, and punches the ball through cover"
228,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run that's a ripper. At 136 kph, it hits the deck just outside off and surprises a set batsman with extra bounce. Broom is thinking about a glide to third man, but the ball soars over his gloves"
229,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run another shortish delivery outside off and Broom, while trying to tap it to third man, refuses to go through with the shot. Worried about losing his wicket here"
230,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run covers the line of a back of a length delivery on off stump and blocks. Cross-seamer that"
231,"Hazlewood to Broom, no run that's another cross-seamer, pitched up, asking the drive. Broom goes for it, walking into the shot, aiming at the covers. He is beaten"
232,"Hazlewood to Broom, 1 run gets down low with a full delivery outside off and runs it to third man. That's the end of Hazlewood, with six overs to go."
233,"Faulkner to Broom, no run that's the back of the hand slower ball, from over the wicket, Broom wanders outside off to try and scoop it to the long leg boundary but misses it completely"
234,"Faulkner to Broom, 1 run another slower ball, this one full and outside off, drills it to cover"
235,"Faulkner to Ferguson, 1 run 106kph, change of pace, at a full length and outside off, Ferguson skews it to short third man"
236,"Faulkner to Broom, OUT comes down the track and hoists a back of the hand slower ball on leg stump to long-on. End of a fine innings from Broom, who has basically had to fight all on his lonesome all through the middle overs"
237,"Faulkner to Boult, no run pokes at a slower ball but fails to make contact"
238,"Faulkner to Boult, 1 run full toss outside off, slaps it to long-on"
239,"Cummins to Boult, SIX runs these two were there two years ago, but it was Williamson who hit Cummins for six to win the game. Here Boult gets his piece, backing away and carving the bouncer over the third man boundary"
240,"Cummins to Boult, 1 run off the splice to mid-off, as the short ball angled into the body is met with a full-on swipe. Looking to square leg, but beaten soundly for pace"
241,"Cummins to Ferguson, 1 run dabs a shortish delivery into the covers"
242,"Cummins to Boult, FOUR runs hammers it over straight midwicket. Right off the middle, and his tactic to run away to the leg side and make his own room while Cummins is trying to cramp him works superbly"
243,"Cummins to Boult, no run lands a yorker, which meanders down the leg side. The umpire gives the bowler a little bit of leeway with Boult having made a move back and well outside off"
244,"Cummins to Boult, FOUR runs finishes the innings in style, the back foot is camped deep in the crease, the front foot is nowhere to be found as Boult belts a length delivery outside off to the long-off boundary. Timely cameo from the No. 11"
245,"Australia wouldn't entirely be fazed by this target, they've got power-hitters aplenty, but with a couple of new faces in their middle order and their captain for the tour Matthew Wade out injured, you just can't be sure. Not much should sour the mood of Marcus Stoinis though, he picked up Kane Williamson as his first ODI wicket, followed it up by removing Martin Guptill for 61 and eventually finished with 10-0-49-3. Join us in about half an hour for the resumption."
246,"2.48 pm New Zealand did not look like they would be getting 286 when they were 134 for 5. But Neil Broom, in his second coming as an international cricketer, played another outstanding innings. His third ODI fifty was well paced, and notable in perhaps the shots he chose not to play as much as those he did. It was on his 73 that New Zealand have built this total on."
247,"3.15 pm The huddle's been dispensed with. Eden Park welcomes their team with warm applause, and into it stride Australia's openers, Travis Head and his captain for the day Aaron Finch"

267,"Boult to Marsh, 1 run nudged to the left of Santner at short midwicket. Marsh sets off for a single. A direct hit from Santner could have had Head"

273,"Southee to Marsh, no run good length and slanting away outside off, dabbed to cover"
274,"Southee to Marsh, 1 run full and angling away outside off, opens the face and dinks the ball wide enough of wide slip. Played down to third man"

282,"Boult to Marsh, no run back of a length and kicks away outside off, beats the attempted cut"
283,"Southee to Handscomb, OUT there's a clicking sound as the stand-in keeper Latham gloves the ball. Umpire Knight shakes his head. NZ challenge the on-field not-out decision. Cross-seamer from Southee. Handsomb simply prods at it away from the body, and nicks it behind. Hotspot detects a white blotch and nicko detects a spike as the ball passes the bat. Handscomb has to go. Umpire Knight reverses his call, raises his finger, and sends back Handscomb"
284,"Southee to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell is greeted by a short ball, angled in on off, pulls and gets enough bat on it to send the ball away fine on the leg side past the diving keeper"
285,"Southee to Maxwell, no run"
286,"Southee to Maxwell, 1 run full and outside off, guided through backward point"

412,"Neesham to Faulkner, no run comes down the track, that big backlift going high, but Neesham follows Faulkner, cramping him for room and getting the ball to come up towards his stomach. Can only slice to point"
