28,"Kane Richardson to Mendis, OUT picks out the man at deep square! Couldn't have found him any better. A short ball from Richardson, Mendis strikes it nicely but straight down McDermott's throat. Mendis is furious. Richardson has his first wicket of the series"

67,"Cummins to Perera, no run short of a length at the stumps, backs away and cuts straight to point"
68,"Cummins to Perera, 2 runs slower short ball, slammed in at an off stump line. Creates room by walking into the leg side and looks to pull this. Can only slice to midwicket's left"
69,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run top edge falls safely in the square leg region. Bouncer gets steep as he looks to hook and takes his eyes off the ball. Was looking to check that shot or even evade by the time it got up in his face"

71,"Cummins to Perera, 1 run short and just outside off, pulled into the turf towards deep square"

86,"Kane Richardson to Fernando, OUT guided straight to the keeper it seems. But he reviews after being given caught behind. Short of a length and climbing up outside off.

88,"Kane Richardson to Jayasuriya, 1 run short of a length at the hips. Shovels this to deep square's right and McDermott completely fluffs the throw and has Warner ducking for cover at midwicket as it trickles harmlessly towards the middle of the pitch"
89,"Kane Richardson to Perera, 3 runs sjhort of a length and spanked on the rise to sweeper's left. Looks like Starc there who runs a long way and flings this back in inches from the boundary to save one"
90,"Kane Richardson to Jayasuriya, 1 run length ball just outside off, backs away and looks to scythe it. Comes off the inside half and ends up at mid-off"
91,"Agar to Jayasuriya, 1 run length on leg stump, flicked to deep mdiwicket"

107,"Zampa to Rajapaksa, no run length ball pushed across off stump. Looks to chop that and is beaten. Carey has the bails off meanwhile as the batsman tries to maintain balance on the back foot. The foot rises - Carey waits for it to rise - but is on the floor as he takes the bails off. Not out"
108,"Zampa to Rajapaksa, 2 runs length on middle stump, pushed towards long-on with soft hands. His direct hit deflects into the covers where they'll find an extra run"
109,"Starc to Jayasuriya, 1 run slower length ball on off stump. Leans in and tucks this behind square with a closed face"
110,"Starc to Rajapaksa, SIX runs launched over deep backward square! Overpitched and on the pads. At his pace, the batsman need only get connection on the whip. And he does"

114,"Starc to Jayasuriya, OUT loses leg stump. Full ball headed into leg stump, the same kind that was lifted for a six earlier. Jayasuriya though has looked for a reverse ramp, while standing on his feet. No way he's going to pull that off from there"

118,"Kane Richardson to Rajapaksa, 1 leg bye slower short ball into the body. Looks for the slog but cops that on the body"

120,"Kane Richardson to Malinga, 1 run full at middle and leg. Looks to drive and gets a thick inside edge onto boot"
121,"8:43pm Sri Lanka finally get to a serviceable score. They lost their openers in the Powerplay and hopes of an acceleration seemed as dim as the last two games. But that partnership for the third wicket allowed some stability, and Kusal Perera got going towards the end of his fifty. A flourish from Rajapaksa and Malinga too at the end. But"

129,"Lahiru Kumara to Finch, 1 leg bye big appeal first ball! Nips back from a good length, takes Finch on the back leg...a familiar-style of issue for Finch. Caught on the crease with the ball coming back and the review has been called. It has struck him quite high, above the roll on his back leg and he's on his toes. Do we have the t"

131,"Lahiru Kumara to Warner, no run what a beauty! At 148kph as well...a ripper from Kumara, back of a length at middle and leg, completely squares up Warner and beats him, clipping the back leg through the keeper who can't take it cleanly. Good job there was no edge"
132,"Lahiru Kumara to Warner, FOUR runs bang! Strong response from Warner as he rocks back to a short ball and hammers a pull well in front of square. This is good stuff"

144,"Pradeep to Warner, 1 run dropped at mid-off! A flying effort from Malinga, who flung himself to his right and had the ball, but it burst out as he hit the ground. Warner driving on the up with immense power. Not sure that was quite as tough as Malinga made out"

212,"Lahiru Kumara to Warner, 1 run legcutter dropped short and down leg side, pulled to fine leg"
213,"Lahiru Kumara to Turner, SIX runs steers this over the fine leg boundary. Bouncer rising down leg side. He stays inside the line and shapes to hook, but there's minimal use of the wrists. It's more a ramp by the time he's done"
214,"Lahiru Kumara to Turner, 1 run full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
215,"Lahiru Kumara to Warner, SIX runs smoked wide of long-on! Length ball on off stump, sitting nicely up for the slog. He gets the front leg out of the way and slogs nonchalanty"
216,"Sandakan to Turner, 2 runs full googly on leg stump. Leans in and clips through midwicket with soft hands"
217,"Sandakan to Turner, no run full and very wide outside off. Gets down for the paddle sweep but is beaten"
218,"Sandakan to Turner, no run length ball outside off, shuffles and looks to paddle that. Cops it on the pad outside off stump"
219,"Sandakan to Turner, 1 run short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper"
220,"Sandakan to Warner, 1 run short of a length just outside off, stays leg side and chops it to sweeper to bring up his third consecutive fifty"

226,"Malinga to Warner, 2 runs full outside off, leans in and drives to third man's left"
227,"Malinga to Warner, no run slow dipping full toss on off stump. Watchfully tapped to extra cover"
228,"Malinga to Warner, 2 leg byes slower ball at a length on leg stump. Looks for the flick and deflects this in front of fine leg off the pad. Calls early for the second"
229,"Pradeep to Turner, no run length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
230,"Pradeep to Turner, 1 run full and into the pads. Stays tall and clips it down to fine leg"
231,"Pradeep to Warner, no run yorker at middle stump, jammed to midwicket"
232,"Pradeep to Warner, FOUR runs finished with a boundary! Attempted slower yorker it seems. Ends up as a leg-stump full toss. He holds his balance and caresses this to the long leg boundary"
233,"10:30pm Warner finishes unbeaten in the series. And that is another comprehensive win for Australia; the 3-0 scoreline tells it all. Sri Lanka have barely had a moment of dominance all series, and that didn't change tonight. The batting was improved, but not lethal, while it was much the same story with the ball."
