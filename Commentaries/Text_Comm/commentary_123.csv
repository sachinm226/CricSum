0,9.30am Zimbabwe win the toss and elect to bowl. Mpofu in for Jarvis. Australia unchanged
1,"Nyumbu to Finch, 1 run flat ball on off, and spinning into Finch. He taps it off the front foot to midwicket to get off the mark. Nobody there so the bowler has to go running after it"
2,"Nyumbu to Short, 1 run fuller outside off, and that's been tentatively punched off the front foot. Long off cleans up"
3,"Nyumbu to Finch, 1 run flat on off once again. Finch rocks back and pushes at it to the fielder at long on. He's content with a single"
4,"Nyumbu to Short, 2 runs full and wide outside off, and Short crunches this drive through the covers. Goes past the infielders, and long off has to go racing to his right. Has a shy at the keeper's stumps, but Short manages to scamper back"
5,"Nyumbu to Short, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! But not given. Full on middle, but drifting down leg. Short misses the shot to midwicket and the ball hits his front leg"
6,"Nyumbu to Finch, 2 runs full outside off, and flicked away to the vacant midwicket region. Nice, early call for the single from Finch"
7,"Muzarabani to Short, no run full on middle, and Short defends it straight back to the bowler. Comes off the bat's inside half on this occasion"
8,"Muzarabani to Short, no run length ball on off, and angling further wide from Short. He chases after it, trying to cut it over point, but misses the shot completely. Short will be disappointed that he offered no footwork. Could've easily got that over the infield for a boundary"
9,"Muzarabani to Short, 1 run low full toss on middle, and Short attempts the cover drive. Slices the shot, though, and therefore it trickles down to third man instead. Muzarabani was looking for the yorker, but just missed his length there"
10,"Muzarabani to Finch, FOUR runs length ball outside off, and that's been drilled through cover! Stands tall and punches it through the infield. Hits it from right under his eyes. Looking good already!"
11,"Muzarabani to Finch, no run full just outside off, and Finch chooses to block with soft hands. The ball hits his bat and flies away to backward point"
12,"Muzarabani to Finch, 1 run back of a length outside off, and Finch is rather surprised by the lack of bounce. Turns it off his hips to midwicket and calls early for the single. Short wants two, but Finch says no"
13,"Nyumbu to Finch, FOUR runs length ball outside off, but Finch backs away to make some extra room. Flat-bats it over the bowler's head, like a gentle lob over Nyumbu, and the ball races into the long-off boundary"
14,"Nyumbu to Finch, FOUR runs full on middle, but Finch simply steps forward and uses his wrists to whip it over the square-leg umpire. Well timed, not too hard, not too soft"
15,"Nyumbu to Finch, FOUR runs back of a length on middle, and Finch backs away once more. Cuts it inside out past the diving cover fielder for a hat-trick of fours!"
16,"Nyumbu to Finch, 1 run length ball outside off, and spinning into Finch. He makes some room and mistimes the cut to point"
17,"Nyumbu to Short, no run full on off, and Short looks to tee up and smack it straight down the ground. Checks his shot at the last moment though"
18,"Nyumbu to Short, FOUR runs thick outside edge! But there's nobody at slip. The first ball from Nyumbu that didn't have a slip for Short. He tried to punch this through cover, but the ball took the outside of his bat. Races away to the third-man boundary. Cruel, cruel sport"
19,"Mpofu to Finch, no run full just outside off, and too close for Finch to cut. He tries the shot anyway, and should be lucky that the ball didn't take the bat's outside edge"
20,"Mpofu to Finch, SIX runs there's the first six! Full on middle, and Finch takes a big stride forward to meet the ball on the full. Proper follow through of the bat as he tonks an on-drive over the wide long-on boundary"
21,"Mpofu to Finch, no run back of a length on the fourth-stump line outside off. Finch rides the bounce and punches to cover"
22,"Mpofu to Finch, 1 run length ball outside off, and the delivery stays slightly low. Takes Finch by surprise as he check punches off the back foot. Mistimed to mid on"
23,"Mpofu to Short, 1 run length ball outside off, but slower from Mpofu. Short turns this off his hips to the vacant square-leg region for a jogging single"
24,"Mpofu to Finch, 1 run full on off, and Finch blocks it with soft hands. Plays it to short cover and calls early for the single. He'll keep strike"
25,"Muzarabani to Finch, 4 leg byes back of a length outside off, but angling into Finch. He tries to whip it to the leg-side, but the ball hits the top of his pads and races away to the third-man boundary. The bowler wouldn't mind that, despite the free runs"
26,"Muzarabani to Finch, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, and Finch backs away to the leg side to free his arms. Stands tall and thumps this with the flat bat over mid off. Muscled, really"
27,"Muzarabani to Finch, SIX runs full outside off, and once again allowing Finch to open his shoulders. Offers the bat's full follow through and lifts it over extra cover for a monster hit"
28,"Muzarabani to Finch, 1 run bouncer on off, but Finch simply rolls his gloves over this pull shot. Plays it along the ground to the outfielder in the deep"
29,"Muzarabani to Short, 1 wide length ball outside leg stump, and going down leg. Short misses the flick to fine leg, but the ball takes a feather touch off his thigh pad. The keeper appeals but the umpire isn't interested. Calls it as a wide as well"
30,"Muzarabani to Short, no run full on middle, and angling away from Short. He tries to play the big on-drive through mid on, but plays inside the line of the delivery. The ball flies into the keeper's gloves"
31,"Muzarabani to Short, FOUR runs too full on off, and driven square through the covers! Pays the price for overcompensating on his length. Short mistimes that drive, but still has enough behind it to earn a boundary"
32,"Mpofu to Finch, FOUR runs length ball drifting down leg, and Finch has no problem in flicking it fine past the keeper's left. The ball runs away to the fine-leg boundary in no time"
33,"Mpofu to Finch, no run short and wide outside off, but with the pace taken off this delivery. Finch looks to cut it square, but he's through his shot too early. Mistimed to short cover"
34,"Mpofu to Finch, SIX runs full on middle, and Finch makes room towards the leg side before freeing his arms. Has a proper swing of the bat, and tonks this over midwicket. The bat turns in his hands, but still finds the fence. Fifty in 22 balls!"
35,"Mpofu to Finch, FOUR runs short and wide, and Finch was waiting for that width. Slaps a cut through the square region and not a single infielder moved an inch!"
36,"Mpofu to Finch, 1 run full on middle, and comfortably nudged off his pads to the sweeper fielder on the leg side"
37,"Mpofu to Short, no run back of a length on off, and Short pulls to midwicket. In the air for a while, but lands just short of Masakadza. Australia at 75 for 0 at the end of the Powerplay"
38,"Chisoro to Finch, 1 run back of a length on off, and Finch works it off the back foot to the leg side. Quick single"
39,"Chisoro to Short, no run length ball outside off, and spinning further away from Short. Attempts a cut, but the ball goes under his bat"
40,"Chisoro to Short, 2 runs length ball on middle, and Short shuffles across to the off side. Turns it off his legs to fine leg"
41,"Chisoro to Short, no run length ball outside off, and Short tries to punch this to the off side. Finds the fielder at cover but still wants the single. Better sense prevails as Finch sends Short back"
42,"Chisoro to Short, no run good length outside off, and angling away from the left-hander. Short tries to poke at it, but can't get bat to ball"
43,"Chisoro to Short, 1 run fuller on off, and Short nudges it to the vacant midwicket region for a single. Best over of the day for Zimbabwe"
44,"Burl to Short, no run full on middle, but no legspin on offer. Turned off the front foot to square leg"
45,"Burl to Short, 1 run full outside off, and Short comes dancing down the wicket. Drives it, rather uncomfortably, to the fielder at extra cover"
46,"Burl to Finch, SIX runs full outside off, and Finch goes down on one knee to meet this ball. Thumps it over the non-striker and the ball soars over the fielder at long on as well!"
47,"Burl to Finch, FOUR runs savage! Full, but wide outside off. But no problem for Finch. Gets down on one knee again, and drives it over Burl to the straight boundary. One-bounce four"
48,"Burl to Finch, 2 runs good length on middle, and worked off his pads to the leg side. Nobody's there in the infield so both keeper and bowler go running after it. With no one manning the stumps, Finch has no trouble coming back for the second run"
49,"Burl to Finch, 1 run full on middle, but drifting down leg. Finch pushes it to deep midwicket for one"
50,"Chisoro to Finch, 1 run back of a length on middle. Finch rocks back and pulls this straight to the fielder at deep backward square"
51,"Chisoro to Short, no run length ball outside off, and Short carves a late cut. Straight to backward point though"

55,"Chisoro to Short, no run full on middle, and driven to the leg side. Finds midwicket though"
56,"Chibhabha to Finch, 1 run full just outside off, and Finch must adjust due to the lack of pace in this delivery. Punched past the bowler to long off"
57,"Chibhabha to Short, 1 run back of a length outside off, and Short slaps this cut past the diving point fielder. The man in the deep manages to intercept though"
58,"Chibhabha to Finch, 2 runs slower ball, but short on off again. Finch drags the pull to deep midwicket, and enough time for the duo to take the second. Wayward throw from the deep to the bowler. If he was accurate, then Short may have been...short"
59,"Chibhabha to Finch, FOUR runs carnage! Full on off, and he shovels this over the umpire. Sends him ducking as the ball races away to the straight boundary"
60,"Chibhabha to Finch, 1 run length ball outside off, but angling into Finch. He opens his bat's face and glances it to backward point"
61,"Chibhabha to Short, 1 run length ball on off and angling away from Short. He pulls it in front of square to the fielder in the deep. Australia at 106 for 0 after ten overs"
62,"Chisoro to Short, no run yorker on middle stump, and Short just about manages to dig this ball away to the leg side"
63,"Chisoro to Short, no run full on middle, and Short prods forward. Defends it back to Chisoro"
64,"Chisoro to Short, 1 run full on off, and Short uses his wrists to drive through the empty mid-off region"
65,"Chisoro to Finch, 1 run yorker on leg stump, but Finch was backing away already to make some extra room. But the ball lands too close to him, and Finch can't drive it away. Goes through to the keeper"
66,"Chisoro to Short, 1 run full on leg, and Finch backs away once again. Drags this drive to long on"
67,"Chisoro to Finch, 1 run full on middle, and turned off his toes to the fielder at deep backward square. Just a single"
68,"Chibhabha to Finch, 2 runs short and wide outside off, and Finch flat-bats it straight to the bowler. Chibhabha sticks his right hand out, and the ball hits him full on the palm. That must've hurt, but the bowler doesn't show it. The ball goes away to the long-on boundary"
69,"Chibhabha to Finch, no run short just outside off, and Finch misses the pull over midwicket. Done in by the slower-ball bouncer"
70,"Chibhabha to Finch, 2 runs length ball outside off, and Finch drags a pull to the leg side on this occasion. The bowler's taken the pace off his bowling in this over"
71,"Chibhabha to Finch, no run full on middle, and he paddles this behind square on the leg side. Straight to short fine leg though"
72,"Chibhabha to Finch, FOUR runs muscled over cow corner! What power from Finch. It's a half tracker on off, and Finch can really tee up to this delivery. Smashes it to the boundary"
73,"Chibhabha to Finch, 1 run back of a length outside off, and Finch tiptoes to flick this off his hips. Played to the backward square leg boundary"

75,"Chisoro to Finch, 1 run full on middle, and driven inside out to cover. Gives Short the strike once again"

77,"Chisoro to Finch, no run cheeky! But doesn't come off. Full on off, and Finch tries to ramp it over the keeper's head. Misses out"
78,"Chisoro to Finch, SIX runs moves on to 98! Full on leg, but Finch shuffles across to the leg side. Lifts it over long off thereafter. Too easy for the man"
79,"Chisoro to Finch, no run quicker ball to end the over. Length ball on middle, and spinning into Finch's body. Misses out on the leg-side flick"
80,"Burl to Short, SIX runs full outside off, and spinning further away. He's forced to reach at it, but still manages to clear the boundary. Slices this over wide long off!"

91,"Nyumbu to Finch, 2 runs good length outside off, and Finch shuffles across to the off side to cut. Mistimes it to cover"
92,"Mire to Short, 1 run full outside off, and Short tries to muscle it to midwicket. The ball takes the inside edge, and goes to short fine leg instead. Almost crashed into off stump!"
93,"Mire to Finch, FOUR runs good length outside off, and Finch has all the time to drag this pull to the leg side. The bowler tried to bowl this from the back of his hand, but Finch wasn't troubled at all. One-bounce four"

99,"Mpofu to Finch, 2 runs good length on leg stump, and Finch backs away to the leg side. Drags the shot to cow corner, but still wants two. Could be trouble, but the throw isn't great. Finch survives"

103,"Mpofu to Finch, 1 run low full toss outside off, Finch muscles this down the ground to long on. He'll keep strike"
104,"Muzarabani to Finch, no run short outside off, and Finch attempts the pull. A rare missed shot from the batsman, as the keeper appeals for caught behind. The umpire isn't interested"
105,"Muzarabani to Finch, 1 run length ball outside off, but angling into Finch. He pulls it over the square-leg umpire, and goes to the fielder in the deep on the bounce. Falls just short of the fielder"
106,"Muzarabani to Short, 1 run full on off, and that's been driven straight to long off. Hit too well, and therefore just a single"
107,"Muzarabani to Finch, 1 run length ball but wide outside off. Finch has to reach out because of how far it is, but he still manages to flat bat it over the bowler. Looks like it's going for a six, but Chisoro manages to palm the ball back! Excellent effort at long on to stop the boundary"
108,"Muzarabani to Short, 1 run full at the base of off stump, and Short check-drives to Masakanda at cover. An excellent stop"

117,"Muzarabani to Finch, 1 run full on off, and all Finch can do is drive it straight to long off"
118,"Muzarabani to Short, 1 wide full and wide outside off. Too wide, in fact"
119,"Muzarabani to Short, OUT first wicket! Short slices this in the air, and the short ball does him in. Goes for the leg-side swipe, but he was through his shot too early. Taken by the keeper"
120,"Muzarabani to Finch, 2 runs short outside off, and Finch flat-bats it past cover to the man in the deep. Comfortable two for Finch. Moves to 170"

123,"Muzarabani to Stoinis, 1 run length ball outside off, and muscled to long off for a walking single"
124,"Muzarabani to Maxwell, no run short outside off, and Maxwell can't put this away. Tries to cut but the ball goes over his bat. Australia finish on 229 for 2!"
125,"Finch: Feeling good. The wicket played better than we thought. It came on well. I knew about the records when I was batting, but a few things went my way today. I took the strike from Short a bit, but that kind of innings for him will also help him. When the wickets get slower and lower, that kind of innings will help. I"
126,"11.28am What carnage. Australia set the record for highest T20I partnership, Finch sets the world record for highest T20I score, but Australia end up with only 229. A good performance, but imagine what Australia could've achieved if D'Arcy Short batted with more intent. Will Zimbabwe attempt to chase this down? We'll see"

130,"Stanlake to Chibhabha, 2 runs good length outside off, and cut away to point. Mistimed, but they go for the single anyway. The fielder aims at the stumps, and gets a direct hit at the non-striker's! The batsman's safe, and therefore Zimbabwe collect a few more overthrow runs"
131,"Stanlake to Chibhabha, 2 runs good length just outside off, and Chibhabha rides the bounce to poke this down to third man. Another direct hit from the deep, and that allows the batsmen to steal an extra single"
132,"Stanlake to Chibhabha, no run full on middle, and that's been pushed off the front foot to midwicket. Big 'no' for the single"

141,"Jhye Richardson to Mire, no run full outside off, but swings in sharply into Mire's pads. Tries to work it to the leg side, but misses and the ball hits his front leg. Impact's on leg stump though, so that means the ball would've certainly missed the wickets"

149,"Stanlake to Mire, no run good length outside off, but takes some extra bounce! Through to Carey as Mire misses the cut. Was too close his body anyway"
150,"Jhye Richardson to Chibhabha, FOUR runs length ball outside off, and that's been punched! Pierces the two fielders at cover, and times this beautifully for four. Zimbabwe are chasing this game..."
