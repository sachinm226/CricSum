291,"Shilling to Wade, OUT caught at the boundary edge and excellent presence of mind by Bravo! And it's a five-for for Shillingford as well, Wade goes another of his slogs but doesn't get the distance, went flatter to deep midwicket and Bravo caught it, threw"
292,"Shilling to Hilfenhaus, no run"
293,"Shilling to Hilfenhaus, OUT well make that six for Shillingford! Tossed up generously and Hilfenhaus tries to hoick him away over the on side, misses it and the ball hits the middle stump"

295,Join us at 12.35. Alex will take you through the first hour.
296,"Another example of Australia's fighting spirit. There were a few hoicks and cuts that were missed so it wasn't flawless. But credit to Hilfenhaus for sticking it out. Without him, Wade wouldn't have reached his century."

347,"Lyon to Powell, no run round the wicket, blocked on off stump"
348,"Lyon to Powell, OUT short but dragged it on a real bonus wicket for Australia. Maybe it kept a touch low but the cut stroke has dragged a back of a length ball onto the base of off stump and that is a poor dismissal and a major blow for the West Indies"
