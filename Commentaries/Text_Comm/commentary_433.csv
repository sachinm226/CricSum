17,"Utseya to Haddin, no run Ah, what happened there? One of those rare occasions when the ball hit the stumps without disturbing the bails, I reckon. Replays awaited.

18,"Mpofu to Watson, FOUR runs 116 kph, rare loose delivery from Mpofu. In fact, just his second in the day as he delivers the full offcutter on leg stump. Once again, Watson tucks in with a flick through square leg"
19,"Mpofu to Watson, FOUR runs finally Australia realise this is not the World Test Championship. Mpofu bangs a short, friendly offcutter and Watson cracks the pull shot with the kind of fluency he showed in the Ashes. No one had a chance as it flew away well in front of square"
20,"Mpofu to Watson, 1 run back of a length and very close to off, the patent on one knee steer to third man from Watson."
21,"Mpofu to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin opens up now. He set himself up for the drive as he took a step out of the crease, but Mpofu kept it short of the length. That did not deter Haddin, who just extended the arms and swat-dragged it over wide mid on. Clean hit"

27,"Utseya to Haddin, no run full outside off, driven into the off side"
28,"Utseya to Haddin, no run lovely fielding from Ervine, saves four runs for his side. Tossed up outside off, Haddin drives against the spin and it seems headed for the cover boundary.

53,"Utseya to Haddin, OUT Zimbabwe's first ever referral now. Utseya lands this back of a length outside off and it comes in gently with the angle, and then sharply with the spin.

101,"Chigumbura to Watson, 1 run another one on the pads, Watto flicks behind square for one. Zim need to be careful here, they shouldn't let Watto get out of the nervous 50s too soon. Surely they know how many times he's been out in the 50s?"

229,"Price to Clarke, no run Clarke went back to pull but the length wasn't that short and the ball hurried on to him. He missed and got struck on the body."
230,"Price to Clarke, 1 run played towards deep square leg for a single"
231,"Price to White, 1 leg bye flat and down leg side. White attempts to paddle it past short fine leg but gets hit on the pad"
232,"Price to Clarke, no run Price fires the ball in at leg stump once again. Clarke can't make contact"
233,"Price to Clarke, 1 run Clarke goes back and nudges the ball through square"
234,"Price to Hussey, OUT and that's why! Bowled him! Hussey charges down the track and aims for the heave down the ground. Price drags it shorter, bowls it quicker and keeps it dead straight. Hussey misses by a long way, and Price hits the stumps."
235,"Price to Smith, FOUR runs and perhaps this is why. Smith backs away to a flat ball and flat-bats it hard down the ground. He's placed it straight enough to beat long-off"
236,"Price to Smith, SIX runs Smith brings up 250 with a superbly executed slow-sweep that sails high and far over deep backward square leg"
237,"Price to Smith, 1 run played towards deep point for a single"
238,"Price to Clarke, no run dabbed towards short third man"
239,"Price to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke steps forward and drives towards long-on for a single. Sloppy cricket from Zimbabwe as they concede an over throw"
240,"Mpofu to Smith, OUT Mpofu is very, very lucky. He bowled a rubbish ball, a full toss on leg stump. Smith could have smashed it, anywhere. Instead he sort of chipped it off his pads and straight to the fielder on the deep square leg boundary."
241,"Mpofu to Clarke, no run excellent ball to follow up, a yorker in the blockhole. Clarke digs it out. Such is life. A rubbish ball gets a wicket, an excellent one doesn't."
242,"Mpofu to Clarke, 1 run another full and straight ball, Clarke swings it towards long-on for one"
243,"Mpofu to Johnson, 2 runs a low full toss outside off stump. Driven powerfully towards long off where a fumble from Coventry allows the second"
244,"Mpofu to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson lifts the ball with the angle into him and places it into the gap on the deep square leg boundary. That's his zone and Mpofu needs to keep away from it. Full outside off is the way to go."
245,"Mpofu to Johnson, 1 run full toss outside off stump, Johnson swings hard and hits it down the ground towards long on."
246,We'll be back in about 40 minutes for the Zimbabwe chase.

248,17.41: Zimbabwe have done all they could to keep Australia to a manageable target and it's been a commendable effort. Their spinners were exceptional. Elton Chigumbura said at the toss that they were hoping to keep Australia below 270. Well they've done that. Now their batsmen have to handle the searing pace
249,"Taylor and Coventry are opening Zimbabwe's chase. Don't see too many batsmen wearing spectacles these days, but Coventry does. Shaun Tait has the new ball and is at the start of his massive run-up."
250,"""Could this be the first upset? Would be great in world cup context but I don't see Zim escaping the Aussie pace onslaught,"" says David."
251,"All I want is a good game. Meanwhile, we have some new apps on the block. For iPhone and Android."
252,"Tait to Taylor, 1 run 144kmh, short of a length and straight. Taylor stands tall on the back foot, dabs it towards the off side with soft hands, and calls for the quick single"
253,"Tait to Coventry, 1 wide full and fast but the line is down leg side. Tait doesn't want to be running that long run-up more times than necessary in Indian conditions"
254,"Tait to Coventry, no run short ball this time, outside off stump, Coventry lets it go through to Haddin"
255,"Tait to Coventry, no run good length ball at 143.6 kph outside off stump. Coventry lets it go again"
256,"Tait to Coventry, no run Coventry goes dangerously on to the back foot to a fullish ball that is very straight and defends"
257,"Tait to Coventry, no run Tait grunts as he lets one rip at 145 kph, the length is short and the line is outside off. Coventry shoulders arms"

259,"Lee to Taylor, 1 run full ball angling into the right-hander. Taylor works the ball off his pads towards deep square"

268,"Tait to Taylor, 1 wide his hearing needs to be exceptional to hear this one, it is extremely wide outside off"
269,"Tait to Taylor, 1 run punched off the back foot towards extra cover. More of ball hitting bat than the other way around. He sets off for a single and is home before Ponting's direct hit at the non-striker's end."
270,"Tait to Coventry, 2 runs Coventry gets on to the back foot and punches a shorter ball through the gap at cover point"
271,"Tait to Coventry, no run Coventry jumps back to defend a good length ball and wants one. Taylor doesn't"
272,"Lee to Taylor, no run full and straight at 137 kph, Taylor gets behind the line and defends"
273,"Lee to Taylor, 1 run short ball directed at the body. Taylor moves back and across just enough to work the ball behind square"
274,"Lee to Coventry, no run short of a length outside off stump, Coventry barely moves as he lifts his bat out of the way"
275,"Lee to Coventry, SIX runs that is one of the flattest sixes you'll see! Coventry laid into a length ball outside off and played the square drive with immense power. The ball rocketed off the bat and flew over the point boundary. It carried about ten feet over the boundary and smashed into the wall."
276,"Lee to Coventry, 1 run fuller length and straighter line, flicked off the pads through square leg"
277,"Lee to Taylor, no run left alone outside off stump"
278,"Johnson to Coventry, no run hits a good length with his first ball and is very straight. Coventry defends from his crease on the off side"

285,"Lee to Coventry, no run Coventry attempts to play the pull but was in no control whatsoever. Lee beats him with the short ball"
286,"Lee to Coventry, no run defended from the crease towards the off side"
287,"Lee to Coventry, OUT this was a likely dismissal. Coventry was edgy against the short ball and tried to pull this one from outside off stump. The top edge swirled high in the air and the ball descended in the region of silly mid-off, where Lee was waiting to take the caught and bowled"

308,"Lee to Taibu, no run Lee pitches on a perfect length on off stump. Taibu defends from his crease towards cover"

311,"Lee to Taibu, no run Lee was looking for the yorker and bowled a low and fast full toss. Taibu brings his bat down in time to keep it out"

315,"Johnson to Taylor, no run good length and very straight. Taylor defends towards the bowler"
316,"Johnson to Taylor, 1 run good length ball and Taylor pushes towards mid-off and takes on Ponting's arm. He doesn't have to worry though but Taibu does. Ponting reaches the ball in a flash and throws at the batsman's end. Taibu dives full length but the throw misses"
317,"Johnson to Taibu, OUT he's given Watson some catching practice at first slip. Taibu tried to guide the ball towards third man by opening the face but the line of the short of a length ball was far too close to the body.

321,"Tait to Taylor, no run defended on the front foot towards midwicket"
322,"Tait to Taylor, OUT bowled him! Taylor tried to work the ball on the leg side from his crease and closed the face of the bat. He missed and Tait sped the ball through and grazed the pad before uprooting middle stump. Nothing special, just straight, fast and very effective."

329,"Johnson to Ervine, OUT Johnson bowls a full, fast and straight ball that thuds into Ervine's pads as he tries to play across the line and falls over a touch. Johnson roars an appeal but Asoka de Silva is unmoved, again. Haddin is adamant that it should be reviewed. Replays show that it's pretty plumb."
330,"Johnson to Williams, no run another full and straight ball that hits the pad. Johnson appeals but not as convincingly this time. It might have been missing leg so there's no review."
331,"Johnson to Williams, no run Johnson hits the pad again as Williams tries to work the ball on the leg side. Missing leg again."

346,"Krejza to Williams, no run straighter, Williams reaches out and smothers the spin"

354,"Watson to Williams, no run similar ball, a touch fuller, similar response from Williams who defends to the off side"
355,"Watson to Williams, no run very full, on the stumps and this time Williams plays through mid on. Not much feet movement, and Sunny Gavaskar doesn't quite appreciate it, on air."

367,"Watson to Williams, no run full length on middle and leg, Williams looks to flick and gets a leading edge,"

371,"Krejza to Chigumbura, 3 runs well played Elton, plays the field to perfection. Tossed up and turning into him from outside off, Elton knew there was a gap at deep extra cover and decided to drive against the spin in the air. Almost went all the way too."

381,"Krejza to Williams, 1 run short of a length and straightening from outside off, cut away through cover point for one"
382,"Krejza to Chigumbura, OUT Elton's gone. Krejza throws this up well outside off and he goes for the lap-sweep. Too ambitious, he had to bring that around from a long way off, and ended up getting gloving a top edge that popped up on the off side. Haddin runs across and pouches it, then hurries back to"

399,"Tait to Chakabva, no run that's what Tait does best, a Waqar Younisesque thunderbolt straight at the toes, and Regis has no clue where it went after hastily removing his feet from the danger area and stopping the irresistable force. What a yorker."

404,"Tait to Williams, OUT Tait's blown Williams away with 144.7 kph of unplayable pace. Almost a yorker again, from wide of the crease from round the wicket, homes the guided missile in on the line of off stump. Williams has played back to everything, think he'd make a good playback singer. He hangs deep"

418,"Krejza to Chakabva, OUT Regis perishes to a strange shot, trying to pull a length ball tossed up around middle and leg.
