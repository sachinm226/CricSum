235,"Watson to Yardy, 1 run Yardy's lack of timing saves him here as the drive goes one-bounce to deepish mid-off"
236,"Hussey to Yardy, FOUR runs excellent shot from Yardy, really top stuff. Down the wicket and giving himself room to drive into a gap wide of long-off for four. This is turning into an unlikely gem of an innings"
237,"Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this is horridly timed down the ground, trickling to long-on"
238,"Hussey to Shahzad, OUT Hussey gets another! What figures he has. Shahzad mistimes a full toss and it loops to midwicket who takes a very gentle chance"
239,"Hussey to Yardy, FOUR runs Yardy is down the wicket, giving himself some room and drives excellently down the ground and times it well enough to run for four"
240,"Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this is shoved in very short and Yardy should have got more, in the end he belted a pull shot to deep midwicket. Leaves Tremlett to try and bring up the 300"
241,"Hussey to Tremlett, no run good finish to an excellent spell from Hussey, shoved in quick and full and past Tremlett's attempted drive"
242,"So Australia will need 300 to win the match and seal the series. England started and finished well but again a mid-innings stumble cost them. It's a very good wicket and the outfield is swift so Australia should back themselves to do it. England, remember, only have three frontline bowlers. Peter English will have a bulletin"
243,Watson and Haddin to open. James Anderson is back in England's team and is opening the attack. One slip in place.
244,"About five minutes to go before the Australian openers come out and try to seal the series at the Adelaide Oval. If Australia get to 300, the last three games of this series will be dead rubbers. 300 is a long way away though."

246,"Anderson to Haddin, no run good length around off stump, Haddin stays in his crease and defends"

258,"Anderson to Watson, no run defended on the front foot"

260,"Anderson to Watson, no run defended on the back foot"
261,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run dabbed towards the off side, Haddin wanted a risky single and he would have been history had Collingwood hit the stumps from point"

267,"Shahzad to Haddin, no run pushed off the back foot towards point"
268,"Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs makes room and smash! Haddin goes inside out and lofts the ball over mid-off for four. Clean, crisp contact to a length delivery"
269,"Anderson to Watson, 1 run driven firmly off the front foot towards extra cover. The fielder there can't stop it cleanly so there's a single available"
270,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs and Haddin does it again. Length delivery outside off stump. Haddin moves outside leg and lifts the ball over mid-off for another inside-out four"
271,"Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs short and wide outside off, Haddin makes a bit of room - not as much as previous times - but absolutely blazes it through point with a fierce cut shot"

274,"Anderson to Watson, no run defended on the front foot once again"
275,"Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs good length ball and this time Haddin moves a touch towards the off and swings the ball wide of the fielder at short fine leg. He didn't middle that - more of an inside edge - but he will take it"
276,"Tremlett to Haddin, no run defended on the back foot towards the off"
277,"Tremlett to Haddin, no run Haddin winds up and has a hard swing at a good length delivery. He gets a thick inside edge on to his thigh"

279,"Tremlett to Watson, no run Watson stays solid in defence and plays from the crease"

282,"Anderson to Marsh, no run no room for Marsh to work with whatsoever with this angle into him, he pushes on the off side"
283,"Anderson to Marsh, no run"
284,"Anderson to Marsh, OUT caught and bowled! Anderson was testing Marsh with this angle into the left-hander from round the wicket. He was attacking the stumps constantly and not giving the batsman room. Marsh pushed a bit more at this one, the ball hit the bat a little low and went straight back to the bowler. Caught and"

396,"Shahzad to White, no run back on careful defence here"

405,"Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs starts with a pretty meek half-tracker that is pulled smartly, in front of midwicket where... OH NO! Silly KP slid to field with one hand, flicked it up but onto his own body and it bounced off over the rope. Oops"

414,"Trott to White, 3 runs White has seen enough and goes for a booming drive down the ground, not perfectly timed and Luke Wright slid brilliantly to pull off a remarkable save on the long-off boundary. He really is a special(ist) fielder"
415,"Trott to Hussey, no run driven hard again but straight to cover"

433,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run this is driven firmly back down the wicket"
434,"Yardy to White, no run waa? Moon-ball! Like Jeremy Snape. It was so, so slow and full - a full toss in fact. It should have ended up out of Adelaide but White didn't pick it up and patted it back to the bowler"

441,"Yardy to Hussey, 1 run another milked single down the ground"
442,"Yardy to White, FOUR runs finally White times one! Down the wicket and lifting this into a gap wide of deep cover, it sped to the rope"
443,"Yardy to White, 1 run driven firmly back towards the bowler who dives to get a hand on it. Brings up a 50 stand, it took a while"
