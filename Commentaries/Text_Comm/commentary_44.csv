21,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run keeps it tight on off stump, and Finch guides it towards point for a quick single"

30,"Jadeja to Finch, no run stronger appeal this time but not given. They're not going to review. This looked very close, but perhaps he was struck just outside the line of off. Good flight by Jadeja, and on a nice length, he's coming forward to defend but is beaten on the inside edge and struck on t"

32,"Jadeja to Finch, 1 run tucked through square"
33,"Chahal to Finch, no run length outside off, cuts to point"

45,"Jadeja to Finch, no run given some air outside off, and he defends"
46,"Chahal to Warner, 2 wide flatter on leg stump, tries to go down and slog sweep, but misses it. Goes down leg so it's a wide and they take a single too"
47,"Chahal to Finch, no run googly outside off, he can't work it away"
48,"Chahal to Finch, SIX runs nails the slog across the line. The length was too full that time from Chahal, and Finch spotted that, took a confident stride out and whacked it across the line and over the deep midwicket fence"

57,"Jadeja to Finch, no run targetting the stumps and Finch offers a straight bat back"

59,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run misses the direct hit at the bowler's end. Length ball angling into him, and this was tapped to mid-on. They ran through and Jadeja was the man there, swoops in and lets loose a throw. Misses the stumps - Finch was miles out if he had hit"

73,"Bumrah to Finch, no run yorker on the stumps, goes back and punches to mid-on"

76,"Bumrah to Warner, 4 leg byes unlucky for the bowler. Warner was backing away a long way, Bumrah followed him and did so excellently too, but the yorker length ball flicks his pad and goes very fine for four leg-byes"
