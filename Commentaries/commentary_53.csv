204,"Siraj to Maxwell, FOUR runs 139kph, full and wide, Maxwell backs away reaches out with one hand and slices this past backward point and away to the rope! What a shot!"
205,"Siraj to Maxwell, 1 leg bye 139kph, low full toss, inside edge onto pad, it rolls past off stump to short third man"
206,"Siraj to Marsh, FOUR runs full toss wide of off, Marsh cracks a cover-drive, smoking it past the man in the circle to the rope! Easy pickings."
207,"Shami to Maxwell, FOUR runs 138kph, full toss on off, he steps outside leg and lofts this up and over cover! Incredible hands to slice it into the gap! Deliberately done"
208,"Shami to Maxwell, no run 127kph, slower ball, length outside off, he goes leg side again but misses. Maxwell yells at himself for missing that"
209,"Shami to Maxwell, 1 run 122kph, slower ball, follows him down leg as he backs away, he glances in the air just short of short fine! They get one as the fielder knocks it down"
210,"Shami to Marsh, SIX runs length on leg, 131kph, and Marsh pumps this over the short boundary way back into the stands at square leg! A gift from Shami. Marsh says thank you!"
211,"Shami to Marsh, 1 run wide half-volley he cracks a square drive firmly to deep point"
212,"Shami to Maxwell, 1 run 136kph, thigh high full toss, he sits back and whips this with a flourish behind square"
213,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 wide 118kph, slower ball, right on the guideline outside off, Maxwell backs away but the umpire calls wide! Unlucky there. Not sure that was a wide"
214,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 2 runs 117kph, length slower ball, he carves it to deep cover-point, Maxwell calls two and takes on the throw and beats it easily!"
215,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, no run wide yorker, well bowled, slides under the bat outside off"
216,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, no run 115kph, slower ball wide of off, Maxwell swings very hard and misses. Beautifully bowled. Deceived for pace"
217,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 run 116kph, length slower ball wide of off, he toes a cut shot to cover, runs with the stroke a misfield on the circle means there's no run out chance"
218,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, SIX runs 121kph, length ball in the slot, Marsh clears the right leg and heaves this way over deep square into the Members! Right in the hitting arc and he cashed in"
219,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, 2 runs 136kph, full on middle, he drives back past the bowler, straight of long on and they get an easy two"
220,"Siraj to Maxwell, 2 runs wide half-volley, he carves this in the air towards the man at deep point and it's just short of him running in, they get two"
221,"Siraj to Maxwell, 1 run dropped by Rohit Sharma at cover! Almost a freakish catch! It was crushed at cover, Rohit threw his right hand up above his head, it almost stuck, he had three bites at it but couldn't hold on!"
222,"Siraj to Marsh, 1 run full outside off, he lofts a cover-drive straight if the man in the deep"
223,"Siraj to Maxwell, FOUR runs 138kph, low full toss, he sits back and whips this through midwicket and the timing is good enough to beat wide long on running around!"
224,"Siraj to Maxwell, no run 141kph, bouncer, outside off, he tries to upper cut and misses, it's not called for height. Well bowled"
225,"Siraj to Maxwell, 1 run full into middle and leg, he whips this out through midwicket to the sweeper"
226,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 run 118kph, wide half-volley, outside the wide line, he jumps out and slaps it to cover. Would have been a wide if he'd let it go"
227,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, 1 run 135kph, yorker speared in at leg stump, he clips this out through square leg"
228,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, OUT caught at deep long off! Undone by a 119kph slower ball. It was a good length and wide, Maxwell tried to loft this over cover, but he dragged it to long off, DK stands 15 metres in off the rope and takes the catch easily"
229,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, no run 117kph, slower ball, angled wide off, he let it go thinking it might have been a wide but it was just inside the guideline. Well bowled"
230,"Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, OUT caught at long off! Bhuvi does it again with a slower ball! Good length slower ball outside off, Marsh lofts this towards long off but doesn't nail it, Jadeja, like DK, camps 15 metres in off the rope and takes the easy catch! Superb innings from Marsh ends with 13 balls remaining"
231,"Bhuvneshwar to Jhye Richardson, 1 run 136kph, full on off, he pushes this to cover and goes with the stroke"
232,"Shami to Jhye Richardson, no run 139kph, yorker on off, he clears the left leg and squeezes this out to cover"
233,"Shami to Jhye Richardson, no run off cutter slower ball, 118kph, outside off, he tries to square drive but misses"

235,"Shami to Jhye Richardson, 1 run 141kph, yorker on middle, he digs this out towards long on"
236,"Shami to Lyon, 1 run Missed run out! 131kph, yorker, perfectly executed, he blocks it and runs, Shami gathers as Lyon runs into him, he looks up and throws at the striker's but misses by miles! Maybe stunned by the knock on the head from Lyon!"

238,"Bhuvneshwar to Siddle, OUT caught by Kohli on the run at deep backward point! 4 for 3! Great running catch! Another length slower ball outside off, Siddle slices a drive high to deep backward point, Kohli has to sprint off the rope to get there and he catches it at full stretch, running at top pace!"
239,"Bhuvneshwar to Lyon, 1 run 135kph, yorker, on off, he digs this out to midwicket for a single"
240,"Bhuvneshwar to Behrendorff, 1 run 135kph, full into middle, he turns this out through midwicket"
241,"Bhuvneshwar to Lyon, FOUR runs brilliant flick over short fine! 116kph, length slower ball outside off, Lyon picks it, steps outside off and flicks this up and over short fine leg! Super shot"
242,"Bhuvneshwar to Lyon, no run 118kph, slower ball outside off, he stands and slogs this time but misses"
243,"Bhuvneshwar to Lyon, SIX runs launched over midwicket 20 rows back! Wow! Lyon gets him! Bhuvneshwar missed his spot, slower ball outside off, but it was the perfect hitting length, he stepped across and slogged this high over midwicket and got all of it!"
244,"5.45pm Innings break India need 299 in the chase. It could have been a lot more if not for the last three overs from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami. They took 4 for 17 in the last 18 balls. Bhuvi getting the crucial scalps of Shaun Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. Could have saved India 10-20 runs, maybe more. Marsh was sublime."
245,"6.05pm Welcome back. At the same stage of the first ODI in Sydney, India looked like marginal favourites, but quickly slipped to 4 for 3 (or 3 for 4, depending on which way you read scorecards) to fall a long way behind. They're chasing a similar target today, against the same bowling attack. How will this innings pan out? We"
246,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run fullish to start, just a hint of swing to straighten it towards middle stump, clipped towards midwicket, who dives right to stop it"
247,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run some more swing, this time starts too straight and is definitely missing leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball beats his inside edge and thuds into pad"
248,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run nice length, swerving into middle and leg. Watches it nicely, keeps his front pad out of the way, and clips gently to midwicket"
249,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length outside off, Rohit leaves it alone. Threatened to come back in but eventually just kept going with the angle"
250,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run fullish on off stump, transfers his weight forward into a checked drive to mid-off"
251,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball slanting away into the fifth-stump channel. Left alone and Behrendorff begins with a maiden"
252,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run lovely ball to start with, on the fuller side of a good length and straightening back late into Dhawan's off and middle stumps. Keeps his front leg out of the way, brings down a straight bat, and picks up a single wide of mid-on to get off the mark in the series"
253,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length outside off, defended into the point region"
254,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs shortish outside off, only gets up to about hip high because it wasn't that short at all, but Rohit pounces on anything marginally in that region and he pulls it away nicely, into the gap between mid-on and midwicket"
255,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball sliding down leg. Misses the flick and the ball tickles front pad on its way to the keeper"
256,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs short, wide, and Rohit presses half-forward and just extends his arms out to play a straight-bat punch to beat third man to his right. Made it look so easy"
257,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run full now, in the sixth-stump channel with a bit of late outswing. Watches it well and leaves it alone"
258,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run nicely bowled, beautiful length and late swing away from a fourth-stump line. Dhawan presses forward, watches it all the way, and leaves it, shaping to defend and pulling his bat inside the line at the last moment"
259,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run full now, on middle and off, jams his bat down to squeeze it towards mid-on"
260,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run length ball slanting into leg stump. No swing this time. Dhawan plays across the line, looking to flick, and inside-edges into his front pad"
261,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 1 run fullish and wide outside off, reaches out and slashes it away, to the right of backward point. Richardson chases around to his left from third man to make a good stop"
262,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length on middle stump - keeps going with the angle rather than swinging back in as Rohit expected, and he's squared up a little and pops it off the outside half of the bat towards cover. Briefly in the air"
263,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, and once again the lack of inswing confounds Rohit. Squares him up again, on the back foot this time, and slides past his outside edge"
264,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run full outside off, slanting across from over the wicket. Doesn't really time his drive, rolls out slowly to point"
265,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs full, swings into the pads, and Dhawan whips it away beautifully. Places it perfectly too, beats square leg to his left and leaves fine leg with way too much distance to cover in the other direction"
266,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run ooh, that's a little wild from Dhawan. Slants this across the stumps, again quite full, and Dhawan plays for the inswing and looks to hoick this over mid-on cross-batted. Ends up missing completely"
267,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball on middle and leg, tucked away to long leg"
268,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
269,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, swings away after starting fairly wide of off stump, straightforward leave for Rohit"
270,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 4 leg byes back of a length, no swing, just ends up at Dhawan's front thigh pad and he helps it away to the fine leg boundary, past the diving keeper. Not sure if he got any bat on it, in fact"
271,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run full this time, on off stump, ends up looking to hit it square, through cover point, playing for swing, and it doesn't swing. He's lucky to get a thick inside edge that rolls into the leg side"
272,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 2 runs down the track now, Behrendorff pulls his length back slightly along an off-stump line. Swings across the line and swats it away through midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
273,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, FOUR runs shot! That's a wide half-volley alright, but how well did he hit that? Down on his back knee, frees his arms, and creams it to the left of the diving cover fielder"
274,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, no run full again, not quite as full this time, doesn't get the same power on his drive this time, hits it to the man at cover"
275,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 2 runs full on middle and leg, clipped away to the right of fine leg. Dhawan jams his bat into the turf while completing his second run, and nearly gets into a tangle with his feet as a result"
276,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length, angling into the legs. Tucked off the hip into the backward square leg region"
277,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs full, wide, four. He's going for his shots today, hasn't been afraid of throwing his bat at the wide ones. He's leaning back this time, not necessarily looking to get his weight forward and play along the ground. Ends up slicing it, but powerfully, in the air to the right of the div"
278,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run length ball outside off, punched on the up and Lyon saves four with a dive to his right at cover point"
279,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, no run back of a length, keeps going with the angle towards middle stump. Goes back and looks to work it into the leg side, closing his bat face too early. Hits him on the back pad, but pretty high, and Richardson's appeal isn't the most confident"
280,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 wide looks to angle it into the stumps again, ends up overdoing it and whanging it down the leg side"
281,"Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and opens his bat face for a gentle dab to third man"
282,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
283,"Siddle to S Dhawan, no run full outside off, squeezed out to backward point, who stops it with a dive to his left"
284,"Siddle to S Dhawan, no run back of a length, close to off stump. Doesn't get the width he wants - he was staying next to the line and looking to carve through the point region. Denied room, all he can do is chop it down gently into the off side"
285,"Siddle to S Dhawan, no run length ball, a little wider, slapped to cover point"
286,"Siddle to S Dhawan, 2 runs full on off stump, and Dhawan drives to the left of the newly stationed sweeper"
287,"Siddle to S Dhawan, FOUR runs shortish, leg-stumpish, Dhawan swivels round and pulls it to the left of short fine leg. Hardly the field to be bowling even remotely short to"
288,"Siddle to S Dhawan, 1 run length ball wide of off stump, driven crisply on the up to sweeper cover"
289,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 1 run back of a length, tucked off the hip into the fine leg region"
290,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full, swinging in from about leg stump, can't connect with the flick but gets enough pad on it to pick up a leg bye into the backward square leg region"
291,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, FOUR runs short outside off, and Dhawan loves it there. Plays a sensational shot too, hits deliberately underneath it, with a straight bat, up and over cover"
292,"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT and that is that. He's played with a lot of freedom today, but now he's played one shot too many. Length ball, angling into off stump, not quite full enough for the pick-up shot over midwicket. Plays too early, and ends up spooning it high in the air, off the outside half of the bat. Khawaja"
293,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, swings in to beat Rohit's flick and hit his front pad, but it pitched outside leg"
294,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and chops it down to third man"
295,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball angling in towards off stump, clipped into the leg side and midwicket dives left to stop it"
296,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
297,"Siddle to Kohli, no run Siddle throws in the wide tempter - go on, play that cover drive, he says, but Kohli judges the length well, knows it's not full enough, and leaves it alone"
298,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run now he goes full and straight, looking to hit front pad or off stump, and Kohli plays around that front pad to whip it round to fine leg. Hands-on-head time for Siddle"
299,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, 1 run gorgeous shot. Again a fullish ball angling into off stump. Just shows the full face and eases a drive to the left of mid-on"
300,"Siddle to Kohli, no run full outside off, and Kohli takes a big step forward and across and uses his wrists to whip it to mid-on. Unusual for him to do that so early in his innings, from so far outside off stump"
301,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Gives Rohit just enough room to free his arms and punch between backward point and cover"
302,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run once again plays for swing when there is none. Lovely length, and Rohit is stuck on the crease trying to whip it across the line. Beats the outside edge, hits thigh pad, and rolls to the right of the keeper"
303,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run extra bounce, and this time it does swing back in. Goes back to play that flick again, and this time it beats the inside edge to hit him on the thigh pad"
304,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball slanting across towards off stump, doesn't really get forward, just shuffles across and defends into the covers"
305,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run nice length, angling across the stumps, draws Rohit forward for a defensive push to mid-off"
306,"Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run beauty. He knows Rohit is tentative and is expecting that late inswing. There hasn't been much swing in this over. Fullish, not quite a half-volley, fairly wide of off stump, and it beats the outside edge as Rohit goes for the cover drive without getting a proper front-foot stride in"
307,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run back of a length to start, goes right back to work it into the backward square leg region"

309,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run floated up fairly full, just outside off, driven to long-on"
310,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball, slides on with the angle towards off stump. Rohit wants to work it away behind square, but the lack of turn forces him to play it in front of square, defensively"
311,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run a touch shorter, rocks back and punches through cover point"
312,"Lyon to Kohli, no run flatter on off stump, goes right back to punch this to midwicket"
313,"Jhye Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length outside off. Rohit gets half-forward and steers it to third man"

315,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run length ball outside off, presses forward and defends towards point"
316,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run length ball close to off stump, defended watchfully towards backward point"
317,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, FOUR runs back of a length, just a touch of width, and that's enough for Kohli. The extra fielder on the leg side means there's no cover point, and Kohli stands up tall and punches with a straight bat into that gap. Cover gives chase, to no avail"
318,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run full on off stump, driven firmly to mid-off"
319,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball slanting across to off stump. Stays on the back foot and clips to midwicket"

321,"Lyon to Kohli, no run back of a length on middle and leg, tucked off the hip to square leg"
322,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run again not full enough to draw the batsman forward. Kohli goes deep in his crease and across to work this from middle stump to deep backward square leg"
323,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run tossed up slower now, just outside off, stretches out to defend it back to the bowler"
324,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs shot! That's a good-length ball, but it's just wide enough outside off for Rohit to step back, get down low, and cut it away through backward point"
325,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run full, angling into off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
326,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs wow. That's just the stock ODI delivery from the fast bowler, back of a length, angling into off stump. Rohit steps half-forward and across, and brings his wrists into play for a pick-up shot that easily clears the square leg boundary"
327,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball outside off, punched into the covers"
328,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length outside off, guided down to third man with an open face"
329,"Siddle to Kohli, FOUR runs glorious. Fullish, angling into off stump, and Kohli plays that full-faced front-foot punch to send it whooshing past the left hand of the diving mid-on fielder"
330,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run length ball outside off, and there's nearly a mix-up between these two notorious mixers-up between wickets. Presses forward, jabs it safely to the left of backward point, and then hesitates midway through a straightforward single. But they get their bearings right quickly and complete it comfortab"
331,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched to long-on past the diving bowler"
332,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run length ball outside off, stays on the back foot, slightly besides the line, and punches to sweeper cover"
333,"Lyon to Kohli, no run length ball close to off stump, goes back and across to clip towards square leg"

335,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, goes right back in his crease to whip it to deep square leg"
336,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run length ball on middle stump, clips it to the right of midwicket - not too far from the fielder - and hares out of his crease. Kohli, rightly, sends him back, and Rohit has to dive to regain his crease"
337,"Siddle to Kohli, no run length ball on off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
338,"Siddle to Kohli, no run length ball outside off, Kohli stretches out to push into the cover point region. Backward point sprints out of his station quickly to cut off the single"
339,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run length ball close to off stump, punched away to deep point"
340,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs in the blockhole, angling into middle stump, gets his front leg out of the way to clip it past the left hand of the diving midwicket fielder. Was briefly, and tantalisingly, in the air too"
341,"Siddle to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length outside off, steered down to third man"
342,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run length ball, close to off stump. Lets it come on and taps it on its head to send it rolling away to third man"
343,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run 93kph, good length angled across, outside off, he late cuts, but a piece of glove on it slows it down"
344,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, no run shorter outside off, he just pushes to backward point"
345,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run tossed higher and slower outside off, he defends with soft hands close towards point and they get a quick one"
346,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run shorter on leg, he's back and working this off the hip through square leg"
347,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs tossed up in the arc, Rohit steps out and launches this sumptuously over midwicket, picking the gap and clearing the rope! His bat swing is so smooth."
348,"Lyon to Rohit Sharma, 1 run 92kph, good length on off, he turns it around the corner for a single"
349,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs 124kph, off cutter, he leans into a lovely drive past cover, straight of deep point for two"
350,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, no run 125kph, good length outside off, he defends on the front foot into the off side"
351,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run 129kph, back of a length outside off, he's on the front foot but pulls with control around the corner down to fine leg"
352,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run 131kph, outswinger wide of off, he plays a controlled square drive to deep point"
353,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, OUT caught at deep forward square! Rohit makes an error! Just short of a length, Rohit wants to pull this over the short square boundary, he gets under it but gets top edge, it flies to deep forward square, Handscomb runs in and to his left, looking straight into the setting sun, he takes a good"

365,"Stoinis to Rayudu, no run 131kph, back of a length outside off, he's back and across defending to cover"
366,"Stoinis to Rayudu, FOUR runs 131kph, good length outside off, he presses forward and opens the face and runs it fine, third man is in the circle! Well controlled by Rayudu. Certainly appeared a deliberate stroke."

489,"Siddle to Dhoni, 2 runs down the track and Siddle sees him coming. Bangs it in and gets it to rise towards his chest. Dhoni spins around and sends a miscontrolled pull soaring towards the fielder at long leg, but Behrendorff, diving forward, can't quite get to the ball before it lands"

496,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye that's super running. Back of a length, angling slightly down leg. Shuffles across and misses the flick, and the ball drops down by Dhoni's feet, to his left, after hitting his pad.

497,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, no run back of a length, close to off stump, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
498,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, 1 run ooh, that's a rare uncontrolled hoick from Kohli. Fullish, on off stump, looks to whip it over the leg side and gets a thick edge that nearly carries all the way to third man. Lands about three or four feet in front of him"

507,"Siddle to Kohli, 1 run full on middle stump, and Kohli chips it in the air - not sure if it was intentional - on the bounce to long-on. I think he was looking to flick it more through midwicket, and ended up checking his shot"

511,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run slower ball, back of a length, on middle stump. Dhoni shuffles across and nurdles it into the midwicket region. No one saving one on the leg side"
512,"Jhye Richardson to Kohli, OUT whoopsie. A huge moment for Australia, this. This is full, a half-volley on leg stump, and I don't know if Kohli was looking to hit this in the air, but he's flicked it, possibly a touch earlier than he wanted to, timed it perhaps better than he wanted to, and picked out the fielder at deep"

517,"Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs bam! Down the track and Lyon feeds him just where he wants the ball. A bit of flight, and outside off stump, and he can free his arms and hoick it away, with the turn, over the wide long-on boundary"

525,"Jhye Richardson to Karthik, 1 run length ball on off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
526,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 wide back of a length, gets his line all wrong. With pretty much everyone in the circle on the off side, he doesn't want to give Dhoni any width, and he ends up whanging it down the leg side. Dhoni merely steps across and shoulders arms"
527,"Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to tuck it through square leg"
528,"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run full, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler. I guess he was looking for the single to long-on but hit it straighter than intended"

532,"Stoinis to Karthik, no run length ball outside off, driven to extra-cover"
533,"Stoinis to Karthik, 2 runs length ball on off stump, looks like the offcutter. Clips it down the ground, doesn't put too much weight behind his shot, and they can pick up two by the time long-on sprints forward and to his right to get to it"
534,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, 1 run back of a length, slanting across into a fourth-stump line. Lots of bottom hand in that whip to deep midwicket"

544,"Stoinis to Karthik, 3 runs someone asked where all the scoop shots were - here it is. Slower length ball outside off, and Karthik steps across and helps it nice and fine. There's no one at short fine leg, and the man at fine leg is quite wide, more long leg than fine leg. And that placement allows these batsmen to run t"
545,"Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run fullish on off stump, and Dhoni goes for the big hit down the ground. Hits it pretty well, but straight to long-on, on the bounce"
546,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, SIX runs probably not. Back of a length on off stump, and MS Dhoni absolutely Dhonies this to bring up his fifty. Leans back, clears his front leg, and brings all that bottom-hand power into play to clear long-on as well. It'll be an interesting exercise to work out how many times he's hit this bal"
547,"Behrendorff to Dhoni, 1 run and there's the win. The field comes in, but there's still enough gaps to sneak that single. Full, close to off stump, and Dhoni clips it just wide of mid-on and hurries through to the other end. 2018 wasn't a great year for Dhoni. He's begun 2019 with two fifties in a row, the second one a v"
548,"9.45pm And with that, it's 1-1. An enthralling game here at Adelaide Oval, with Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni bringing all their chasing superpowers into play to make the difference in the end.
