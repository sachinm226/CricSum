0,6.50pm Australia have won the toss and will bowl
1,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, 1 wide down the leg side first up, a wide to get things going"
2,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, no run very full, outside off, a touch of late swing and jabbed to the covers off the toe end"
3,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, FOUR runs full and straight, flicked fine of short fine leg, whistles to the boundary. Just needed a touch"
4,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, 1 leg bye a little too straight again but this one rebounds off the pad towards square leg"
5,"Kane Richardson to Munro, 1 leg bye big appeal for lbw that looked to have pitched outside leg, Munro aiming to flick into the leg side"
6,"Kane Richardson to Guptill, 1 run full at off stump, pushed from the front foot into the leg side, sets off for the run straightaway but it doesn't beat midwicket. A clean stop and pick up from Stoinis would have been a run out chance"
7,"Kane Richardson to Munro, 3 runs full outside off, sliced square over the off side, skids across the outfield towards deep point. Tye chases and makes a good attempt to flick it back. He's done very well there"
8,"Stanlake to Munro, OUT strikes first ball! The short one. Munro goes for the pull, onto him too quickly, takes a big top edge and Carey moves around to the short fine-leg position to gather a simple chance. Probably not short enough for the stroke"
9,"Stanlake to Guptill, OUT what a ball! He's on a hat-trick! Good length at off stump, nips off the seam, beats the outside edge and takes the top of off stump. That's a beauty"
10,"Stanlake to Bruce, 3 runs goes for the yorker, not far off, 151kph, clipped through the leg side"
11,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run another top delivery! Full outside off, shapes away from Williamson who is feeling for it away from his body"
12,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run good length outside off, 145kph, defended to backward point"
13,"Stanlake to Williamson, 1 run a touch fuller, Williamson gets himself forward and pushes to the left of mid-off"
14,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, 1 wide pushed down the leg side, another wide, Richardson hasn't settled yet"
15,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run outside off this time, on a good length, defended on the front foot to cover"
16,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run that's a good one! Back of a length outside off, angles back, beats the inside edge...extra bounce"
17,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run full and straight, 138kph, clipped to midwicket"
18,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run more seam movement, jags back at Williamson from back of a length and takes him near a very delicate area"
19,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run short of a length outside off, opens the face a touch and finds point"
20,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, no run excellent stuff, short of a length again at off stump, Williamson tries to work it to the leg side but can only push it back towards the bowler...six dots after the wide"
21,"Stanlake to Bruce, no run stays on leg stump, gives himself a touch of room, mistimes a drive towards mid-on"
22,"Stanlake to Bruce, OUT and he has three! Another short ball. Well directed, over middle and off, Bruce can't control his hook, takes a top edge and is very well judged on the long-leg boundary"
23,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run back of a length outside off, 149kph, defended to backward point"
24,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run and another dot to the captain, short of a length outside off, played to the leg side"
25,"Stanlake to Williamson, no run a touch fuller, angles back and takes an inside edge...lining up the dot balls to Williamson"
26,"Stanlake to Williamson, 1 run gets this one away, but just for a single, flicked from outside off behind square on the leg side"
27,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, 1 run short of a length, a bottom-handed flick to the leg side"
28,"Kane Richardson to Taylor, no run short outside off, stays back in the crease and taps to the off side"
29,"Kane Richardson to Taylor, no run finds the outside edge, this was a touch fuller, but Taylor does well to keep it down, slip, who is wide, makes a good save"
30,"Kane Richardson to Taylor, FOUR runs fine of slip! Could they have had two slips? Touch of width outside off, Taylor plays a slashing cut, takes a top edge and goes through the gap"
31,"Kane Richardson to Taylor, 1 run a shorter ball, pulled to deep square"
32,"Kane Richardson to Williamson, 2 runs through the slips again, although Williamson was in control of this...a slower ball, short of a length, steered wide of the keeper but third man can get across"
33,"Stanlake to Taylor, 1 run an attempted yorker at 145kph, it's a low full toss dug out towards mid-on"
34,"Stanlake to Williamson, 1 run short of a length outside off, dropped square to the off side with soft hands and that's a good run"
35,"Stanlake to Taylor, 2 runs full outside off, Taylor's feet don't move as he drives through the line, skews off the inside half of the bat behind square on the leg side"
36,"Stanlake to Taylor, no run that's a wild swing across the line, a good-length ball, and it's not far from taking off stump"
37,"Stanlake to Taylor, no run a short ball outside off, goes for the pull and he's through his shot, takes the cue end and loops towards backward point"

41,"Stoinis to de Grandhomme, 1 run a straight full toss, clubbed down to long-on"
42,"Stoinis to Santner, no run nearly spooned back to the bowler, a length delivery, a cutter, stops in the surface and takes a leading edge"
43,"Stoinis to Santner, 1 run back of a length outside off, aiming to the leg side and takes a thick outside edge into backward point"
44,"Stoinis to de Grandhomme, no run a short ball over leg stump, beats the top edge...that's a superb over Stoinis, Australia have sneaked one through"
45,"Tye to Santner, no run full outside off, pushed firmly back to the bowler"
46,"Tye to Santner, OUT that's very high, and doesn't get further than deep midwicket...full and straight, Santner trying to go over the leg side, pace off the ball again, can't get anything like enough distance"
47,"Tye to de Grandhomme, 1 run flicks a full toss off the pads to deep midwicket...Australia will be pleased whenever he's off strike"
48,"Tye to Southee, 1 run full outside off, tapped towards backward point"
49,"Tye to de Grandhomme, 2 runs what save on the boundary! More brilliant work in the deep. De Grandhomme goes straight down the ground, looks like six, but Agar leaps on the rope, goes for the catch but knows he's going over the rope so flicks the ball back in...can't quite make it a rebound catch"

56,"Agar to Williamson, no run full, outside off, driven to cover"
57,"Agar to Williamson, 1 run can't get to the pitch as he uses his feet so resorts to nudging to the deep leg-side field"
58,"Tye to Williamson, no run short of a length at off stump, flicked to midwicket"
59,"Tye to Williamson, OUT huge wicket! Tye strikes second ball. Short of a length at off stump, Williamson looking to work into the leg side, closes the face and the ball takes a leading edge. Loops over cover, Warner turns and takes it comfortably over his shoulder"
60,"Tye to Taylor, 1 run width outside off, a slower ball, chopped to deep cover"
61,"Tye to Blundell, 1 wide a bouncer, just slips too far down the leg side"
62,"Tye to Blundell, 1 run fuller outside off, he comes forward and opens the face to run it to third man"
63,"Tye to Taylor, 1 run back of a length outside off, tapped towards point and there's some hesitation in the single but he's okay in the end"
64,"Tye to Blundell, 2 runs chips a slower ball in the air down the ground, just has the legs to clear mid-off...more good variation from Tye"

72,"Tye to Southee, OUT shuffling around the crease, it's a low full toss at 135kph, very sweetly flicked but he picks out deep square leg...taken very low by his bootlaces"
73,"Tye to de Grandhomme, 1 run pushed down the ground"
74,"Tye to Sodhi, 2 byes full outside off, a swing and miss and they run a bye to the keeper...and they are able to steal a second"
75,"Tye to Sodhi, no run another swing and a miss outside off, no byes this time"
76,"Tye to Sodhi, OUT and cleans him up with the last ball...full at off stump, Sodhi swings across the line. Tye finishes with four"
77,"New Zealand have limped to 9 for 117. It's been all Australia apart from a few blows from Colin de Grandhomme who could only face four balls in the last two overs. Billy Stanlake set the tone with pace at the top of the innings, his three early wickets setting the innings back, while Andrew Tye showed all his stills and Ashton Agar was also very"
78,"Evening all. That NZ innings was a bit of a squib... and now it's all got a bit damp at the SCG, with rain falling during the interval. Only Colin De Grandhomme (and, briefly, Tim Southee) threatened to dump on the crowd at any stage over the last hour and a half"
79,"""Only 3 fours and 3 sixes doesn't sound normal for T20, does it?"" Tells the story of New Zealand's initial struggle, Dave Fern. Once Stanlake had his early three, they couldn't really take any risks, at least until De Bigman had a pop at the end"
80,"""What's with NZ's bowling line up?! One medium-fast in Southee and spin with part-timers to make up the numbers, why not give Ferguson a crack on fast Aussie wickets?"" I think you've missed Trent Boult there, Fred? Couple of new-ball swingers and then pace off probably not the worst plan on this deck... But you'd prefer to be defending 157"
81,"""I would sure like the blackcaps to come back and win this game, that would shut up the people making fun of their batting and their accent. Not necessary."" I love their accent, toby. And their batting... but it's not been a good night for Super Smishing it"
82,"Here come the players again, bit of a soggy spectacle at the SCG - but we have a run chase. Can the Kiwis hit their straps with the ball? And Can D'Arcy Short transfer his Big Bash form to the big stage...?"
83,"Trent Boult has the new ball, two slips in"
84,"Boult to Warner, no run over the wicket, fullish length at 135kph and curving on middle and off, bunted to middwicket"
85,"Boult to Warner, no run banged in, 141kph and a touch wide, Warner swings the arms with abandon but fails to connect - looked like that zipped through"

91,"Southee to Warner, 1 run short ball, pulled hard and flat to deep square leg for one"
92,"Southee to Short, FOUR runs dug in, boshed for four! Short swivels and rams his first boundary in Australia colours to the deep midwicket fence - went like a rocket"

94,"Southee to Lynn, no run over the wicket, back of a length at 135kph and Lynn prods it down into the pitch"
95,"Boult to Warner, OUT bouncer, Warner swings it leg side... and Bruce juggles the catch smartly on the rope! Went right down his schooner but he was off balance, had to step back over the boundary, but had the presence of mind to lob it up and get back inside the playing area to complete the dismissal. Two in two for NZ and this chase has j"
96,"Boult to Lynn, no run hits a length on middle and leg, good pace, up around 140kph again and Lynn defends"
97,"Boult to Lynn, FOUR runs short, angled across, Lynn flays it over cover point... almost goes all the way! A brutal stand-and-deliver hit"
98,"Boult to Lynn, FOUR runs fired full outside off and he carves it away for four more over point, back-to-back boundaries for Lynn calm any Australia jitters"
99,"Boult to Lynn, no run goes round the wicket now, dug in short and cramping him for room, blocked to the leg side"

105,"Santner to Lynn, no run pushed through quicker again, swatted into the covers"

113,"Southee to Maxwell, FOUR runs cheekily done and Maxwell gets four! Short outside off, he sits back and ramps just clear of the keeper, bit of a thick edge, could have gone wrong... but he gets the reward"
