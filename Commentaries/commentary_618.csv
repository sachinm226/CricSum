243,He scored 10 fours and two sixes in his knock and his stand with White was worth a massive 84 off just 7.3 overs at a rate of 11.20 an over. A rude shock for the home side no doubt. The story so far has been of two of Australia's domestic warhorses who've had to wait years for the big break. Both scored at over
