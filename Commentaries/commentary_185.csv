245,"Kohli: I love to bat with Rahane. MS was charged up today. He wanted to smack a few today. On a slowish wicket, he has done a tremendous job. The guys are excited to make it 2-1. It is not an easier track to bat on."
246,Shashank will call the chase. Ciao
247,"Australia's bowlers, however, impressed, and were ably backed up by their fielders. Hastings pounded the deck and claimed his career-best ODI figures. Richardson too hurried batsmen and they tied down Dhawan. The opener scratched his way to a fifty, Rahane's was more fluent, Kohli struck 117, and Dhoni produced a cameo. But India could not cross 300. The visitors managed only 46"
248,"5:51pm: India finish with 295 for 6. It doesn't look enough, again. Their bowlers have another tough task ahead, with their batsmen not connecting with enough blows in the death."
249,"6:10pm Interesting thoughts from Wasim Akram. He reckons 295 at the MCG is worth more than it actually is, considering the dimensions of the ground. Will the Indian bowlers prove him right? The series is on the line. MS Dhoni will need a big performance from Ishant and Umesh, especially in Ashwin's absence."
250,Our stats man Bharath Seervi with another interesting nugget: Teams have posted 265+ eight times against Australia at 'The G'. The hosts have chased them down successfully on five occasions.
251,6:30pm Players are making their way out. Will MS try something different and hand the new ball to Umesh? Will he hold Sran back as the first change bowler. We'll find out very soon.
252,"Yes, Umesh it will be. Shaun Marsh on strike. Fasten your seat belts"
253,Ishant into the attack
254,"Yadav to Marsh, no run moves away from off stump, squeezed towards cover point"
255,"Yadav to Marsh, no run good delivery, length ball, closer to the stumps, Marsh hops back and plays it with soft hands"
256,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run looks to crash it through cover, ends up slicing it behind point towards third man"
257,"Yadav to Finch, 3 runs stands tall and punches it between the two cover fielders, good chase by Rahane but a weak throw. Once again a back of length delivery, good bat flow from Finch as he came down on it"
258,"Yadav to Marsh, no run turned towards mid-on this time, Marsh was hurried for pace on that occasion"
259,"Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs beautiful flow of the bat once again. Pitched up, not much movement, Marsh plants his front foot forward and essays a classic cover drive past the diving Virat Kohli at wide mid-off"
260,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run floats it full and across Finch, left alone"
261,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 2 runs hops back and plays the Natraja shot, gets it into the gap at deep backward square leg"
262,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run excellent stop by Jadeja at backward point, it was crunched but he threw himself to his left to stop that"
263,"Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 run gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg, lucky"
264,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run good delivery this time, more effort into the delivery, lands it ahead of good length around off, left alone"
265,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, FOUR runs wow! simply, wow. Half volley outside off, simply leans into the drive and eases it into the gap at cover. Sourav Ganguly would have been proud of that stroke. Nice high elbow as ball met bat, enough power. Once he found the gap, there was no stopping that"
266,"Sharma to Finch, no run another half volley outside off, this one's hit hard to Rohit at cover. Finch will be kicking himself, a boundary missed."
267,"Sharma to Finch, 1 wide nips away from outside off, Finch watches it through to Dhoni. He was flirting with the wide line, umpire thinks it was wide enough"
268,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run angled it full on middle from wide of the crease, tucked to short midwicket for a quick single"
269,"Sharma to Marsh, 3 runs sliding into the pads, easy pickings, flicked into the gap at square leg, they're back for the third quite easily, can be tough to throw on the turn here. The throw from Rohit had no power whatsoever"
270,"Sharma to Finch, no run that's closer to the stumps, just a touch around off, held its line, left alone"
271,"Sharma to Finch, no run back of length delivery on off, tapped to short cover"
272,"Sharma to Finch, no run punched to Rohit at cover, no boundary of the over. Better one for India"
273,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, 3 runs gentle half volley on the pads, superbly flicked away, long boundary there at deep midwicket, they missed an opportunity to get back for the fourth. Poor bowling"
274,"Barinder Sran to Finch, FOUR runs short, wide and four! Sitting up nicely for Finch to use the width and put that away into the gap behind point. Easy pickings at any level of cricket really"
275,"Barinder Sran to Finch, FOUR runs gentle full toss this time on off, Finch says 'thank you very much'. Leans forward, goes through the line and beats cover. No chance of stopping that"
276,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run straight in and straight out. Gurkeerat puts down a sitter at mid-off. It was right in the slot to drive, he hit it hard, he looked like grabbing that, popped out."
277,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run back of length delivery on off, left alone"
278,"Barinder Sran to Finch, no run excellent stop by Rohit, throwing himself to his right, deflected to Gurkeerat at mid-off. Saved a certain boundary"
279,"Sharma to Marsh, 1 run gentle tap to mid-off as they scamper through for a quick single. Umesh was caught napping at mid-on, shouldn't have been a run"
280,"Sharma to Finch, no run good ball, angled in on off from wide of the crease at length, left alone"
281,"Sharma to Finch, no run hits the deck hard, extra bounce, hurries onto Finch's bat as he looks to defend off the back foot"
282,"Sharma to Finch, 1 run back of length delivery on middle, tucked wide of square leg"
283,"Sharma to Marsh, FOUR runs short ball at 137 kph, enough time for Marsh to swivel and pull that one behind square. Picked the bones out of that one. Rolled his wrists to keep it down, raced away into the boundary"
284,"Sharma to Marsh, no run nips away from length area outside off, left alone"
285,"Yadav to Finch, OUT a wicket finally. The outside edge has been found courtesy some late movement. Good length, drew him forward, Finch went for the drive, but the foot was nowhere to the pitch of the ball, gets a thin edge which MS accepts gleefully. The manner in which he threw the ball up after pouching that had relief written all over it. He doesn't generally get very"
286,"Yadav to Smith, 1 wide this one is directed down leg side, some work for the umpire"
287,"Yadav to Smith, 2 runs too straight this time, tucked away wide of midwicket, off the mark with two easy runs"
288,"Yadav to Smith, no run full on middle, driven to mid-on"
289,"Yadav to Smith, no run late movement again, full on middle, Smith is slightly squared up as he defends it to mid-on"

293,"Sharma to Smith, no run punched through the line, straight to Shikhar D at cover point"
294,"Sharma to Smith, no run another punch, another stop by Shikhar"
295,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs short ball, Smith manages to get enough bat on it as he fetches the pull from outside off, beats the gap between midwicket and mid-on"
296,"Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs not all that short this time, but another pull that has split the gap on the on side. Went like a rocket. Only a batsman in the form of his life can think of playing that stroke. That Smith is in the form of his life would be an understatement"
297,"Sharma to Smith, no run prods forward half-heartedly, gets an inside edge onto the pad"
298,"Yadav to Marsh, no run beaten on the drive, played outside the line, doesn't carry to Dhoni"
299,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 leg bye beaten for pace, thuds into the thigh pad, rolls to the on side as they steal a bye"
300,"Yadav to Smith, no run full and swinging in on middle and off, Smith gets a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
301,"Yadav to Smith, no run peach of a delivery. Lands it a touch ahead of the length area on off, this one nips away just a touch, Smith is beaten as he looks to hit through the line"
302,"Yadav to Smith, FOUR runs beats the diving Jadeja at backward point. Right line, but wrong length. Too short, he unfurls his wrists superbly to beat the infield"
303,"Yadav to Smith, no run full on off, carefully defended to the off side"
304,"R Dhawan to Marsh, no run bowls a cutter to start off, short around off, kept a little low, Marsh is beaten on the pull"
305,"R Dhawan to Marsh, no run nice and full on off, driven to mid-off. Kohli effects a direct hit at the bowler's end but Smith's bat is well inside the crease. Third umpire was called for a mere formality"
306,"R Dhawan to Marsh, no run tight line, just in and around the off stump, he gets forward and plays it with soft hands"
307,"R Dhawan to Marsh, no run good chance of pace, well disguised, Marsh shaped to drive but checked his shot at the last moment, defended to the cover fielder"
308,"R Dhawan to Marsh, 2 runs width on offer this time, squeezed away behind point, Sran covers good ground from third man, dishes in a dive to pull that back in"
309,"R Dhawan to Marsh, 2 runs once again eased behind point towards Sran, excellent running between the wickets. Not a bad first over from Rishi D"
310,"Yadav to Smith, 1 run just short of Rahane at midwicket. Slice of luck for Smith. Looked to flick that past the fielder, didn't get enough bat on that. Few words exchanged between Smith and Umesh"
311,"Yadav to Marsh, 1 run hurried for pace, still manages to awkwardly whip that towards square leg"
312,"Yadav to Smith, 2 runs excellent punch again, width on offer, eased into the gap at cover point, third man had to run in to stop that"
313,"Yadav to Smith, 3 runs width on offer, eased towards third man where Sran runs around, does all the hard work but can't time his dive, parries the ball further but recovers well enough to save a run"
314,"Yadav to Marsh, 2 runs pulled handsomely in front of square this time, but there is protection in the deep"
315,"Yadav to Marsh, no run better length, a touch fuller and just around off, carefully defended off the back foot"

326,"Gurkeerat to Smith, 1 run half-stop by Rahane at midwicket gives them the single"

329,"R Dhawan to Smith, no run authoritative drive, but a diving Rohit took the pace off the ball, it deflected towards mid-off"

370,"R Dhawan to Marsh, 2 runs full outside off, squeezed into the gap behind point, back for the second to get to a fifty. Soaks in the applause of the crowd, but knows the job is just half done. 12th fifty for him"

373,"R Dhawan to Bailey, no run pushed firmly to mid-off"
374,"R Dhawan to Bailey, FOUR runs too short, sitting up nicely for him to play the pull, Dhawan comes around, does all the hard work and then falls over, in trying to push it back in, he manages to push it into the boundary instead.

382,"R Dhawan to Bailey, no run sliding down leg, tickles the pad as Dhoni stops that down leg. Stifled appeal, but more out of hope than anything else"

398,"Gurkeerat to Bailey, 1 run tossed up nicely, bit of spin on that one, driven inside-out to long off"
399,"Jadeja to Bailey, OUT beautifully bowled. Ball drifts back in, rips off the surface, turns square, ball zips past Bailey's half-hearted prod, his back foot was in the air as Dhoni collected it cleanly and whipped the bails off in a split second. He made it look so easy. His back foot was on the line. That will definitely even the scales once again. Dhoni knew immediately"
400,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run gets forward and defends"
401,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run beats the outside edge this time, square turn for Jadeja again. Dhoni whips the bails off again. He's on fire. This time, the back foot was inside the crease"

428,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run bunts it down to third man, sensible stuff"
429,"Barinder Sran to Marsh, FOUR runs beautifully struck down the ground. Poor ball and that has been easily hit back past the mid-on fielder. Lovely timing. Straight bat down to generate the power and timing"
430,"Sharma to Maxwell, FOUR runs improvisation at its best. Short ball on middle, Maxwell arches back and directs it over Dhoni's head. You can't seat a fielder for that stroke"

439,"Yadav to Marsh, no run looks to play a pull off the front foot, toe ends it to mid on"
440,"Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs that's what annoys Dhoni the most about Umesh. Short and angling down leg, he helps it on its way into the fine leg boundary. Long hop that deserved to be put away"
441,"Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs another poor ball. Result the same. Down leg side, tickled into the fine leg boundary. Umesh quickly looks away even as a helpless Dhoni gestures towards him"

451,"Yadav to Marsh, no run length ball on off, pushed to cover"
452,"Yadav to Marsh, no run appeal for lbw as the ball tails back in to hit him on leg. Mitch Marsh was rushed into that attempted flick, umpire reckons it was sliding down. Good call"
453,"Yadav to Marsh, 2 runs shows the full face of the bat and plays it down to Ishant, who makes a mess of that at mid-on, what was meant to be a dot ball is two instead. He took his eyes off the ball. Very, very poor. Kohli is livid and he has every right to be."
454,"Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 2 runs, OUT steps out and crunches that wide of mid-off, Umesh gives it chase, turns around and fires a throw towards Dhoni's end. Mitch Marsh was strolling back casually as the stumps are broken down by the Indian captain, who didn't give any hint of rushing in to take the throw at all. Within the bat of an eye lid, the next thing Mitch Marsh kn"
