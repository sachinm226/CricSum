244,"Starc to Malik, 1 run slogs the final ball and mistimes it straight to midwicket, only a single and that will get them to 149"
245,"If Pakistan can sneak in a few early wickets and expose the middle order, we will have a cracker. Join us shortly."
246,"Not a bad score but Pakistan would have been comfortable with so much more in this crucial game. The early wickets dented their plans and as a result at the end of ten overs they progressed at ODI pace, 5.5 an over and thereabouts. Jamshed provided the acceleration and Kamran Akmal gave him good support but Pakistan needed some big overs towards the end ideally."
