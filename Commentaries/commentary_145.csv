The deep square leg fielder was stationed in front of square, as a leg-side sweeper"
64,"Hasan Ali to Warner, 5 runs back of a length outside off, and that's poor cricket from Pakistan.

72,"Malik to Head, no run flat, angling into the pads. Comes forward to clip to forward square leg"
73,"Malik to Head, no run gone, is it? Skips down the track too early and Malik fires it in way outside off. Turns sharply too, so Rizwan had to move left to collect it before he could complete the stumping. Gives Head enough time to drag his foot back into the crease"

86,"Malik to Warner, no run quickish length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

90,"Junaid to Warner, 1 run and there it is! A century off 78 balls. Fullish on off stump and he plays a defensive push into the off side, not too far from the finish of Junaid's follow-through, but both he and Head take off immediately to ensure they complete the quick single with ease.

98,"Malik to Head, no run no room to cut this time, kept coming in with the angle, ends up bottom-edging into the pitch. Went too hard at it"

201,"Wahab Riaz to Head, 1 run 147ks full-toss on middle and leg. Head has a good ol' hack at it and drags it to midwicket off the inside half. Wahab working up serious pace, despite hurting his knee"
202,"Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 wide Maxwell shuffles across off, banged in short, Maxwell half-ducks, the ball flies over him. Wide called for height"
203,"Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, SIX runs 151.7ks, short and wide outside off, Maxwell, having backed away outside leg, has ample leverage to flat-bat a cut over point. Hit flat and hard for six. In the World Cup 2015 match, Maxwell unleashed the back-away-look-away cut off Wahab. This one was the back-away-look-at-the-ball cut"

209,"Amir to Head, 2 runs high short ball outside off, Head has a crack at it with the pull. Skies over midwicket. Sharjeel at deep midwicket runs across to his right, puts in the dive, but the ball eludes his reach. Long-on runs to his left and mops it up"

213,"Amir to Wade, 2 runs length ball on middle and leg, clipped away to Azam at deep midwicket. Azam picks the ball up swiftly and releases it to Amir, but the bowler does not collect the ball cleanly, messing up a run-out opportunity. Head is home at the non-striker's end and Wade pockets two"

223,"Hasan Ali to Head, SIX runs Head puts Hasan in the stands beyond midwicket. Length ball outside off, another slower one, drops down to one knee and smites a slog-sweep"
224,"Hasan Ali to Head, OUT Juggles and takes it on the third attempt. Azhar has a wry smile. Head walks back for 128, acknowledging the applause at his home ground. Full and angling away outside off, Head eyes a leg-side slog, ends up skying an overhead catch to long-off. Azhar hangs onto it.... just"
225,"Hasan Ali to Faulkner, no run Faulkner steps down the track, Hasan pulls his length back outside off and beats him. The new man slashes and does not connect"

231,"Wahab Riaz to Faulkner, FOUR runs slower bouncer outside off, Faulkner has a swat at it and top-edges it away to the right of deep square leg. Hafeez moves to his right, is lazy to bend down as he looks to scoop it back into the field of play. Instead, escorts the ball to the boundary"
232,"Wahab Riaz to Faulkner, 1 run wide yorker outside off, Faulkner can't jam it out. He calls his partner through for a bye. Handscomb makes it even as Rizwan connects with the direct hit at the striker's end"
233,"Wahab Riaz to Handscomb, OUT slower short ball on the leg stump, Handscomb does not get enough power behind the pull. He can't manufacture his own pace. Holes out to Hafeez at deep square leg running across to his left. Wahab finishes with a wicket. He has done fairly well today even as his colleagues crashed and burned"
234,"Hasan Ali to Starc, 1 run yorker on off, Starc can only squeeze it through cover"
235,"Hasan Ali to Faulkner, FOUR runs full and outside off, Faulkner lays into it, smearing a drive wide of sweeper"

245,"Amir to Faulkner, 1 run very full on middle, whipped or rather toe-ended to short fine leg"
246,Only two Pakistan bowlers have conceded 100 runs in an ODI.
247,"But look away from the scorecard if you're a bowler. Hasan became the second Pakistan bowler to concede 100 in ODIs, Amir and Junaid were also attacked by Warner. Wahab worked up some serious pace and briefly held his own. Right then, Pakistan need to nail the highest chase on Australian soil if they're to win this. KK will be back with you for the start of the second innings."
248,"5.50pm David Warner ran up his sixth ODI century in his last 11 innings to underpin Australia's hefty total. Travis Head, who hit his maiden ODI century, partnered him at the top in a 284-run stand, the highest for any wicket for Australia in this format. When Warner shifted through the gears, 400 seemed likely, but a clatter of wickets in the death overs as restricted Australia to 369."
249,Here's Babar Azam
250,"Starc to Azhar Ali, no run full-toss, and that must hurt. Fast, at the batsman, and swinging in late. Looks to flick it hurriedly and only manages an inside-edge onto the inside of his left thigh"

252,"Starc to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs another full-toss, low, but this one is way outside off stump. Azhar reaches out, meets it with a horizontal bat, and stabs it to the right of the diving Maxwell at backward point"
253,"Starc to Azhar Ali, OUT gone! Full, swinging in, and it's so hard to drag your front leg away from those. He's forced to play across it, misses it by a long way, and he doesn't bother reviewing. I'd like to see ball-tracking anyway - seemed like there was just a bit of a chance it may have swung down the leg side. Nope. Hitting the middle of leg stump, it says"
254,"Starc to Babar Azam, no run fullish, close to off stump, defended to mid-off, shows the full face"
255,"Starc to Babar Azam, 1 run very full, wide of off, opens his bat face to jab it to third man"

260,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run is that another lbw? Simon Fry says no. Full, and from that angle it needs to be full to get the left-hander. Nope, pitching outside leg and probably missing too. Looks to flick it and the swing beats his edge"
261,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, no run full on off stump, jabbed to mid-on"
262,"Hazlewood to Sharjeel, FOUR runs shot! That's a length ball, but he's offered just a bit of width, and he sets himself up on a lovely stable base and lets his arms flow through the line of the ball to send it racing between cover and mid-off"

291,"Cummins to Sharjeel, no run full on off stump, driven back straight and Cummins asks for a run-out. He thinks he's got a hand on it to deflect the ball into the stumps.
