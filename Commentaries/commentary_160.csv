0,1.00pm Australia win the toss and elect to bat
1,"Shami to Finch, no run full outside off to start, no swing, driven hard to mid-off. Not great timing."
2,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs creamed. Swing for Shami, overpitched and wide outside off. Finch strides forward and nails his square drive through point."
3,"Shami to Finch, no run full delivery outside off, seaming back in, left alone"
4,"Shami to Finch, 1 run there are signs already of low bounce. Short and wide outside off, Finch cuts, his under-edge goes towards Dhoni who can't stop the ball cleanly. Bounced awkwardly in front of him too."
5,"Shami to Warner, no run tight line, around middle and leg, defended into the leg side"
6,"Shami to Warner, no run short and wide, a touch of width, chopped into the cover region. Not going to be easy to execute cross-batted strokes with variable bounce"
7,"Yadav to Finch, no run nice start from Umesh, full and wide outside off, plenty of away shape. 133 kph, lands well short of Dhoni. Not good signs these"
8,"Yadav to Finch, no run carries at ankle height this time. Full and wide outside off, left alone. Just a hint of away shape"
9,"Yadav to Finch, 2 runs races away down to fine leg. Nothing wrong with this outfield. On the pads. and Finch flicks away down to fine leg. Shami races to his right to save two. Good running too"
10,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run a thick outside edge down to third man. Full outside off, Finch plays the line. Umesh gets some away movement"
11,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run ooh, sloppy from Kohli. Good length outside off, punched towards Kohli at cover who gets to his left but fumbles, allowing a run"
12,"Yadav to Finch, no run full and straight, skewed to midwicket with a closed bat face"
13,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs beautiful. Just a straight bat and put away. That is the right length for the overhead conditions but the wrong length for this pitch. Full outside off, checking if there is swing. Hardly any, and Warner can drive through mid-off"
14,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs on the pads this time, adjusts his length, but the line isn't great. Clipped through square leg."
15,"Shami to Warner, no run fullish length around middle, the perfect length, Warner doesn't know whether to come forward or go back. A thick inside edge hits his pad"
16,"Shami to Warner, no run fullish outside off, defended into the cover region"
17,"Shami to Warner, no run full on off, Warner runs at the bowler and clips him away to mid-on. Trying to put Shami off his length."
18,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs a thick outside edge and no catching up with that on this outfield. Full and wide, Warner plays the line, but some angle takes the ball away, taking the edge. Wide of gully and too fine for a square third man."
19,"Yadav to Finch, no run ooh, that's tripe. Short and wide, swinging away. Finch wants to hammer through the line, without feet movement, chopped back up the pitch"
20,"Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs that's a lot, lot better. Just timed away. Short and wide, Finch watches the ball onto his bat, transfers his weight into the ball and punches his push through extra cover"
21,"Yadav to Finch, no run adjusts his line straightaway. Straighter and fullish, worked into the leg side"
22,"Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs poor delivery. India's new ball bowlers looking very rusty. A slower delivery on the pads, flicked through square leg for four. Focussed on timing, not power."
23,"Yadav to Finch, 1 wide drifts down leg this time, wide. 137 kph, Umesh struggling. Bowling two lengths and two lines"
24,"Yadav to Finch, no run good length on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
25,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run another awful delivery. Short and very wide, Finch can't connect cleanly with his cut, the ball trickles towards mid-off"
26,"Shami to Finch, no run full outside off, Finch drives hard into the ground towards cover"
27,"Shami to Finch, no run full and straight, pushed to mid-on. Finch wants one, but quick singles are not easy here because of the pace of the outfield."
28,"Shami to Finch, no run excellent from Shami, much much better. Fuller than a good length is the perfect length to most batsmen, Finch in particular who likes to stay back. Defended back"
29,"Shami to Finch, no run width. Not a lot, which means Finch can only go at it with an angled bat (45 degrees as opposed to the routine 90), and finds a short point"
30,"Shami to Finch, no run terrific over so far. On a length outside off, forcing Finch to defend"
31,"Shami to Finch, no run maiden for Shami. India's best over so far. Full outside off, Finch strides forward and drives to mid-off. Found his length there, helped by a good field from Kohli/Dhoni"
32,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs 141 kph, Umesh is too full and as soon as it is, Warner goes over the infield. Full outside off, Warner gets under the length and lifts the ball comfortably over mid-off. Not great timing but enough"
33,"Yadav to Warner, no run drags his length back right away. That's where he should have been off the first ball. Full on off, defended towards cover"
34,"Yadav to Warner, 1 leg bye a slower ball, drifts down leg, wayward line again, 118 kph, off the pad down to fine leg"
35,"Yadav to Finch, no run good from Umesh. On a length around off, blocked back. Keep it there for the rest of the over, make Finch make the play"
36,"Yadav to Finch, no run oh no, short and wide at 127 kph, Finch doesn't find his timing but finds cover with a slap"
37,"Yadav to Finch, 1 wide drifts down leg for a wide, 130 kph"
38,"Yadav to Finch, 1 run hurries Finch for pace. A nice short ball down leg, Finch is late on his pull, gloves it down to fine leg"
39,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs that raced away. 141 kph, full delivery on off, Finch wants to go over mid-off but the ball skews off the inside half through square leg."
40,"Shami to Finch, 1 run Australia have respected that length, why move from there? Good length outside off, sliced towards backward point where Pandey dives to his left"
41,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs poor delivery. Short on middle and leg, pulled away merrily through square leg. Too easy"
42,"Shami to Warner, no run 146 kph, full around off, driven away towards Kohli at cover. India chasing the game already"
43,"Shami to Warner, no run 139 kph, digs this in short on off, Warner think of pulling but bails out late."
44,"Shami to Warner, no run a yorker to finish, 142 kph, pushed back to the bowler."
45,"Yadav to Finch, no run late movement. Full outside off, Finch goes chasing but luckily for him, doesn't catch up with it. Beaten on the edge"
46,"Yadav to Finch, no run full outside off, defended into the cover region"
47,"Yadav to Finch, no run a slower ball around off, defended into the cover region. Dug that in, sat up"
48,"Yadav to Finch, no run good length around off, pushed away towards mid-on"
49,"Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs guided down to the third man boundary. A slower ball outside off, Finch opens his bat face and guides the ball down to the third man boundary. Nicely played"
50,"Yadav to Finch, no run full and straight, worked away to midwicket"
51,"Shami to Warner, no run a slower ball around off, driven to Kohli at cover who has an unnecessary throw at the bowler's end. Softening the ball"
52,"Shami to Warner, no run good length, around middle and off, pushed to Kohli again. No run there"
53,"Shami to Warner, no run a slower ball outside off, carved away to extra cover"
54,"Shami to Warner, no run short on middle and leg, a half pull to square leg. Well played, kept it down"
55,"Shami to Warner, 1 run a slower delivery on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
56,"Shami to Finch, no run good length outside off, punched to cover from the crease."
57,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs that was poor. Short and wide from Umesh, chopped away to point. Pandey runs to his left and lets it go, Pandya runs to his right and lets it go. The ball goes through for four."
58,"Yadav to Warner, FOUR runs in the gap this time, short and wide outside off, powered through cover for four. Just a slap"

68,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run short on middle and off, driven back to the bowler from the crease"

70,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run short and wide outside off, nailed away to the sweeper cover"
71,"Hardik to Finch, FOUR runs beautifully played. A shortish delivery outside off, not very pacey, Finch stands back and drills a drive through cover. No chance for the sweeper cover running around"
72,"Hardik to Finch, 1 run a shortish delivery on the pads, nudged to midwicket"
73,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run superbly hit, but mid-off does well. Good length outside off, pushed through cover, Umesh runs around to his right"
74,"Hardik to Finch, no run 133 kph, good length outside off, defended"
75,"Hardik to Finch, 1 run smashed through cover again, a slower delivery. The cover fielder gets around this time"

79,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run quick outside off, still no turn, played towards point"

83,"Hardik to Warner, no run full and straight, the ball moving in, driven back to the bowler"
84,"Hardik to Warner, 1 wide another poor delivery, starts it too straight, drifts down leg. Dhoni stops the ball but rolls over it as he falls over. Ouch"

86,"Hardik to Finch, no run good length around off, outside-edged towards point"

89,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run flat and straight again, nudged to midwicket"
90,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run short outside off, defended watchfully. Tight lines these from Axar"
91,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run the big reverse sweep. Flat on middle, Warner switches his stance, not his hands, finds third man"
92,"Axar Patel to Warner, SIX runs picks the length early and smashed. Short on middle, Warner picks the length early and nails his pull over midwicket. Six"
93,"Axar Patel to Warner, FOUR runs that's Warner's fifty. Short and wide from Axar, Warner sits back and crashes a cut through point. Too easy"

102,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run shortish around off, pulled down to long-on"
103,"Chahal to Finch, 1 leg bye short down leg, off the pad down to short fine leg. Already going on the defensive in terms of flight"
104,"Chahal to Warner, no run short outside off, pushed away to cover"
105,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run lots of flight on that outside off, driven to long-off"
106,"Chahal to Finch, no run good end, quick on leg, pushed back to the bowler and that will be drinks"
107,"Hardik to Warner, FOUR runs overpitched on off stump, and that's a good stop from Umesh at long-off, sprinting hard and sliding to his left after Warner shows it the full face and sends it racing towards the boundary. Is it a clean save, or has his foot touched the rope? Replays indicate it's the latter. Still, a good effort from the fast bowler"
108,"Hardik to Warner, no run back of a length, angling across towards off stump, chopped down towards short cover"
109,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run full, a fair bit outside off stump this time. Warner eases it away towards deep point after shuffling across"
110,"Hardik to Finch, 2 runs full, a lot of width, Finch throws his hands at it and opens his bat face slightly to get the placement he desires, a fair distance to the left of Axar at sweeper cover"
111,"Hardik to Finch, no run length ball outside off stump, presses forward to drive towards cover. Was in the air for a moment, but he was more or less in control of his shot"
112,"Hardik to Finch, 1 run goes wide of the crease to angle a length ball towards off stump. Finch shows the full face and pushes it down the ground, past the diving bowler, and mid-off moves right to stop it"
113,"Chahal to Finch, 1 wide flat, angling down leg. Finch can't get bat on it as he tries to glance"
114,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked away to the left of short fine leg"
115,"Chahal to Warner, SIX runs tossed up on leg stump, and Warner gets down low, front leg planted just next to the line, to slog-sweep hard and flat over midwicket"
116,"Chahal to Warner, no run quicker ball on middle and off, defended without too much footwork back to the bowler"
117,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs goes back to a length ball that's only inches outside off stump and plays a controlled cut through cover point. Most batsmen would have played that off the front foot, into the covers"
118,"Chahal to Warner, no run slows it down and gets some turn, rips in and hits the pad as he comes half-forward to defend. Clearly headed down leg, so not much of an appeal"
119,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run flat, back of a length, goes back and works it off his pads through square leg"
120,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run back of a length, turning in towards middle and off, defended to midwicket"
121,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run length ball, goes on the back foot again, Axar gives him no room and he clips towards midwicket"
122,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run a bit slower on off stump, gets forward to push down the ground, towards long-on, and Axar moves quickly to his left to intercept"
123,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run down the track now, gets to the pitch of a slightly tossed-up off-stump ball and whips to long-on"
124,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run length ball angled in towards off stump, slightly lower arm on this. Defended towards point"
125,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run flat, and he goes back, plays the trajectory rather than the actual length, which isn't short enough to pull. Inside-edges it and drags it a short distance into the leg side. Could easily have played on there"
126,"Chahal to Warner, SIX runs down the track and that's six more. Not much Chahal can do about this. He looked to bowl it a little shorter, at his body, and not give him swinging room, and he just clears his front leg and swats it away over square midwicket"
127,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run full on off stump, driven to long-off"
128,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run length ball pitching on middle and turning away, makes room and slaps it away to sweeper cover, past Kohli, who moves to his left from extra-cover but doesn't get down in time to stop it"
129,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs a tiny bit of width, and Warner makes a bit more room and slaps it away, off the back foot, through backward point"
130,"Chahal to Warner, no run flat on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
131,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run tossed up slower, lands on a good length on middle stump and turns into Warner, who gets forward to work it through square leg"
132,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run flat length ball on off stump, goes back and across to work it to square leg"
133,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run down the track to one bowled slightly slower on off stump. Doesn't get to the pitch, punches it back to the bowler"
134,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run fired in flat, angling slightly down leg. Nowhere near short enough to pull - he was looking to turn it around the corner with a horizontal-ish bat - and he's hit on the pad. Not the loudest lbw appeal, he knew it was heading down leg"
135,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run flat again, on the stumps, clipped down the ground to long-on"
136,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run flat length ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
137,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run angled in with a lower arm, pitches just back of a length. Goes back to punch to short cover"
138,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run back of a length outside off, chopped down towards backward point"
139,"Chahal to Finch, 4 byes Finch misses, Dhoni misses, and that runs away for four byes. Looked to clear his front leg and launch that over mid-on, and the ball turned less than he expected. Went between bat and pad, and his back leg dragged itself out of the crease. The lack of turn has beaten Dhoni too - a missed stumping."
140,"Chahal to Finch, no run length ball on off stump, driven to short cover"
141,"Chahal to Finch, no run flat length ball on middle stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
142,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run on the pads, clipped quietly towards backward square leg"
143,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run short, wide, slapped to deep point"
144,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run flat length ball on leg stump - he saw Warner setting up to make himself room. Punched into the covers"
145,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 wide now he expects Warner to make that premeditated movement and fires it down the leg side. Warner stays where he is and it's called wide"
146,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run fired in flat again. Warner moves away from the stumps first, and then moves across to try and play a half-forward sweep. Misses. is hit on the pad, but it's going down leg"
147,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run flat length ball on middle stump, clipped towards midwicket"
148,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run a touch shorter outside off, chopped into the covers"
149,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run"
150,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
151,"Chahal to Warner, no run steps out but goes too early. Chahal tosses it wide of off stump and he reaches out to stab it to backward point"
152,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run length ball, closer to off stump, punched down the ground to long-off"
153,"Chahal to Finch, no run tossed up on the pads, lands very full. Clipped to short fine leg"
154,"Chahal to Finch, 2 runs sees Finch looking to make room and slows it up a lot, floats it up gently. Doesn't have the pace to go over cover, so drags a sweep out to deep square leg instead, brings up fifty"
155,"Chahal to Finch, no run flat, back of a length on leg stump, cramps Finch for room and he punches to short extra"
156,"Chahal to Finch, no run again Finch makes a premeditated move away from leg stump. Slows it up gently and follows him outside leg. Not full enough for the drive so he looks to defend, and the ball turns past his outside edge and somehow misses leg stump."
157,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run flat, fired down leg. Looks to clip it round the corner, misses. Big appeal from Dhoni - maybe a bit of pad on the way through"
158,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run flat and full on off stump, clipped through square leg"
159,"Axar Patel to Finch, SIX runs full on off stump, and Finch finally executes a shot he's been trying to play for a while. Unlike Chahal, Axar gives him some pace to work with, and he makes just a bit of room to loft that inside-out over cover"
160,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run flat, back of a length, angling into middle stump. Makes a bit of room and punches it past the diving bowler to long-off"
161,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run again, looks to cramp Warner by firing it flat onto his pads. Makes room and punches to long-off"
162,"Axar Patel to Finch, FOUR runs flat, angling down leg, and it's a touch short too. Finch just needs a little bit of bat on this, and he manages it, just helps it away down to the fine leg boundary"
163,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run tossed up outside off. Stretches out and plays a wristy flick-sweep through backward square leg"
164,"Chahal to Finch, FOUR runs floats this down the leg side, and that's not a great ball with fine leg up. Sweeps it in the air, to the left of that fielder, and picks up four more"
165,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run back of a length, pitching on off stump and turning away. Stops on Finch slightly as he goes on the back foot. Adjusts and whips it down to long-on"
166,"Chahal to Warner, no run tossed up outside off. Gets on the front foot and clips to short fine leg, with the turn"
167,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run back of a length, turning in towards off and middle. Chopped away into the cover-point region"
168,"Chahal to Finch, SIX runs flighted, and it's not the greatest ball. Lands right in Finch's slot outside off, gives him ample room to swing freely through the line and launch it cleanly over the long-off boundary"
169,"Hardik to Warner, no run length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to backward point"
170,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, pushes gently into the covers and calls his partner through for a single"
171,"Hardik to Finch, 1 leg bye back of a length, a bit of inward nip too as Finch walks across, looking to work it into the leg side. Misses, hit on the pad, but it's probably a touch high. Not much of an appeal as it runs away into the square-leg region for a leg bye"
172,"Hardik to Warner, 2 runs back of a length close to off stump, punched away to the right of Rahane at deep point. Bit of a misfield, the result of the batsmen putting pressure on him by pushing for two"
173,"Hardik to Warner, 1 run length ball close to off stump, punched down the ground to long-off"
174,"Hardik to Finch, 1 run slower length ball angling in towards off stump. Presses forward, lets it come on, and dabs into the backward point region"
175,"Chahal to Finch, no run back of a length on the pads, clipped to short fine leg"
176,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run flat, short, wide, slapped to the left of deep point"
177,"Chahal to Warner, no run back of a length, sharp turn in from wide of off, punched into the covers"
178,"Chahal to Warner, no run tossed up along that wide line again. Chases it with the attempted flat-bat drive and inside-edges into the ground and then towards the keeper. Again some turn from that line"
179,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run shorter now, slapped away to deep point"
180,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
181,"Axar Patel to Finch, FOUR runs shot! That's a flat length ball angled into middle and leg, not much turn. Just gets down low, leaning backwards to make a bit more room, and helps it away with a flat bat to the left of short fine leg"
182,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run length ball, looks to get forward and play down the ground, gets a little inside edge that rolls into the leg side"
183,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
184,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run tossed up higher on off stump, driven hard but straight back to the bowler"
185,"Axar Patel to Warner, 2 runs on the pads, tucked away through backward square leg. Throw from Shami, who runs in from the boundary, hits the stumps on the full at the bowler's end, and deflects away for an overthrow"
186,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run back of a length, turns in towards the pads, worked away through square leg"
187,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run back of a length, angling into off stump, flat-batted down to long-off for one"
188,"Jadhav to Finch, no run ooh, that's a round-arm Malinga outswinger at the speed of a jalopy. Looks to punch into the covers, with no feet, and the ball beats his outside edge"
189,"Jadhav to Finch, 1 run this one's angling down leg and short fine leg dives right to stop a firm, standing sweep. Hardik the fielder"
190,"Jadhav to Warner, no run shortish outside off, slapped straight to backward point."
191,"Jadhav to Warner, FOUR runs round-arm, very wide of off, and he takes a big step back and across and stabs it away to the right of the diving backward point to bring up his 14th ODI hundred. What a way to celebrate your 100th ODI."
192,"Jadhav to Warner, no run back of a length on off stump, punched to extra-cover. Wanted the single to long-off, but Rohit dived left to intercept"
193,"Axar Patel to Finch, 2 runs back of a length outside off, punched to the left of sweeper cover"
194,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
195,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run down the track and Axar looks to cramp him by firing it at his pads. Flicks it round to short fine leg"
196,"Axar Patel to Finch, no run length ball wide of off, a bit slower. Early into the flat-bat slap and he hits it to extra-cover"
197,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 run back of a length this time, and he doesn't quite get the room he wants. Again a flat-bat slap straight to extra-cover"
198,"Axar Patel to Warner, 1 run back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room to flat-bat to long-off"
199,"Jadhav to Warner, no run flat, angling into the pads, clipped to square leg"
200,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run slow, round-arm, short and wide. It's absolutely filthy but all he can do with it is slap it to deep point"
201,"Jadhav to Finch, no run slow again, angling down leg. Sweeps hard, and ends up hitting straight to short fine leg"
202,"Jadhav to Finch, 1 run fuller, on the pads, swept to the left of short fine leg but deep backward square leg is pretty fine too, just has to move a short distance to his right to stop it"
203,"Jadhav to Warner, no run back of a length outside off, slapped to extra-cover"
204,"Jadhav to Warner, 1 run again flat and short, slapped to the left of sweeper cover"
205,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run shortish, wide of off, slapped to point"
206,"Axar Patel to Warner, SIX runs flat, full, angling into leg stump, and Warner's hit the roof! Just clears his front leg and swings his entire body through a mighty swipe over wide long-on. It was this close to clearing the roof and going out of the ground"
207,"Axar Patel to Warner, 2 runs back of a length outside off, slapped away through cover"
208,"Axar Patel to Warner, FOUR runs flat length ball wide of off, and he goes on the back foot - most batsmen would have gone forward to that - and flat-bats it with immense power to beat sweeper cover diving futilely to his left"
209,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run quicker ball, short and well wide of off stump. Jumps across to cut but can't connect"
210,"Axar Patel to Warner, FOUR runs shortish, closer to off stump this time, and Warner puts it away clinically. Waits on it, and then chops it away at the perfect moment to place it unstoppably to the right of the overworked off-side sweeper"

216,"Jadhav to Warner, OUT flat, shortish, angling into leg stump, and Jadhav has broken the partnership! The low release means there isn't too much bounce. Clears his front leg and looks to heave it over wide long-on, but it skids on and he hits it straighter than he'd like, and doesn't get the power he'd like, ends up hitting it straight to long-on"

220,"Yadav to Finch, no run on the pads, Finch misses a flick, clips the pad en route to the keeper. Too leg side ish"
221,"Yadav to Finch, OUT looks to clobber it, such bad timing that mid-on takes a sitter. A slower ball outside off, Finch looks to drag the ball from well outside off, but it's right off the toe end, and straight to mid-on. So wide that it may have been a wide had Finch let that go"
222,"Yadav to Smith, 1 run gets a gentle full toss on the pads and Smith works the ball through square leg. Great over from Umesh"

230,"Yadav to Smith, OUT chipped into the hands of midwicket. Australia are falling apart quickly. On the pads from Umesh, Smith gets outside the line and just clips it into the hands of midwicket, where Kohli is lurking. This game turning around quickly again"
231,"Yadav to Handscomb, 2 runs nicely whipped away. Too straight from Umesh and Handscomb flicks away past midwicket for a couple. Played that along the ground"
232,"Yadav to Handscomb, 1 run full and straight again, nudged down to fine leg for one"

242,"Jadhav to Head, 1 run short and wide again, cut to deep point for one"
243,"Shami to Head, no run awful shot selection. A good length delivery outside off, Head tries to pull through midwicket, nowhere close to contact"

258,"Chahal to Head, no run tossed up outside off, awkwardly played back towards the bowler who stops a run with a dive to his left"
259,"Chahal to Head, FOUR runs short, wide and cut away. Drops too short there does Chahal, Head rocks back and cuts past cover for four"

262,"Jadhav to Head, no run short and quick, pushed back. Head consuming far too many"
263,"Jadhav to Head, no run another dot ball. Short and wide, tripe, slashed but finds point. The big shot not far away"
264,"Jadhav to Head, 1 run cut to the deep point fielder"
265,"Jadhav to Handscomb, FOUR runs that's how it should be treated. A low full toss from Jadhav, Handscomb stays low and nails his slog sweep to the deep square leg boundary."
266,"Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run short and wide, so slow, Handscomb stays back and punches to the sweeper cover"
267,"Jadhav to Head, no run another dot. Head is 16 off 27. Quick and straight, whipped to midwicket"

271,"Shami to Handscomb, no run full and straight again, whipped to midwicket. Off the inside half of the bat"
272,"Shami to Handscomb, no run good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, cut towards point. Just losing so much momentum here"

274,"Yadav to Handscomb, 1 run short on middle and leg, pulled down to fine leg. Just one"

276,"Yadav to Head, 1 run just short of third man. Full and wide outside off, Head looks to go over cover but can't make good enough contact. A thick outside edge lands in front of the fielder"
277,"Yadav to Handscomb, 2 runs just over midwicket. Full on leg, so badly timed that Kohli has enough time to jog around from long-on and cut it off. A fantastic dive from Kohli, saves two more. Placed well by Handscomb"
278,"Yadav to Handscomb, 1 run a full slower delivery on middle, driven to long-on"
279,"Yadav to Head, no run a slog that trickles to midwicket. All the momentum of this innings has been sucked out. A short, slow ball outside off, Head badly times this to midwicket. He has to stay till the end and make up"

285,"Shami to Head, 2 leg byes a big appeal, Head is not fussed about the appeal and races back for a couple as the ball trickles to Axar at third man. Good running. That was quite close, as Head missed a big heave and was struck in front of leg."
286,"Shami to Head, 1 run another slower ball outside off, awkwardly pulled towards midwicket"
287,"Yadav to Head, 1 wide full and very wide outside off, Head stretched out but can't reach it, wide"

290,"Yadav to Handscomb, 1 run a short and wide legcutter, Handscomb finds deep point with a cut. Wonder if he could have done a lot more with that, place it wide, play it late"
291,"Yadav to Head, 2 runs just short of Rahane, who over-runs it but recovers well. A slow bouncer on middle and off, Head reaches out and flat-bats a forehand behind square leg for two"
292,"Yadav to Head, 1 wide full and very wide outside off, left alone, wide called"

312,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run shortish and wide, sliced to point for a run. Good finish that from Stoinis"
313,"4.58pm All in all, that's quite a fine innings from Australia. But depending on which camp you are in, you'd be a little disappointed or slightly happy with that total of 334. When Warner and Finch were going, it looked like Australia were set for 360, maybe more. But India pulled it back nicely in the end through wickets. These are short boundaries, and a decent surface, and a fine batting unit."

318,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
319,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run back of a length, a hint of inward movement towards off stump. Lets it come on and pushes to the right of mid-on with a straight bat"

321,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run back of a length, much closer to off stump this time. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands towards backward point"
322,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, no run nice length, and he gets a bit of outswing too. Started it a bit wider to entice Rohit into a drive away from his body, but he just ignores it"
323,"Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, 1 run shortish, some width again. Reaches out and stabs it to third man"
324,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the dabbed single to third man but the ball stops on him and hits the inside edge and ricochets towards his feet"
325,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run length ball, fifth-stump line, a tiny bit of shape away. Rahane leaves it alone"

333,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run back of a length on off stump, defends it back to the bowler"
334,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run oh man. That ball sneaks past the thigh pad as Rahane attempts a little glance towards fine leg, and it just misses off stump. That's how far across the stumps he moved in premeditation"
335,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, SIX runs bang! He can play these sorts of shots when he's in the mood, and the ball was right there for it. So much width, just back of a length, and he takes a step forward and slaps it up and over cover point"

337,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, no run fullish outside off, and again Rahane flows forward, this time for a crisp drive to mid-off"
338,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run ooh, risky shot. It's back of a length, angling into middle stump or thereabouts, and he gets a premeditated stride in, forward and across, looking for a scoop over short fine leg. Misses, and it hits his thigh pad. Too short for an lbw, so the appeal isn't particularly confident"
339,"Cummins to Rahane, FOUR runs oh man, he's really timing it today. It's shortish, and it's on a fourth-stump line. A pretty decent ball, but he just stays leg-side of it, deliberately, opens his bat face, and sends it racing away to the right of third man"
340,"Cummins to Rahane, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
341,"Cummins to Rahane, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended towards backward point. He was looking for one but it went to the fielder too quickly for that"

354,"Kane Richardson to Rahane, FOUR runs now it's Rahane's turn to pull. Short ball just outside off stump, and he puts it away over straight midwicket. I think he was waiting for that length, and he pounced as soon as he spotted one slightly short"
355,"Kane Richardson to Rahane, 1 run back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and dabs into the point region"
356,"Stoinis to Rahane, FOUR runs and he starts with a short, wide, rubbish ball that Rahane cracks away through point with a flashing square-cut"

416,"Head to Kohli, FOUR runs fantastic batting. Stoinis labours after it, puts in a dive but can't haul it in. Short outside off, plays the late cut very very late and gets it past short third man"

419,"Head to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full on the pads again, driven to long-on"
420,"Head to Kohli, 1 run dropped! It's a half-chance, but Australia need to take those. Short outside off, the ball turning in, Kohli stays in his crease and nervously pokes at it, off the toe end to Head's left in his follow-through. He gets there but drops the chance."
421,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run full and straight, Kohli runs at the bowler and mis-times a drive to the sweeper cover"
422,"Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run good length around off, nudged towards square leg"
423,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run a very risky stroke, but he plays it quite well. Short outside off, Kohli chops it down to third man. Always the risk of chopping on too, like game 2 in Kolkata"

432,"Head to Rohit Sharma, no run full outside off, nudged to midwicket"
433,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, FOUR runs that bottom hand again. Full and straight, Kohli steps out and whips the ball through midwicket, between midwicket and mid-on. Just that bottom-hand power"

437,"Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run full on off and middle, driven to long-on"
438,"Kane Richardson to Kohli, OUT and Rohit is run-out! Steven Smith makes the run-out with a sensational dive. A short delivery outside off, Kohli guides the ball down to backward point, where Smith dives away to his left to stop the ball. He then has a throw at the batsman's end, where Rohit and Kohli are both vying to make the crease. Head is backing up at midwicket, picks up, and throws th"

441,"Head to Hardik, 1 run full and straight, driven to long-on"

443,"Head to Kohli, 1 run nudged to long-on"
444,"Head to Hardik, SIX runs yikes, watch out those snoozing in the high stands. Flight on off, Pandya gets underneath the delivery and nails his slog sweep waaaaaaay over wide long-on. Massive"
445,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run good length outside off, chopped back to the bowler, didn't time that"
446,"Coulter-Nile to Kohli, OUT happens again. Kohli has done it again, it was always going to happen and I think Coulter-Nile was playing for that. Good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, Kohli tries to dab this down to third man, but it takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. That's another error from Kohli, and the worst thing is he has repeated the mistake from Kolkata. It"

457,"Coulter-Nile to Hardik, 2 runs lovely whip past midwicket. Full and straight, Pandya clips the ball past the fielder. Cummins puts in a boundary-saving dive running around from deep square leg. Should have been three"
458,"Coulter-Nile to Hardik, no run full outside off, driven to mid-off. Staying slightly leg side of the ball, which is the right way to play the ball coming in"

465,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run fine stop from Richardson at third man. Short and wide, Jadhav cuts that into the gap. The fielder saves three"
466,"Zampa to Hardik, SIX runs clears midwicket. It's just slightly short outside off, Pandya stays in his crease and nails his whipped jab over midwicket. How did he get so much power behind that?"
467,"Zampa to Hardik, SIX runs and again. Zampa bowls this wider outside off, tempting Pandya, who says I have a wide repertoire and drills a hard drive over cover. Keeps going and clears the boundary easily"
468,"Zampa to Hardik, no run flat end, towards off, dabbed towards point"
469,"Cummins to Jadhav, 1 run good length on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
470,"Cummins to Hardik, no run full outside off, defended towards cover"
471,"Cummins to Hardik, no run on the pads, 146 kph, seams back in. Pandya gets to the ball late, and is clattered on the thigh pad, just under the actual protection."
472,"Cummins to Hardik, no run good length outside off, carved towards backward point"
473,"Cummins to Hardik, 1 run full outside off, pushed away towards extra cover for one. Think he feels he is set"

480,"Stoinis to Hardik, 1 run finely played. Good length outside off, a deft dab to third man. Pandya wants two and Jadhav doesn't. At least, it was a loud clear call"

482,"Cummins to Jadhav, no run good length outside off, played to Smith at backward point"
483,"Cummins to Jadhav, 1 run full around off, Jadhav comes down the pitch and shovels a flick to square leg for one"

491,"Stoinis to Jadhav, no run comes down the pitch, looking to hit that straight but the ball skews off the inside edge into the pad"

507,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run length ball angling in towards off stump, defended towards point and they sprint through for a quick single. That man Smith has dived in and flicked a direct hit at the keeper's end, but Pandya was well home by then"
508,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, FOUR runs overpitched on leg stump, and Pandya just needs to place that. He does that nicely, flicks it away into the big gap to the left of long leg"
509,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, no run slower ball outside off, and it beats Pandya, who opens his bat face and looks to guide it down to third man"
510,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, no run back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the pushed single but extra-cover charges forward, towards the ball to deny him"
511,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, no run back of a length outside off, dabbed to short third man - was maybe looking to beat him to his left"
512,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, no run length ball on off stump, punched to short extra-cover"

523,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run back of a length outside off, Jadhav shuffles forward even before the bowler releases, opens his bat face, and stabs to backward point. He's right on the edge of the circle, so they run a fairly comfortable single"
524,"Kane Richardson to Hardik, 1 run fullish on off stump, and this time mid-off is right on the edge of the 30-yard circle, so they run a single despite Pandya driving straight to the man"

528,"Zampa to Jadhav, no run ooh, good ball. And they've gone to the third umpire for a stumping appeal! Goes back to a length ball and he's beaten trying to late-cut. A bit of extra bounce on that. He didn't move out of the crease, but momentarily moved his back foot forward - he dragged it rather than lift it, however, and he's pretty much safe"

530,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, no run sees Jadhav stepping out and bowls it short outside off. Hops to ride the bounce, and dabs towards backward point"

532,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, no run down the track again. This time he shortens his length and angles it into the body, cramping Jadhav for room. Drops it down into the pitch with soft hands, but no chance of a quick single"
533,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, 1 run shuffles out of his crease again, and this time he gets the wide length ball, which he guides down to third man with an open bat face"
534,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, 1 leg bye shortish, angling into the body, and he tucks it off his hip into the square leg region. Loses his footing as he sets off for a single, and he stumbles onto the floor and loses his bat before finally managing to jog to the other end"
535,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, no run length ball outside off, pushed towards extra-cover"
536,"Zampa to Pandey, no run goes back to a length ball on middle and off, and it straightens rather than turn away sharply. Jams his bat down to defend into the off side - it was very nearly back pad before bat"

548,"Zampa to Pandey, FOUR runs down the track comes Pandey, and Zampa is under pressure at the start of the over. Some flight, wide of off stump, and he gets underneath it and drives inside-out over cover"
549,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 leg bye a touch short, angling down leg. Not short enough to pull. Looks to help it fine but can't put bat to ball. Only hits his upraised front pad, and rolls away for a leg bye towards fine leg. Belatedly, Smith as decided to review for lbw, but no way is that lbw. I haven't even seen the replays,and I know impact was outside leg stump and it was missing leg by a lon"

551,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 run flat, short, and he goes deep in his crease to whip-pull to deep backward square leg. Wasn't quite short enough for the full-blooded arms-extended pull"
552,"Zampa to Jadhav, 1 run down the track and it's too flat and quick to get any elevation. Drags his slog along the ground to deep midwicket"
553,"Zampa to Pandey, FOUR runs down the track again, and this time Pandey puts it away. A difficult shot, because he fired it flat and full at his feet, and he had to quickly get his front leg out of the way to bring his bat down. He manages that, and whips it away hard, so hard it beats long-on's desperate dive to his right"
554,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, 2 runs bouncer, and Jadhav isn't in a great position for the hook. Needs to meet it above his right shoulder. Loops up in the air but falls safely in front of the man coming in from the long leg boundary. They manage to run two as well"
555,"Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, 1 run length ball, and he uses his wrists to meet that on a fourth-stump line and whip it through backward square leg"
556,"Coulter-Nile to Pandey, SIX runs wham! That's full on off stump, and he's cleared his front foot and simply flicked it over the midwicket boundary. What a shot that is! Almost a helicopter shot, without the full flourishing Dhoni finish"

566,"Cummins to Pandey, 2 runs shortish, close to off stump, makes some room and slaps it away to the left of deep point. Placed it sufficiently wide of that fielder to pick up two. Coulter-Nile was the man in the deep - he moved a little late, because initially it looked like Handscomb would move right from backward point and stop it, but he didn't quite reach the ball"
567,"Cummins to Pandey, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, dabbed down to third man"
568,"Cummins to Jadhav, FOUR runs short, wide, and cracked away. Such fast hands, and it screams away to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
569,"Cummins to Jadhav, no run set himself up for a similar ball, going deep in his crease with his back foot. Cummins cramped him for room this time, angling a back-of-a-length ball in towards middle stump. Chops it down into the pitch"
570,"Cummins to Jadhav, no run excellent bowling. This time Jadhav stepped out of his crease, and he nails a yorker right at his feet. Jams down to keep it out"
571,"Cummins to Jadhav, 1 leg bye out of his crease again and he gets a bit of inward nip with this back-of-a-length ball. Sneaks under the attempted horizontal-bat swat and hits his pad, high up"
572,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 1 run full-toss on off stump, flat-batted down to long-off"
573,"Kane Richardson to Pandey, 1 run now Richardson nails a yorker, on middle and leg. Gets his feet out of the way and stabs it away into the point region"
574,"Kane Richardson to Jadhav, 2 runs slower ball, full and wide, dragged down the ground to long-on. Wanted the big slog but it was too full to get any elevation. The throw at the bowler's end, from Warner, is fumbled by Richardson, and they sneak an overthrow"
575,"Kane Richardson to Pandey, 1 run down the track, making himself a bit of room. Doesn't quite nail the yorker and it's a driveable full ball on off stump. Drilled down the ground powerfully, but long-off moves quickly to his right to ensure it doesn't go for four"
576,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, 2 runs full on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg and the batsmen hurry through for two"
577,"Cummins to Axar Patel, 1 run length ball slanting across towards off stump. Pushes at it uncertainly, his feet aren't quite moving yet, and gets an outside edge down to third man"
578,"Cummins to Dhoni, FOUR runs back of a length, angling down leg, and Dhoni tucks it away fine, too fine for the man at fine leg to stop. Don't know if Cummins was a little put off by Dhoni's initial movement across the stumps"
579,"Cummins to Dhoni, no run down the track and he has an almighty heave across this short ball. Inside-edges past leg stump, and Wade throws himself to his left to stop it"

581,"Cummins to Dhoni, 1 run again a big step across his stumps. Cummins digs it in, just back of a length, angling into the body, and Dhoni swivels to pull to long leg"
582,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, no run shortish, too close to off stump to get the kind of power he wants with the cut. Straight to backward point"
583,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, no run slower ball wide of off stump, flat-batted hard but straight to extra-cover"
584,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, no run slower ball, fullish outside off. Another huge slog from Dhoni, loses his shape, and nearly inside-edges into his off stump. Wade dives left to make sure it doesn't run away behind him"
585,"Kane Richardson to Dhoni, SIX runs short outside off, and Dhoni's flat-batted it for six! Finally gets some leverage, some width, and he just slaps it away over the covers"
586,"Kane Richardson to Shami, no run slower short ball, angling down leg. Not the greatest of balls to bowl with fine leg inside the circle, but Shami only manages to swat it straight to that fielder"

595,"Coulter-Nile to Yadav, 1 run full on off stump, whipped in the air, on the bounce, to midwicket"
596,"Coulter-Nile to Shami, FOUR runs shot. Waist-high full-toss on middle and leg, and he moves away from the stumps to make a bit of swinging room and club it away over midwicket. The umpire suggests it's just below waist high"
597,"Coulter-Nile to Shami, no run back of a length outside off, Shami swings and misses, looking for the big drive over the covers"
