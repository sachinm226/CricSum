0,"10.15am: We'll have official news of the teams at the toss in about 15 minutes... but, word from the ground is that Sam Curran has received his ODI cap from James Anderson - so a debut for the Surrey allrounder. Will England make any more changes? If so, it'll most likely be to the attack, with Mark Wood a possibility to be rested."
1,"Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 Travis Head, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Marcus Stoinis, 5 D'Arcy Short, 6 Alex Carey, 7 Tim Paine (capt & wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Kane Richardson, 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Billy Stanlake."
2,"England 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Sam Curran, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Jake Ball"
3,"""Toss whitewash for AUSTRALIA!!!"" squawks Sohaib. He's right, good spot... Not that it's done Paine and his boys much good. Our first whitewash of the day?"
4,"10.40am: So, looks like Aaron Finch and Travis Head will open again, after their century stand up at Chester-le-Street, with Short slotting in down the order. No Glenn Maxwell, who presumably hasn't recovered from the shoulder problem that kept him out of the last game. England have a much-changed attack - but it's the batting that has done the damage in this series, as far as Australia are concerned."
5,"10.55am: Australia did win on their last trip to Old Trafford, an eight-wicket canter in 2015, after England had chosen to bat. This England side has usually been capable of a bad day at the office - almost sackable, really - in any given series, and they were 8 for 5 in Adelaide in January, during the last series between these sides. Will that fallibility come to Australia's aid today?"
6,"Right, it's a beautiful day at Old Trafford, Aaron Finch is facing up, and Jake Ball as the first new ball in hand. Two slips..."

30,"Sam Curran to Finch, SIX runs heaved over the leg side, that's sailed into the crowd at deep square! Maybe a slower ball, 75mph and Finch was aiming more down the ground... but he still got plenty on it!"
31,"Sam Curran to Finch, no run comes across and defends on off"
32,"Sam Curran to Finch, no run pitched up and driven, Moeen misfields at mid-off but Finch still sends Head back, think he was probably home as the throw came in"

45,"Ali to Head, 1 run tossed up, gets a slight leading edge through mid-off for one"
46,"Ali to Finch, OUT got him, Moeen strikes - snuck through into the timber! What a good series he's having, this just gripped and spun, cramping Finch as he swung across the line, clipped the bottom edge and then rattled the stumps"
47,"Ali to Stoinis, no run flat on off stump, Stoinis shows it a straight bat"
48,"Ali to Stoinis, OUT oh, what's he done...? Stoinis falls second ball, swept without timing straight to short fine leg! Good running catch from Ball, England have another. You could see what Stoinis was trying to do, but it was poorly executed, having barely had a sighter"

78,"Plunkett to Head, OUT on the body, Head is tucked up and loops the ball straight to midwicket! He looks at his bat in frustration, Head falls after making an attractive fifty once again...

87,"Plunkett to Carey, no run back of a length, pushed across from over the wicket and left alone"
88,"Plunkett to Carey, no run shortish, Carey tries to open the face and run a single, clips the inside edge and ricochets into the body but falls safely"

94,"Ali to Paine, OUT brilliant from Buttler! Dropped into the leg side, this is another tight single... and Buttler has raced after it and superbly thrown down the stumps at the bowler's end! Paine has run himself out, but it took some brilliant work from his rival stumper: scampering to his left, picking up and turning to throw unsighted, the ball just flicking off the bails - stupendous stuff!"

109,"Ali to Carey, FOUR runs quick delivery outside off, Carey goes across early and telegraphs his intention to ramp the ball, Buttler moves outside leg... but the flick beats him to his left, just a thick edge really but it runs away to fine leg for another boundary"

138,"Rashid to Carey, no run full at the stumps, driven to mid-off"
139,"Rashid to Carey, 1 run shovels a shorter delivery out to deep square leg"

155,"Sam Curran to Carey, OUT strikes first ball! Back of a length outside off, Carey has a nibble and it's a thin edge to Buttler. Just trying to steer it to third man. A maiden ODI wicket for Sam Curran"
156,"Sam Curran to Agar, no run full and straight, defended to the leg side"
157,"Sam Curran to Agar, OUT oh my goodness! He's left a straight one It goes from bad to worse for Australia. He's shoulder arms to a delivery that has hit middle and off. Unbelievable. He must have thought it was going to swing away. It certainly didn't. Would even have been too close to leave if he had moved! Jeepers"

169,"Sam Curran to Kane Richardson, no run good length outside off, defended to backward point"

179,"Rashid to Kane Richardson, OUT another run out? Yes, he's gone! The ball deflected off the pad to short fine leg, there was all sorts of confusion over the ball. Richardson eventually turned to get back. Brings out the dive but it's not enough. His bat is on the line (and in the air). An excellent take by Buttler, in front of the stumps, on the half volley"
180,"Sam Curran to Short, no run good length, angled into the pads, worked into midwicket"
181,"Sam Curran to Short, 2 runs full at the stumps, the bat twists in his hands as he works it through the leg side but he's able to get back to retain the strike"

189,"Rashid to Short, 1 run tucked off the pads to deep midwicket"
190,"Rashid to Lyon, no run attempts another sweep, the delivery is out as full, he misses and gets taken on the body"
191,"Rashid to Lyon, no run there's an appeal for lbw and then the catch...Root takes it at slip. Given not out for both and England review. The lbw looks outside the line. Was there an edge? There is a spike on Snicko. But was it bat hitting ground? Third umpire reckons so. I'm not so sure, but evidence has to be conclusive. The lbw was also well outside off, so England lose their review"

200,"Rashid to Lyon, OUT and he's done him! Skids through slowly, Lyon goes back to play the pull, doesn't make contact and that's right in front although Lyon, at the last moment, calls the review. Don't think so, Nathan. His back leg is bent right in front of the stumps. Smashing leg stump."

202,"Rashid to Stanlake, no run full outside off, he stretches forward and defends to backward point"

215,"Rashid to Stanlake, no run beaten again, lunging forward at a googly"
216,"Rashid to Stanlake, no run a muted appeal for a bat-pad catch as this loops up and Buttler hops around to collection"
217,"Ali to Short, FOUR runs super shot...skips down the pitch and lofts this straight down the ground"
218,"Ali to Short, 1 run shorter, flatter, he rocks back and drives to deep cover"
219,"Ali to Stanlake, no run full and straight, defended"
220,"Ali to Stanlake, OUT and that's all over! Stanlake plays back outside leg stump, a shortish delivery slides on with the angle from round the wicket. He's not in the same postcode and it clatters leg stump. Career-best for Moeen Ali"
221,"What a mess that was from Australia. All out with more than 15 overs unused. Most of the wickets handed on a plate to England. Spin again did plenty of damage and Sam Curran came back very nicely from an expensive start. Travis Head looked in good touch again before failing to convert, Alex Carey showed promise and D'Arcy Short did his best, but it was pretty dismal really. The innings has ended so swiftly that England will start"
222,"Hello again. This is all going scarily well for England... Not the cricket, that was expected, but the treadballers, who are 2-0 up in Nizhny Novgorod. And you wouldn't be surprised if a few Australian minds are beginning to think this football World Cup is worth getting invested in, given the way the cricket is going. One small consolation, perhaps, is that England can't break their own record for runs scored in a five-match ODI"
223,"Radical thinking straight up, with Ashton Agar taking the new ball from the James Anderson End. Jason Roy on strike, no slip..."
224,"Agar to Roy, no run angled in straight and Roy skips out, works the ball to mid-on"
