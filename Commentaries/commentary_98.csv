1,"Cummins to Root, 1 wide short ball, cross-seamer but it's down the leg side, Cummins appeals as Root pulls at it... but Fry immediately signals wide"
2,"Cummins to Root, no run good length outside off, Root shoulders arms coming across"
3,"Cummins to Root, 1 run pitched up, 142kph and Root drives, eased past cover but mid-off does well to cut it off on the dive"
4,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run angled in and turned short towards midwicket"
5,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run slower delivery, maybe a cutter from Cummins and Bairstow watches it on to the bat and works square"

7,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run length ball, 130kph outside off but it stays a bit low as YJB swats at it and misses"
8,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run short and wide and rasped on the cut, Smith was pretty close at backward point but gets a good hand on it and keeps them to one"
9,"Stoinis to Root, 3 runs length, driven on the up and that's all business from Root, timed through the covers and Warner has to pump the gas to catch up with the ball just in front of the rope"
10,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run pitched up and pushed into the off side"
11,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs dug in short, Bairstow rattles a pull through backward square, Cummins again surfs the wave along the boundary and one-hands it back in for deep square to field. [Jazz voice] Nice"

15,"Zampa to Root, 1 run floated up and punched through the off side as he reaches out for it"
16,"Zampa to Bairstow, no run rolls his arm over, full outside off and driven into the ground, Paine appeals for the caught-and-bowled - but that was clearly a bump ball"
17,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run pushed through outside off, punched past cover again"

21,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run full, 133kph outside off, Bairstow crunches a drive to the cover sweeper"

23,"Stoinis to Root, no run trundles in, wicket-to-wicket stuff and again the batsman works to the man at midwicket"
24,"Stoinis to Root, 2 runs fullish, uses the feet and dabs a drive through point, into an unguarded part of the field and they hurry back for two"

29,"Zampa to Bairstow, no run flighted, Bairstow tries to heave down the ground and completely mistimes it to mid-on"
30,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up nice and slow, draws a false shot as YJB reaches out and thick-edges one through backward square leg"
31,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run good length outside off, 131 kph, pushed to cover. Can't seem to force that through extra cover because of that lack of pace"
32,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run nice wicket to wicket bowling, full around off, hit back to the bowler"
33,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run looking to glide that off the open face to third man but the ball came back in - not sure seam movement or an offcutter. Dabbed to point instead. Three dots"
34,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run on the pads this time, 136.5 kph, flicked away to deep square leg"
35,"Stoinis to Root, 1 run full and a tad wide, allows Root to stride forward and punch to the sweeper cover for a run"
36,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs there is that dab to third man, gets two actually, fantastic running. On a length outside off, allows the ball to hit the bat, rather than going after it."
37,"Zampa to Root, no run doesn't matter if you're bowling full tosses, Root swats it away to a straight midwicket"
38,"Zampa to Root, 1 run nicely bowled, full on middle and leg, some drift in the air, worked away to deep square leg"
39,"Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run shortish and wide outside off, carved to deep point."
40,"Zampa to Root, FOUR runs excellent batting, learnt from his error off the first ball, knew midwicket was straight and square leg was wide so when he saw a short ball, he went back and swatted it over where a normal midwicket would have been"
41,"Zampa to Root, no run more drift, full and straight, hit back to the bowler"
42,"Zampa to Root, 1 run full outside off, carved to the sweeper cover with the full face of the bat."
43,"Marsh to Root, 1 run another good single. Full delivery, moving back in ever so slightly, patted away towards the keeper. Bairstow calls his partner through. Paine's soccer skill isn't the best, by the look of that attempt"
44,"Marsh to Bairstow, 3 runs in the air and juuust wide of midwicket. Fullish on middle, Bairstow clips the ball in the air, but just wide of the fielder, to his right"
45,"Marsh to Root, 1 run good length outside off, Root comes down and inside-halves the ball into his back thigh. Goes through his legs for a run. Ouch, could have been worse"
46,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run full delivery outside off, driven into the cover region"
47,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run short and wide outside off, Bairstow nails a cut but finds the impenetrable Steven Smith at backward point, who dives to his right to save two, maybe four"
48,"Marsh to Bairstow, no run excellent finish, that's where you want to be on this surface. Full and straight, defended back. A tidy over"
49,"Zampa to Root, no run was there some bat? 82 kph, very full outside off, Root shuffles right across and sweeps to short fine leg. Steven Smith speaks to Zampa, who is conversing with Paine. They rightly decide against the review"
50,"Zampa to Root, 1 run"
51,"Zampa to Bairstow, no run driven into the cover region"
52,"Zampa to Bairstow, FOUR runs lovely shot, some flight outside off, so much flight that Bairstow chooses not to move his feet and then lofts the ball neatly over cover. Didn't bother keeping it down"
53,"Zampa to Bairstow, OUT oh beautifully bowled. The previous one was the legbreak, this one was the googly. They both were really full, the length allowed Bairstow to throw his hands at the line without his feet. What that did was create a big gap between bat and pad, the legbreak found the middle of the bat, the googly found a massive gap between bat and"
54,"Zampa to Morgan, no run another googly, 82 kph, outside off, not much turn, defended back. Excellent length for a wristspinner in that over, rather be full than short for precisely that reason"
55,"Starc to Root, no run a full delivery outside off, dabbed towards backward point. Steven Smith picks up and throws at the bowler's end. Hits Morgan's bat, to the angst of the umpire. Could be to scruff up the ball."
56,"Starc to Root, 1 run full and wide outside off, driven elegantly to the sweeper cover"
57,"Starc to Morgan, FOUR runs don't think Starc will mind that too much, there is some late inward movement. Full and straight, maybe a tad too straight. Morgan just tickles that fine, to the fine leg boundary"
58,"Starc to Morgan, no run 140 kph, wide and full, sliced to the point fielder. Is there some reverse swing? You tend to get reverse quicker on an abrasive surface"
59,"Starc to Morgan, no run wow, probably what Australia were playing for, 141 kph outside off, gets the ball to jag back in. It takes the inside edge, hits the back pad and smells the paint of leg stump. An inch straighter and the leg bail would have fallen"
60,"Starc to Morgan, 2 runs full and wide outside off, neatly played this time, through cover for a couple. Played inside the line to account for that movement"
61,"Zampa to Root, 1 run too much flight, on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
62,"Zampa to Morgan, FOUR runs that's how Morgan plays, he backs a very productive shot and connects. Flat and straight, Morgan gets into a really good position and reverse-sweeps through backward point. Out if he missed, but it's a very safe shot for Morgan"
63,"Zampa to Morgan, 3 runs did he get some bat? Don't think so, but runs given. Lots of flight outside off, attempts another reverse-sweep but it's too full outside off. Paine is put off by that shot, goes through his legs"
64,"Zampa to Root, 1 run some drift on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
65,"Zampa to Morgan, no run shortish and wide, 88 kph, wary of the reverse-sweep again, hit to backward point"
66,"Zampa to Morgan, no run good end, slow but not full, 89 kph, Morgan gets forward and defends"
67,"Starc to Root, 1 run full and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover off the open face. So adept at finding gaps"
68,"Starc to Morgan, no run will go down as a drop but those ones either stick or they go through like this. Full and straight, Morgan drives back, can't keep it down. Starc sticks out a right hand, but the ball bursts through. Don't think he got a hand on it actually"
69,"Starc to Morgan, no run full and straight again, off the inside half to midwicket"
70,"Starc to Morgan, no run 141 kph, full on off, Morgan watches the ball onto his bat and defends. They'll look at playing Starc out"
71,"Starc to Morgan, no run wow, terrific yorker. On middle and leg, tailing back in ever so late. Morgan gets his bat down on it just in time and jams it out"
72,"Starc to Morgan, no run 124 kph, the slower bouncer or the ball just didn't travel after pitching? On middle and leg, the short delivery. Morgan watches it onto his bat, always wanted to play Starc out"
73,"Hazlewood to Root, no run 136 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to short cover. A hint of inward movement"
74,"Hazlewood to Root, OUT 135 kph, the first today but may not be the last. Root chops on. Was just saying Root is so good at finding gaps, and his natural instinct of trying to do so kicks in. It's a good length delivery outside off that seams back in, with Hazlewood's natural angle. The safer shot would have been playing with a full face, but Root tries"
75,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run another indicator of how slow this surface is, 141 kph outside off, hardly gets up, Buttler sways"
76,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run full on middle and leg, 136 kph, driven to mid-on"
77,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run full delivery outside off, defended into the point region."
78,"Hazlewood to Buttler, 1 run Buttler spoils the wicket maiden with a jammed drive into the gap at extra cover"
79,"Starc to Buttler, 1 run full delivery outside off from around the wicket, hit to deep cover. Looking for that off stump, or the one that got Buttler at the Gabba"
80,"Starc to Morgan, no run good length delivery around off, defended watchfully"
81,"Starc to Morgan, no run full delivery outside off, driven into the mid-off region."
82,"Starc to Morgan, no run 141 kph, short delivery, clever change in length, well directed too, Morgan sways away"
83,"Starc to Morgan, no run seams back in, 143 kph, on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket."
84,"Starc to Morgan, no run short around off, 142 kph, gets on top of the bounce so easily to bunt it away. Have to use the bouncer sparingly and to earn yourself a dot on a surface like this, the fuller ones are the wicket-takers"
85,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run good stop by Mitch Marsh. Full outside off, Buttler gets forward and drives to short cover's right. Marsh dives to his right"
86,"Hazlewood to Buttler, FOUR runs he hits it harder and better and Marsh can't stop this. Overpitched outside off, drilled through wide mid-off. Marsh dives to his right"
87,"Hazlewood to Buttler, 1 run dug in, short around middle and leg, a top edge on the pull to fine leg, lands well in front"
88,"Hazlewood to Morgan, 2 runs overpitched outside off, Morgan is a tad early through his drive, past cover for a couple."
89,"Hazlewood to Morgan, no run full and wide outside off, left alone, 139 kph"
90,"Hazlewood to Morgan, no run shortish delivery outside off, punched to that short point fielder"
91,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run 134 kph, tapped into the point region, just have to keep it there on this surface"
92,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run 129 kph, full delivery outside off, hit to the mid-off fielder. Slightly wide of him, to his left"
93,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run good length around off, 131 kph, skewed off the inside half to midwicket."

95,"Stoinis to Morgan, 1 run full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man, 133 kph"
96,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run 130 kph, very good over, not too pacey but accurate, around off, coming back in, defended back with the full face"
97,"Zampa to Morgan, 1 run 85 kph, Morgan gets low for a fine paddle sweep to short fine leg"
98,"Zampa to Buttler, 2 runs very good at these shots, flat on middle and off, reverse-swept away through backward point"
99,"Zampa to Buttler, 1 run 93 kph, pushed through, Buttler plays with the full face, can often mistake the flipper for a short delivery, pushed to long-off"
100,"Zampa to Morgan, 1 run slower but short, pushed to long-on for a single"
101,"Zampa to Buttler, 1 run some flight outside off, 83 kph, the swatty drive to long-off. Reached out for it."
102,"Zampa to Morgan, 1 run dropped by Steven Smith. Not easy but Smith will be disappointed. Short on middle and leg, pushed through. Slides on. Pulled to midwicket, where Smith gets low to his left, the ball pops out possibly off the wrists. Big moment in the game"
103,"Stoinis to Morgan, no run lots of edges on this surface. Full delivery outside off, Morgan closes his bat face too early, a thick leading edge falls well short of mid-off"
104,"Stoinis to Morgan, 1 run worked away off his hips to deep square leg"
105,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run 131 kph, Smith makes up one run, good length outside off, sliced off the open face to point where Smith dives to his right"
106,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run juuuust short of mid-off. A lot happening here. Full and wide outside off, Buttler wants to go over mid-off but the ball lobs towards the fielder off the inside half. Lands in front"
107,"Stoinis to Buttler, SIX runs he has had enough of plodding about. Full and straight, Buttler goes through with his lofted drive, not great timing but his muscle does the rest, over mid-on. Lands on the boundary cushion."
108,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run shortish and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover. Warner is very quick on the ball"
109,"Zampa to Buttler, 2 runs tossed up outside off, 87 kph, drilled through cover, lets his hands through the line. Two to deep cover"
110,"Zampa to Buttler, no run a flatter trajectory, on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
111,"Zampa to Buttler, 1 run lots of flight outside off, driven to long-off with the spin."

115,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run shortish delivery around off, 128 kph, worked away down to fine leg"
116,"Stoinis to Morgan, SIX runs big from Morgan. Stoinis sees Morgan coming so he shortens the length, Morgan swats it away, gets amazing timing and waaay over square leg. Sensational hit"

125,"Starc to Morgan, 1 run a low full toss around off, driven to the sweeper cover. Not quite found his consistency, but that isn't entirely unexpected with Starc's pace"
126,"Starc to Buttler, no run short delivery outside off, 138 kph, Buttler sways out of the line, drops his hands and lets it go."

150,"Hazlewood to Morgan, OUT gottim! Morgan tries to open the face but ends up gliding an edge to the keeper! Hazlewood makes the breakthrough, just as England were starting to look fluent again. Used the angle across Morgan, who played pretty well but is still searching for a major contribution"

156,"Cummins to Ali, 1 run round the wicket, pitched full and Moeen wafts a drive, gets an inside edge for one past his pads"
157,"Marsh to Ali, 1 run dropped! A howler from Cameron White! Moeen gets a life, top-edging an ungainly heave straight up, should be a regulation catch at cover... but it goes right through him, a bar of soap in the showers, didn't get a hand on it - very similar to Hazlewood in the SCG Test, actually - and Moeen survives!"

171,"Stoinis to Ali, 1 run pitched up and poked down the ground through mid-off"
172,"Marsh to Ali, OUT bowled him, Moeen drags on! He'll have to drag himself off, it's not been a fun tour with the bat for him... Back of a length, this time the ugly swipe goes down, rather than up, and raps the top of off stump - no chance for a fielder to mess things up and Marsh has a wicket"

207,"Cummins to Buttler, FOUR runs oh, foxy stuff from Buttler, he waltzes across and brings out the ice cream scoop, flicked straight over the keeper away!"
208,"Cummins to Buttler, no run slower ball, good length on off, Buttler taps it down"
209,"Cummins to Buttler, no run another cutter, taking the pace off as Buttler walks into line, tries a little short-arm flick but misses"

214,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run dabbed down on the off side"
215,"Hazlewood to Buttler, 1 run full, he saunters across and flicks through square leg, one to the sweeper"
216,"Hazlewood to Woakes, no run length, 136kph/84mph outside off and it creeps through a touch low, Woakes jabs it into the leg side and Buttler wanted one, has to turn sharpish and scoot back to his ground"
217,"Hazlewood to Woakes, 1 run shorter, this leaps at Woakes like an eager cocker spaniel, jabbed away off the bat handle for one"
218,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run shortish, deflected behind point via bat and pad, Woakes wanted it this time but Buttler wasn't coming... and Smith misses with a straightforward shy at the non-striker's end!"
219,"Hazlewood to Buttler, SIX runs maximum pain exacted moments later, Buttler creaming a flat six over long-off! The beast raises an eyebrow and bares its teeth"
220,"Cummins to Woakes, SIX runs short ball, slugged over the ropes at deep square leg! Woakes connects with a meaty pull and it sails for six, bringing up the England 250 in the process"
221,"Cummins to Woakes, 1 run short again but taking the pace off, he hops across and paddles this for one"
222,"Cummins to Buttler, no run Buttler backs away, another slower-bouncer from Cummins, following the batsman as he swipes and misses"
223,"Cummins to Buttler, 2 runs super placement, makes room and opens the face on a squirted drive through backward point, they get a couple as Stoinis puts in the dive on the rope"
224,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 run banged in and hammered on the pull, sweet as a nut, smooth like tropicana - but straight to deep midwicket on the bounce"
225,"Cummins to Woakes, no run short, another cutter, I think, flicks Woakes' bottom edge on the pull but bounces in front of Paine"
226,"Starc to Buttler, no run excellent start, fires in the yorker from round the wicket, Buttler can only jam it to backward point"
227,"Starc to Buttler, 2 runs dropped! Starc follows Buttler as he makes room, scooped off a length straight down the ground towards long-on... but Zampa grasses a difficult chance running in!"
228,"Starc to Buttler, no run short, taking the pace off cleverly again, Buttler can't connect"
229,"Starc to Buttler, FOUR runs another slower bouncer but Buttler connects with this one, boomed on the pull through square leg and the sweeper can't get to it despite a full-length dive"
230,"Starc to Buttler, FOUR runs oh, shot - the topspin forehand down the ground! Not quite the yorker and somehow Buttler gets under it and smashes four over mid-off with those graphite wrists!"

232,"Cummins to Woakes, 1 run length ball, Woakes clears the front leg but hammers a pull to deep midwicket"
233,"Cummins to Buttler, no run short ball, Buttler wants to ramp it but only toe-ends wide of the keeper... and there's a mix-up in the middle, both batsmen at the same end briefly, but Paine is unlucky in that his throw hits Buttler diving for his ground and it deflects to safety as Woakes scuttles back"
234,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 wide slams in the bouncer but Buttler thinks it's high and ignores it - and gets the wide"
235,"Cummins to Buttler, SIX runs smoked into the boundary boards, a fierce, flat pull and it goes all the way!"

237,"Cummins to Buttler, FOUR runs short ball, sits up to pull, this time Buttler arrows a jab into the gap at cow corner... he's now just four away from a remarkable ton!"
238,"Cummins to Buttler, (no ball) 1 run full toss from Cummins, flubbed into the leg side... but it's a no-ball on height!"
239,"Cummins to Woakes, FOUR runs and Woakes manages to skim it fine for four more! Cummins' figures take a beating, he strayed down the leg side and it skipped away from Paine for another boundary"
240,"Starc to Buttler, no run full and straight, goes for the reverse sweep... Australia appeal for lbw, and up goes Chris Gaffaney's finger! Buttler reviews straight away, however, and it looks like he hit it. Yes, quite a clear edge, then on to the front pad"
241,"Starc to Buttler, 1 run full on the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
242,"Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs Woakes gets this away, superbly placed, just a flick of the wrists and it's into the gap at cow corner!"
243,"Starc to Woakes, SIX runs banged in... and clobbered over the rope at deep backward square! Top-edged on the pull but there was no one out there and the six brings Woakes his fifty!"
244,"Starc to Woakes, 1 run yes, he will, Woakes digs out a yorker towards backward point, England raise 300 and Buttler gets his chance"
245,"Starc to Buttler, 2 runs goes full and straight, Buttler can't really get under the ball but he forces it past midwicket... they are coming back for two, Buttler raises his century from the last ball of the innnings! He leaps in jubilation as he completes the second, helmet off to salute the crowd! This has been a brilliant one-day innings from Buttler,"
246,"6.20pm: Lummy, what a finish that was! England added 102 from the last ten overs, Buttler and Woakes batting together throughout as all of the hard work put in by Australia's attack in the first four-fifths of the innings was undermined... Buttler went to his fifty from 52 balls in the 41st over, and only needed another 31 to double up. We know he's capable of"
247,6.35pm A quick turnaround. Mark Wood to bowl. Finch and Warner.
248,"Wood to Finch, no run good length on middle and leg, 142 kph, pushed towards midwicket"
249,"Wood to Finch, 4 leg byes poor delivery. Strays down leg, off the thigh pad and past the keeper. Four leg byes to fine leg. All free runs for Australia."
250,"Wood to Finch, no run lovely channel, just around off, 145.4 kph, played to midwicket, that strong bottom hand was evident"
251,"Wood to Finch, no run full, a yorker around off, jammed out to cover"
252,"Wood to Finch, no run 146 kph, full delivery outside off, Finch stays back, should have been forward, toe-ended back up the pitch"
253,"Wood to Finch, 3 runs lovely shot, back of a length outside off, Finch stays back and just punches a sliced push through cover point. Pulled inside just inside by a diving Morgan"
254,"Woakes to Finch, no run good length delivery outside off, blocked back"
255,"Woakes to Finch, FOUR runs beautifully played. Slightly short, and he loves them there. Just swivels on a pull and finds the gap behind square for four."

257,"Woakes to Finch, 1 run good length outside off, 136 kph, Finch opens the bat face and carves a glide to third man"
258,"Woakes to Warner, OUT tries to force the ball through cover, but his balance was terrible. And all he can do is chip his wicket away to extra cover. Was around full, on a length. Warner stayed back to a ball he should have been forward to. Instead of adjusting his shot, he goes through with what he wanted to play, a forceful punch from the back foot, but"
259,"Woakes to White, 1 run good length delivery on middle, a 138 kph, thick inside edge to fine leg"
260,"Wood to White, no run dug in, short around off, defended back. Wood sprawls over, head first into the surface. Lovely day to go head first into a deep pool, but an unpleasant experience on a cricket field"
261,"Wood to White, no run shortish outside off, punched off the back foot to point"
262,"Wood to White, no run tidy channel, around off, blocked"
263,"Wood to White, no run 142 kph, shortish again, think Wood is getting slightly carried away with that length. Not quite the surface to do this, short around off, pulled to square leg"

267,"Woakes to White, no run good length delivery outside off, played into the point region from the crease"
268,"Woakes to White, FOUR runs drifts on the pads and White picks him off through midwicket for three. Nicely played, just let the ball come to him before working the ball away. Hales picks up near the boundary, and throws the ball back but a shoe is in contact with the boundary."
269,"Woakes to White, no run full delivery outside off, may have kept a tad low, played away towards point"
270,"Woakes to White, no run this one bounces extra, 132 kph, good length on middle and leg, some extra climb hits the splice of the bat. Toe-end and now splice off consecutive balls, of very similar lengths. In fact, this one was marginally fuller than the previous one"

277,"Wood to White, 1 run 142 kph, on middle and leg, worked away towards midwicket. A hand on it from the fielder takes some pace off the ball"
278,"Wood to Finch, no run nice end, 141 kph, tidy around off, defended back"
279,"Woakes to White, no run back of a length outside off, 132 kph, came on slower than White expected, defended back"
280,"Woakes to White, FOUR runs beautiful batting. Slightly overpitched from Woakes, White gets underneath the length early and lofts the ball over cover. A very T20 stroke, but works very well in ODIs too"

282,"Woakes to White, 1 run 135 kph, on a length, down leg, nudged to deep square leg"

286,"Wood to White, no run full on middle and leg, 141 kph, pushed to midwicket"
287,"Wood to White, OUT edged and gone! A start for White but he perishes looking to force the ball through point. May have been done in by some extra bounce. Back of a length delivery outside off, White looks to hit the ball through point but all he can get is a thin outside edge. Was actually looking quite solid on a tricky surface"

292,"Plunkett to Smith, 1 run shortish delivery around off, Smith walks across and nudges to square leg for one"

316,"Root to Finch, no run shortish and wide, scythed away into the point region"
317,"Root to Finch, no run worked away towards midwicket"
318,"Root to Finch, 3 runs flat and quick down leg, Finch looks for a hard sweep, but can only get a bit of bat on it. The ball races down to the fine leg boundary, pulled up just inside the boundary by Bairstow, fantastic stop"

320,"Root to Finch, no run short down leg, Finch has backed away quite a bit, chopped to point"
321,"Ali to Smith, 3 runs drifts on the pads, Smith just tickles him fine, aware that the fine leg fielder is very square. Three to fine leg"
322,"Ali to Finch, 1 run what was Finch doing there? He should have ran two. Full outside off, Finch stays in his crease and mis-times a lofted drive over mid-off. Doesn't move for quite a bit, plonks over mid-off."

324,"Ali to Finch, no run flat and straight, cut off the stumps towards short third man"

329,"Root to Smith, 1 run too full from Root, whipped away to deep midwicket"
330,"Root to Finch, FOUR runs whoopsy. On the pads, Finch works the ball over midwicket, a chip shot. Over midwicket. Woakes runs around from long-on, looking to flick the ball to the square leg fielder. But he over-runs it and allows the ball go to the boundary. Not a happy afternoon for him to come"

348,"Rashid to Smith, no run tossed up and Smith cuts in front of square, he wants one but Finch is less keen and Woakes swoops to keep them honest"
349,"Rashid to Smith, 1 run pushed through flat, driven playing back and Root misfields at extra cover to give them one"
350,"Rashid to Finch, no run goes up for lbw, this skidding on into the front pad as Finch went to sweep... outside the line, maybe? Or perhaps he got something on it, as England don't contemplate the review"

352,"Root to Finch, SIX runs here he goes, steps out and clubs over long-on, a hefty swipe and that clears long-on, bringing Finch his half-century!"

355,"Root to Smith, 1 run lobbed down on middle and leg, Smith works the single"
356,"Root to Finch, 1 run flat, no turn and nudged through midwicket"
357,"Rashid to Finch, OUT tosses up the legbreak, Finch goes to sweep, hit on the pads - and given! Finch immediately signals for a review, seeming to suggest he got some bat on it... but there's no bottom edge on the replays, and Hawk-Eye has it clipping leg stump! It was very close to sliding by but umpire's call is all England needed. Huge wicket, no hund"

440,"Wood to Smith, OUT throws the hands, thick edge and Buttler snaffles a terrific low grab! Wood is delirious as he charges off...but Smith isn't walking. This is going to the TV umpire, and the soft signal is out, which could be crucial. Has he got fingertips under it? This is going to be incredibly tight, it's a fantastic effort from Buttler, but is the"

457,"Rashid to Stoinis, SIX runs that's a confident shot. And runs give you confidence. Runs down to a good wristspinner early in his innings, backs his ability, gets to the pitch and drills a drive over mid-on. All the way"

467,"Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run the googly on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
468,"Rashid to Marsh, OUT taken at long-on. And Australia stumble further. This is a huge moment, the set man has picked out long-on. There have been so many dismissals where a batsman mistakes a flat legspinner for a long-hop. Happened to Guptill against Zampa at this ground, think it was last year. Marsh goes back and looks to pull over midwicket, but the"

An iffy moment with Steven Smith's dismissal, but England thorough and clinical agai"
