307,They have given India something to defend here albeit it is still 40 short of the average first innings score at this ground.
308,It was the third-best 6th wicket partnership for India in ODI cricket .
309,"6.38pm We're all set to resume. Marnus Labuschagne joins Aaron Finch at the top of the order, and Jasprit Bumrah has the first of the two new balls."
310,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
311,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run ooh, what a delivery. Back of a length, angling in, pitching in the fifth-stump channel, jagging away off the seam, and then swinging late as well, after it's passed the batsman's uncertain jab"
312,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run and again. This one pitches even closer to off stump before straightening past the edge. Labuschagne had to play at it, and the length just left his feet frozen"
313,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run ooh, Bumrah likes this pitch. Similar line to the first two balls, but this keeps going with the angle with some extra bounce. Labuschagne does well to get on his toes, ride the bounce, and defend it by his feet"

315,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run back of a length outside off, jags in off the seam this time and sneaks past the inside edge as Labuschagne looks to punch through cover. Kept a little low too"
316,"Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length, slanting across to off stump, punched to mid-off"
317,"Natarajan to Finch, no run full, angling across to off stump, tiny bit of shape back in. Gets forward for a push to mid-off"
318,"Natarajan to Finch, SIX runs drops short now, and it only gets up to about stomach height, just outside off. Finch swivels and dumps it over the forward square leg boundary. Welcome to international cricket!"
319,"Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length close to off stump, chopped into the point region"
320,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 run short, but this time it gets up to chest height, and closer to Finch's body with the line. Helped down to fine leg for a single"
321,"Natarajan to Labuschagne, no run short, some width too, but the angle away from the right-hander defeats Labuschagne, who looks to cut without getting across with his back foot"
322,"Bumrah to Finch, no run and again, past the outside edge. Bumrah angles it in, hits that hard length in the corridor, and straightens it past a hesitant defensive prod"
323,"Bumrah to Finch, no run slightly fuller length, angling in towards off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
324,"Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended into the covers"

328,"Natarajan to Finch, no run length ball slanting across towards off stump, gets forward to punch towards cover point"
329,"Natarajan to Finch, FOUR runs shot! That isn't a short ball, it's on off stump, and Finch is waiting for something marginal like that, and he simply half-swivels and swats it between midwicket and mid-on. Dismissive"
330,"Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, punched to short extra-cover"
331,"Natarajan to Finch, no run length ball angling in towards off stump, gets forward to defend into the on side"

333,"Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
334,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run there, again. This could even be outswing. Length ball, fifth-stump channel, and it veers away against the angle as Labuschagne pokes at it with an angled bat. Beaten comprehensively"
335,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run again that movement, and this time Labuschagne pulls out of his stroke halfway and leaves it alone"
336,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, 1 run back of a length outside off, waits on it and carves to third man"
337,"Bumrah to Finch, SIX runs fullish, angling in towards off stump, and that's some timing. Just stands there, stays slightly leg-side of the ball, and slices a six over point. He may have wanted to hit over cover, and the bat may have spun in his hands"

339,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball on the stumps, clipped down to mid-on"
340,"Natarajan to Labuschagne, OUT Natarajan on the board. India's first wicket in Powerplays this series. What a moment for Natarajan. Not the most spectacular one. Not something you see when you dream of a maiden wicket. This is short, just outside off, Mar"

342,"Natarajan to Smith, no run fuller, angling in, defended to short midwicket"
343,"Natarajan to Smith, no run short of a length, just outside off, Smith shuffles across to work this to short midwicket again"
344,"Natarajan to Smith, no run fuller, but not driving length, Smith is back and across to push this back to him"
345,"Natarajan to Smith, no run wicket-maiden for Natarajan. What a start. This one holds its line in front of off, squares him up, and takes a soft outside edge to point"
346,"Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs rare outright bad ball from Bumrah, wide half-volley. Finch gets forward and drives between cover and mid-off"
347,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball close to off stump, defended with an open face to backward point"
348,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to mid-on. Hung in the air briefly but no worries for Finch"
349,"Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length, skids through with maybe a bit of inward movement, and beats the attempted flick. Hits him on the thigh pad"
350,"Bumrah to Finch, no run edged, and put down! He's been getting the ball to nip away in the corridor all through this spell, and he hits the perfect length with this ball, full enough so the movement finds the edge rather than beating it. Finch is half-fo"
351,"Bumrah to Finch, 4 leg byes back of a length, angling down leg, and Finch misses his flick but picks up four leg-byes to the fine leg boundary. Insult to injury"
352,"Natarajan to Smith, no run full, angling into off stump, punched to mid-on"
353,"Natarajan to Smith, (no ball) 1 run length ball, aiming towards top of off. Steps across and clips towards midwicket. No-ball too, but they could have got a wicket with it. Pandya moved quickly to his right at midwicket while Finch was slow to take off"
354,"Natarajan to Finch, no run Natarajan goes for the yorker, and Finch, probably expecting it, looks for the reverse-ramp past short third man. Misses, and the ball rolls down to the keeper off the back pad"
355,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball angling into the stumps. Half-hearted appeal as Finch walks across to flick and misses. The impact, again, was outside off stump. Ball ricochets wide of slip for a leg-bye"
356,"Natarajan to Smith, 1 run length ball angling into the stumps. Steps across, meets it in line with off stump, and nearly beats short fine leg with the flick. Bumrah throws himself to his left and saves three runs"
357,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 wide he's been seeing Finch stepping across his stumps repeatedly. Looks for the full one on leg stump to try and bowl him behind his legs, but ends up firing down a leg-side wide"
358,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 wide shortish, down the leg side, Finch looks to pull and misses"
359,"Natarajan to Finch, FOUR runs overpitched. Wide-ish half-volley, and Finch shuffles down the pitch and drives smoothly to the right of extra-cover"
360,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 run length ball angling in towards off stump, steps forward and across and clips through square leg"
361,"Bumrah to Finch, no run dropped again. This is a much more difficult catch. Fullish, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Pushes at it with firm hands, and it pops back to Bumrah at around chest height, to his left. Sticks his hand out, but"
362,"Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region"
363,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball, fourth-stump channel. Finch looks to get forward but his weight isn't fully forward as he looks to punch this down the ground. Ends up inside-edging into his pad"
364,"Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
365,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run what a charmed life Finch is leading. Length ball angling into off stump, and this one bounces out of nowhere. Straightens slightly too. Looks to work it with the angle, and the ball pops up in the air, off the leading edge, but in"
366,"Bumrah to Smith, no run length ball outside off, left alone"
367,"Thakur to Finch, FOUR runs go on, just throw your bat at everything. Nothing's going to go to hand anyway. Down the track to a length ball that nips away off the pitch, and he drives with bat far out in front of his body. Thick edge, flies in the air to"
368,"Thakur to Finch, no run length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
369,"Thakur to Finch, no run down the track again, Thakur shortens his length slightly and Finch flat-bats to extra-cover"
370,"Thakur to Finch, no run looks to step out again, and Thakur gets this one to nip back in slightly to beat the flick. Half-hearted appeal, the ball was probably heading down leg"

372,"Thakur to Smith, 1 run fullish, angling into middle and off. Lets it come and clips to the right of midwicket"

375,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track but he can't get to the pitch of this loopy one just outside leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball hits his front pad"
376,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track, and again he fails to reach the pitch of the ball. Wrong'un this time, past the other side of his flick to hit him on the body"
377,"Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run back of a length, spins down leg slightly, goes back and works it to deep backward square leg"
378,"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run short on leg stump, rocks back and swats a pull to deep backward square leg"
379,"Thakur to Smith, no run full outside off, a bit of late outswing. Driven firmly to mid-off"
380,"Thakur to Smith, OUT got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it"
381,"Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs angling down leg again, but no shuffle from Henriques. Just clips it away neatly to the fine leg boundary"
382,"Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs back of a length, a bit of width, and Henriques stands tall and slaps it between backward point and cover point. What a start!"

389,"Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
390,"Kuldeep to Finch, no run beaten on the flick, not much of an lbw appeal because this was spinning down leg. A bit of flight and dip, and the ball beat the inside edge. Oh, hang on, India have reviewed! Kuldeep has bowled a better length through this ove"
391,"Thakur to Henriques, no run back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to the left of backward point, where Jadeja makes his customary diving save. Henriques took off for a single and then had to turn around hurriedly and throw himself into the crease"

402,"Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run length ball, pitching on off stump and spinning further away. Waits on the back foot, watches it turn, and then punches to long-off. Clearly hanging back and looking to play it off the pitch, is Henriques. Kuldeep will want t"

404,"Jadeja to Henriques, no run tossed up slow and wide, looks to step across and sweep. Through it too soon and he's hit on the back"

530,"Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell's hit this one out of the park too. Quick feet to get on the back foot with hips open, and even quicker hands to pull it waay over midwicket. It's landed on the stadium roof and roll"

617,"Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. B"
618,"Maxwell could, and possibly should, have won this game for Australia, but he made a significant contribution for the third successive innings, and he's put that horror IPL far, far behind him. I thought Agar and Zampa bowled really well for Australia too."
619,"10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled In"
