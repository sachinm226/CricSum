241,"Yadav to Jhye Richardson, 1 run full toss on the stumps, pushed to long-on but hit too hard to turn for two"
242,"Yadav to Cummins, FOUR runs full toss on off, and he pierces the cover field to turn the match Australia's way again"
243,"Yadav to Cummins, 2 runs full on middle, just past the diving bowler and the lack of power behind the stroke ensures they get through for two and finish on the right side of this cliffhanger"
244,"Wow, what a cracker we've witnessed at Vizag, which saw a tie the last time India were here. Again, it's a last ball finish which went down to the throw hurled at the bowler's end, beaten by a scampering Jhye Richardson. Australia were coasting with Maxwell and Short, batted like blind men groping in the dark post their dismissals, a brilliant 19th"
245,"Kohli Very pleased with the bowling effort, never thought we'd be in this situation but Bumrah can do wonders, even Mayank bowled brilliantly, I thought. We want to give Rahul and Rishabh game-time. Rahul played a really good knock, we had a good partnership, had we gone on though, we could have got 150, which would have been a match-winning score"
246,"That's all from us, hoping everyone has their fingernails in tact, goodnight."
