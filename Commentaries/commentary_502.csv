1,"Mortaza to Warner, no run length ball, on leg stump, Warner gets forward and looks to flick but can't get it away"
2,"Mortaza to Warner, 1 run sliding down leg and Warner makes connection with the nudge to square leg. He is away"
3,"Mortaza to Watson, no run ooh, big left from just back of a length, and took Watto by surprise as he shaped to cut. Thudded into the keeper's gloves at good pace"
4,"Mortaza to Watson, 1 run good line, slightly fuller outside off, Watson opens the face and runs it down to third man"
5,"Mortaza to Warner, no run on middle and off, draws Warner out and he off drives without much power straight to mid off. Good start from Mortaza"
6,"Shafiul to Watson, no run short of a length and Watto cannot capitalise. He mistimes the pull, a trifle early into the shot and it goes straight to midwicket"
7,"Shafiul to Watson, 1 wide slides down the leg side for the first wide of the day"
8,"Shafiul to Watson, no run angles in and raps him on the pads in front of middle and leg. Good ball, but it was sliding down the leg"
9,"Shafiul to Watson, 2 runs length ball angling into Watto who gets on the front foot and swings his arms to send it over midwicket. Not timed too well, still gets a couple"
10,"Shafiul to Watson, 1 run straight ball on middle, dropped to the leg side for a single"
11,"Shafiul to Warner, SIX runs he's smashed the cover off that one! Short of a length and angling across Warner without much pace, he had enough room to free his arms and swat that high over long off. Clean hit"
12,"Shafiul to Warner, FOUR runs goes the other way, it was marginally fuller and straighter this time, so Warner decided to despatch it over mid on. One bounce over the ropes."
13,"Mortaza to Watson, OUT Watto's gotta go! Mashrafe bowled a great first over, and now gets his reward with a very well-directed bouncer. That was fast and directed at Watto's body, he was hustled into the pull and was quite late on it. The top edge went high and when it came down, it landed in the hands of Aftab Ahmed who took a good tumbling catch."

16,"Mortaza to Warner, 1 run cross batted hard to mid on, where it is fielded well, tumbling to the right"
17,"Mortaza to Clarke, no run case of ball hitting the bat! Good signs for the tournament, this pitch is nice and quick. mashrafe bangs it in short of a length and Clarke hangs back and defends to the off side"
18,"Mortaza to Clarke, no run good finish to the over, short of a length again with a little shape away from Clarke and good carry. The Aussie captain makes the right decision - do nothing"
19,"Shakib to Warner, no run good start from Shakib, troubles Warner outside off"
20,"Shakib to Warner, OUT and he gets his second ball! Warner does not play spin very well, and the previous ball sowed some seeds of doubt in his head, possibly. He was down the track this time, did not get to the pitch as it turned into him and still went with the loft over midwicket. He did not time it too well and the catch was taken well by the fielder running in"
21,"Shakib to Clarke, no run speared into the right hander, who defended it straight"
22,"Shakib to Clarke, no run shortens the length marginally, he gets forward and defends"

32,"Shafiul to Clarke, 1 run driven down to mid off this time and well run for a quick single. They took on the fielder this time"
33,"Shafiul to Haddin, 1 leg bye drifting on to the pads and Haddin is unable to exact full toll. Misses the swing to leg side, but gets a leg bye"
34,"Shafiul to Clarke, no run angles in again, from outside off on to leg and Clarke can't do much with it as he looks to work it away into the leg side"
35,"Shafiul to Clarke, 1 run oooh, another tight single and I dare say a direct hit could have had them sweating. Good length again, short of a length and he could not time the cover drive. It went straight to cover, but the fielder could not get in a good throw"
36,"Shafiul to Haddin, 1 run drilled straight back and Shafiul does well to half stop it and it nearly hits the stumps at the bowler's end"

40,"Razzak to Hussey, 1 run short of a length, on legstump and straightening. Defended to cover"
41,"Razzak to Clarke, no run big turn, ripping across the batsman who stayed back and defended"

58,"Ashraful to Hussey, 1 run pitched up on leg stump, driven powerfully to long on"
59,"Ashraful to Clarke, OUT the skipper is gone! Australia are stuttering here, and Clarke's played an unnecessary shot to give his wicket away. Pitched up on off stump, Clarke was out of his crease and looked to loft it over long off, but did not hit it well enough to clear the ropes. It went straight to the fielder in the outfield"
60,"Ashraful to Hussey, 1 run Dropped by Jahurul at long off! Hussey plays a carbon copy of Clarke's brain-freeze shot, but times it a little worse, so jahurul had to run in, he got to the ball, and then put it down as he was tumbling forward."

65,"Mortaza to White, 1 run it's all happening! Played softly off the backfoot straight to point, and Hussey hustles across for a quick single as the fielder swoops in and under-arms a throw that misses. He would have been in, in any case"
66,"Mortaza to Hussey, OUT Australia have lost half their side! Another well-directed bouncer from Mortaza, hurrying Hussey into the pull shot, the top edge balloons behind square on the leg side, Mushfiqur runs across and takes it with the big gloves. Game on folks!"

77,"Shakib to Hussey, 1 run full on off, driven to long on off the front foot"
78,"Shakib to White, OUT See you later Mr. White! Lovely bit of left-arm spin bowling from Shakib, White tried to double guess him by moving to the leg side, Shakib stuck to his guns and bowled the stock ball on leg and middle, it turned away and beat White's attempted prod to crash into the furniture!"
79,"Shakib to Smith, 1 run pitched up, Smith is down the track and gets to the pitch to drive to wide long on and get off the mark"

83,"Ashraful to Smith, 1 run swept away square to the deep for a single"
84,"Ashraful to Hussey, 2 runs pitched up on off, Hussey drops it to point and takes off for a tight single. A direct hit could have got him, he put in a big dive to get in. What's more, he was alert to get up and return for the overthrow"
85,"Ashraful to Hussey, 1 run works it away to the legside this time to keep the score-card ticking. Hussey is crucial to the cause"
86,"Mortaza to Hussey, SIX runs Incredible timing! Full toss on leg stump, but they still have to be out away. Hussey stood his ground and flicked it nonchalantly over square leg for a six"
87,"Mortaza to Hussey, 1 run works this one behind square for a single. Hussey is playing a wonderful hand here"
88,"Mortaza to Smith, 1 run ah, he misses out with the paddle sweep. Times it well from the leg stump line, but it goes straight to the only fielder in that region, inside the circle"
89,"Mortaza to Hussey, FOUR runs Mashrafe is losing the plot after a fine spell until now. This one again is on leg stump, as all the previous balls this over, with fine leg in the circle. Hussey says thank you very much mate and redirects the ball behind square leg"
90,"Mortaza to Hussey, FOUR runs expertly played! Finally Ashrafe gets it outside off, but there was enough room for Hussey to make a measured surgical cut to send it scurrying fine to the third man fence"
91,"Mortaza to Hussey, 1 run cuts it away hard straight to cover for a single. Great over for Aus."

102,"Razzak to Hussey, 1 run pitched up on off, dabbed to the off side for a quickie"

105,"Shafiul to Hussey, 2 runs overpitched on off stump, Hussey gets forward and drives to wide long off"

109,"Shafiul to Hussey, 1 run again drives straight to Shakib who fumbles and Hussey gladly steals a single"
110,"Shafiul to Smith, 2 runs nicely played, it was short of a length outside off, Smith unfurled a nice looking square drive, that went to the left of point. It was tagged by third man running across near the ropes"
111,"Razzak to Smith, SIX runs Butchered! Shorter boundary on the leg side, and Smith went for it, with the expansive hoick over midwicket. Times perfectly"
112,"Razzak to Smith, 1 run down the track and goes through with the drive to extra cover"
113,"Razzak to Hussey, 1 run swings it to the leg side and takes another tight single"

119,"Shafiul to Hussey, 1 run good death bowling from Shafiul, he keeps it full outside off and Hussey can't get under it or time the swipe to long on. Just a single"
120,"Shafiul to Smith, 1 run another good yorker on leg stump, Smith does what he can and works it away to short fine leg for a single"
121,"Shafiul to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey jumps out to convert the yorker into a hittable ball and takes it on the full, he drives it from outside off to the left of the fielder at long on who does extremely well to cover ground and fire in a sharp throw, but the bowler fails to collect cleanly as he tries to break the stumps. That is a missed run-out chance."
122,"Shafiul to Hussey, 1 wide, OUT Smith is run out. That was very wide outside off and Hussey could not connect as he stretched out. Smith was eager to run across and nearly made his ground, but Rahim's under-arm got him just short of the crease. Great innings from Smith"
123,"Shafiul to Harris, 2 runs Harris drives to long off without any timing, so there was enough time to come back for the second. Good last over from Bangladesh, despite going for seven off the last two balls"
124,Lots to watch out for - should be an interesting chase.
125,"If Bangladesh chase this in 19 or fewer overs, Pakistan will be knocked out of the tournament. On the other hand, if Bangladesh bat out of their skins and get there in under 14.4 overs, Australia will miss out on the next stage, while Pakistan will go through with Bangladesh on net run rate. In other words, if Bangladesh chase the target in anything between 14.4 and 19 overs, Pakistan will be out of the tournament."
126,"Mike Hussey has turned in the kind of performance Australia has come to expect from him. Australia were in big trouble when he came in, and in characteristic style, Hussey has turned it around with a smart innings. Steven Smith gave him sound support and Australia have recovered thanks to their stand of 74 in 7 overs. Still Bangladesh will fancy their chances, and Pakistan will be watching this game with a little bit"
127,"Shakib walks in. For me, he holds the key."
128,"Tait to Imrul, no run fast and furious outside off, swing and a miss, bangs into Haddin's gloves"
129,"Tait to Imrul, no run serious pace from Tait, that was a great bouncer headed straight for Kaye's helmet, he did well to duck under it"
130,"Tait to Imrul, 4 leg byes ooh, that's going as fast as they are coming into the batsman. Fast on the batsman's thighs, he awkwardly fends, it goes off his body very fast and fine for four leg byes"

135,"Nannes to Ashraful, OUT taken! Great catch from Tait at third man. Ashraful played it well actually, angling the bat and looking to play the short ball down to third man, but timed it too well. It carried to the deep, and Tait ran across to take a nice tumbling catch inches off the turf. Well, you can forget all the run rate calculations unless Bangladesh make a fist of this chase"

148,"Nannes to Mahmudullah, no run length ball angling across, defended off the back foot"

157,"Tait to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs good shot, he attempts the same stroke that contributed to Ashraful's demise, but upper cuts it very fine from short of a length. It flies away and thuds into the bounday boards at third man."
158,"Tait to Mushfiqur, 1 run straightens the line and Rahim defends it down the ground"
159,"Nannes to Mushfiqur, 1 run opens the face and runs it down to third man from outside off"
